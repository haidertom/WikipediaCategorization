'''Agricultural spiritualism''' or the '''Spirit of Agriculture''' refers to the idea that the concepts of [[food]] [[production (economics)|production]] and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and the essential [[spiritualism|spiritual]] nature of [[human race|humanity]] are linked. It assumes that spirituality is inherent to human [[consciousness]], is perhaps a product of it, and is accessible to all who cultivate it. The association with [[agriculture]] includes such agricultural [[metaphor]]s as "cultivate" in language used by most [[mysticism|mystics]] across history.

Followers of this idea state the following reasons to justify this link:
*Agriculture was the preoccupation of the majority of the [[population]] of the world at the time that the major [[scripture]]s of the continuing [[religion]]s were compiled.
*The approach that agriculture takes to creating the optimal conditions for production of its [[harvest]] is the same as that recommended by the traditional religions for producing insight or wisdom.
*Historically, the adoption of agriculture liberated part of a population to focus on understanding of spirituality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">[[Image:Vank Cathedral - Heaven-Earth-Hell fresco.jpg|thumb|A fresco showing heaven above, and hell below, [[Vank Cathedral]], Iran]]
The '''allegory of the long spoons''' is a [[parable]] that shows the difference between heaven and hell by means of people forced to eat with long spoons. It is attributed to Rabbi Haim of [[Rumšiškės|Romshishok]], as well as other sources.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-23/features/sns-201208221330--tms--godsqudctngs-a20120823-20120823_1_remarkable-story-heaven-text|title=Famous spiritual story varies among faiths and cultures, but carries the same message|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[hell]] the people are unable to lift food to their mouths using such unwieldy cutlery, and are starving. In [[heaven]], the diners feed one another across the table and are sated. The story can encourage people to be kind to each other. There are [[#Interpretation|various interpretations]] of the fable including its [[#sermons|use in sermons]] and in advice to lonely people.

== Interpretation ==
The story suggests that people have the opportunity to use what they are given (the long spoons in this allegory) to help nourish each other, but the problem, as Haim points out, lies in how the people treat each other.

Given the same level playing field one group of people who treat each other well will create a pleasant environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how they treat each other. Writer [[Dawn Eden]] suggests that this is a simple truth which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.&lt;ref name="eden" /&gt;

== Variations ==
The long spoons allegory has become part of the [[folklore]] of several cultures, for example: Jewish,&lt;ref name=allegory&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabbi|first=Haim|title=Narrative of the allegory|url=http://www.hodu.com/parable.shtml|work=Citation source|publisher=Hodu|accessdate=6 Aug 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204060500/http://hodu.com/parable.shtml|archive-date=2011-02-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu,&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite web|last=Lord|first=Shiva|title=Hindu parable: A Long Handled Spoon|url=http://www.forwardsteps.com.au/LongHandledSpoon.html|work=Swami|accessdate=5 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horn|first=Nils|title=Yoga Basic Knowledge and Exercises By|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oriental&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peseschkian|first=Nossrat|title=Oriental stories as tools in psycho therapy|year=1986|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Christian.&lt;ref name="eden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tietze|first=Harald W|title=Happyology|publisher=The Pope tells the story of the long spoons|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, the food in the story is a bowl of stew; in China, it is a bowl of rice being eaten with long chopsticks.&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt;

In some versions of the story the diners are using regular cutlery but are unable to bend their arms,&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt; with a story attributed to Rabbi Haim of Romshishok describing how "both arms were splinted with wooden slats so he could not bend either elbow to bring the food to his mouth".

During [[conflict resolution]] in non-Western cultures{{which|date=May 2014}} communicating difficult truths is better through a third party who can make suggestions through such stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swami|first=Vinod|title=Conflict Mediation Across Cultures|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and popular culture==
&lt;span id="sermons"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;While the parable itself is seldom depicted in art, it is well known and used in sermons when referring to hell, where the fashion for depicting hell in terrible, painful, gruesome terms is fading in recent times.&lt;ref name="eden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eden|first=Dawn|title=The Thrill of the Chaste: Finding Fulfillment While Keeping Your Clothes On|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8499-1311-2|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parable is told by [[Norman McCay]] in the novelization of ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. In the 2011 [[Boardwalk Empire]] episode, "Under God's Power She Flourishes", Father Brennan tells Margaret the Allegory of the Long Spoons while Emily is fitted for leg braces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2046372/synopsis?ref_=tt_ft|title="Boardwalk Empire" Under God's Power She Flourishes (2011) - Synopsis|work=IMDb|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scene in the 2013 thriller ''[[The East (film)|The East]]'' draws strong comparisons to the allegory when protagonist Sarah is depicted as selfish for neglecting to feed her adjacent diner, whilst in a straitjacket. It is also retold in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s novel, ''[[The Bean Trees]]''.

In Scotland, it is often said "It taks a lang spoon tae sup wi a [[Fife|Fifer]]".

[[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] made an animation video based on this allegory for their campaign "One human family, food for all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://food.caritas.org/video-one-human-family-food-for-all/ Caritas's Video "One human family, food for all"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bocheonism''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 보천교 ''Bocheongyo'' or ''Pochonkyo'', "religion of the vault of heaven/firmament") was one among more than 100 [[new religious movements]] of [[Korea]] of the family of religions called [[Jeungsanism]], rooted in [[Korean shamanism]]&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and recognizing [[Gang Il-sun]] (Kang Jeungsan) as the incarnation of [[Sangje]], the Supreme God. It was founded by Cha Gyeong-seok (1880-1936) on Ibam Mountain in Daeheung-ri, Ibam-myeon, [[Jeongeup]], [[Jeollabuk-do]], in the year 1911. Today this site is part of [[Naejangsan]] National Park.
Cha Gyeong-seok was originally a [[Donghak]] ([[Cheondoist]]) priest, who converted to [[Jeungsanism]] after meeting [[Gang Il-Sun]]. After Gang's death, Goh Pan-Lye (Subu, literally “Head Lady,” 1880-1935, although in Kang's circle there was more than one "Subu"), a female disciple of Kang Jeungsan, around September 1911 gathered around her a number of Kang's followers. Cha Gyeong-seok was Goh’s male cousin and became the leader of Goh's branch. Dissatisfied with this situation, Goh separated from Cha in 1919 and established her own new religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Lee Kang-o, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch'' 43 (1967): 28-66; Massimo Introvigne, [https://wrldrels.org/2017/02/26/daesoon-jinrihoe "Daesoon Jinrihoe"], World Religions and Spiritualities Project, Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cha continued under the name Bocheon-gyo, which was adopted in 1921, at a great ritual held in [[Hamyang County]], [[Gyeongsangnam-do]].
Eventually, Bocheonism became the largest Korean new religious movement and possibly the largest religion in Korea, with some six million followers,&lt;ref&gt; Robert Pearson Flaherty, “Korean Millennial Movements,” in ''The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism'', edited by [[Catherine Wessinger]], Oxford: Oxford University Press 2016,{{ISBN|978-01-953010-5-2}}, 326-347 (335).&lt;/ref&gt; including leading activists in the [[Korean independence movements]]. Bocheonism, however, declined rapidly after Cha's death in 1936, and fragmented into several competing group, as did Goh's organization. The largest among these branches is [[Jeung San Do]].
Cha prophesied that the unification of the world would take place beginning in Korea. Branches of Bocheonism are also credited with encouraging local culture in the Jeongeup region, including the pungmulgut performance tradition.

Throughout history, various groups of people have considered themselves to be '''chosen people''' by a [[deity]] for a purpose, such as to act as the deity's agent on earth.{{cite-needed|date=April 2017}} In [[monotheistic]] faiths references to [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] are used in constructs such as "God's Chosen People". The phenomenon of a "chosen people" is particularly common in the
Israelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of [[groups claiming affiliation with Israelites|Israelite]] ancestry, as is the case for the [[Christian Identity]] and [[Black Hebrew]] sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the "true Israel". Others claim a "spiritual" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the [[People of God]].

[[Anthropologist]]s commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref name="HavilandPrins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A. Haviland|author2=Harald E. L. Prins|author3=Dana Walrath|author4=Bunny McBride|title=The Essence of Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmvJ1XtnIQoC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59981-4|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EitzenZinn2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Jews as the chosen people}}
In Judaism, "chosenness" is the belief that the [[Jew]]s, via descent from the ancient [[Israelites]], are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God in Judaism|God]]. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Ronald (1968). ''God's Chosen People: a Theological Interpretation of the Book of Deuteronomy''. In series, ''Religious Book Club'', 182. London: S.C.M. Press&lt;/ref&gt; as the verb ''bahar'' ({{native name|he|בָּחַ֣ר|italics=off}}), and is alluded to elsewhere in the [[Hebrew Bible]] using other terms such as "holy people".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nN8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews as a Chosen People: Tradition and Transformation, S. Leyla Gurkan]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Much is written about these topics in [[rabbinic literature]]. The three largest Jewish denominations—[[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]]—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the Torah.

===Mormonism===

In [[Mormonism]], all [[Latter Day Saint]]s are viewed as [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]], or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] of baptism. In contrast to [[supersessionism]], Latter Day Saints do not dispute the "chosen" status of the Jewish people.
Most practicing Mormons receive a [[patriarchal blessing]] that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through "adoption;" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the [[tribes of Israel]]). It is a widely held belief&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel H. Ludlow]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/01/of-the-house-of-israel "Of the House of Israel"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-seminary-student-study-guide/genesis-44  |title= Genesis 44&amp;nbsp;– Joseph Tests His Brothers |accessdate=|work=[http://www/lds.org/ lds.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}&lt;/ref&gt; that most members of the faith are in the [[tribe of Ephraim]] or the [[tribe of Manasseh]].

Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors{{which?|date=January 2017}} who regarded Europeans as the "chosen people" and Jews as the cursed offspring of [[Cain]]. [[White supremacist]] sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.

==Rastafari==
{{Main article| Rastafari}}
Based on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via [[Kebra Nagast]], Rastas believe that Israel's [[King Solomon]], together with Ethiopian [[Queen of Sheba]], conceived a child which began the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic line]] of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when [[Beta Israel]], Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during [[Operation Moses]] in 1985.

Founder [[Elijah Muhammad]] called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of [[Allah]] and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28668">'''Civil religion''', also referred to as a '''civic religion''',&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; is the implicit religious values of a nation, as expressed through public [[ritual]]s, symbols (such as the national flag), and ceremonies on sacred days and at sacred places (such as monuments, battlefields, or national cemeteries). It is distinct from churches, although church officials and ceremonies are sometimes incorporated into the practice of civil religion.{{sfn|Wimberley|Swatos|1998}} Countries described as having a civil religion include France,&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance/&gt; South Korea,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; and the former Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} As a concept, it originated in French [[political thought]] and became a major topic for U.S. [[sociologist]]s since its use by [[Robert Bellah]] in 1960.

==Origin of term==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] coined the term in chapter 8, book 4 of ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762), to describe what he regarded as the moral and spiritual foundation essential for any modern society. For Rousseau, civil religion was intended simply as a form of social cement, helping to unify the [[State (polity)|state]] by providing it with sacred authority. In his book, [[Rousseau]] outlines the simple [[dogma]]s of the civil religion:
# [[deity]]
# [[afterlife]]
# the reward of [[virtue]] and the punishment of [[vice]]
# the exclusion of [[religious intolerance]]{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1967 |2a1=Juergensmeyer |2y=2003 |2p=245 |3a1=Meyer-Dinkgrafe |3y=2004 |3p=30 |4a1=Shanks |4y=2000 |4p=29}}
The Italian historian [[Emilio Gentile]] has studied the roots and development of the concept and proposed a division of two types of religions of politics: a civil religion and a [[political religion]].{{sfn|Gentile|2006}}

==Sociology of religion==
[[File:National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington National Cathedral]] in [[Washington, DC]], is often used for state [[funeral]]s for political leaders.]]
In the [[sociology of religion]], '''civil religion''' is the [[folk religion]] of a [[nation]] or a [[politics|political]] [[culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Civil religion stands somewhat above folk religion in its social and political status, since by definition it suffuses an entire society, or at least a segment of a society; and is often practiced by [[leadership|leader]]s within that society.  On the other hand, it is somewhat less than an [[establishment of religion]], since established churches have official [[clergy]] and a relatively fixed and formal relationship with the government that establishes them. Civil religion is usually practiced by political leaders who are laypeople and whose leadership is not specifically spiritual.

===Examples===

Such civil religion encompasses such things as:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*the invocation of God in political speeches and public monuments;
*the quotation of [[religious text]]s on public occasions by political leaders;
*the veneration of past political leaders;
*the use of the lives of these leaders to teach moral ideals;
*the veneration of veterans and casualties of a nation's wars;
*religious gatherings called by political leaders;
*the use of religious symbols on public buildings;
*the use of public buildings for worship;
*[[founding myth]]s and other [[national myth]]s
and similar religious or quasi-religious practices.

==Practical political philosophy==
[[File:Arc De Triomphe 2004.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in [[Paris]] commemorates those who died in France's wars.]]

Professional commentators on political and social matters writing in newspapers and magazines sometimes use the term '''''civil religion''''' or '''''civic religion''''' to refer to [[ritual]] expressions of [[patriotism]] of a sort practiced in all countries, not always including religion in the conventional sense of the word.

Among such practices are the following:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*crowds singing the national anthem at certain public gatherings;
*parades or display of the national flag on certain [[National Day|patriotic holidays]];
*reciting [[oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]] (like the pledges of allegiance found in countries such as the [[Pledge of Allegiance (Bahamas)|Bahamas]], [[Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag|the Philippines]], and [[Pledge of Allegiance (South Korea)|South Korea]]);
*ceremonies concomitant to the inauguration of a president or the coronation of a monarch;
*retelling exaggerated, one-sided, and simplified [[mythology|mythologized]] tales of [[List of national founders|national founders]] and other great leaders or great events (e.g., battles, mass migrations) in the past (in this connection, see also [[romantic nationalism]]);
*[[monument]]s commemorating great leaders of the past or historic events;
*monuments to dead soldiers or annual ceremonies to remember them;
*expressions of [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the state, the predominant national racial/ethnic group,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; the national constitution, or the monarch;
*expressions of solidarity with people perceived as being national kindred but residing in a foreign country or a foreign country perceived as being similar enough to the nation to warrant admiration and/or loyalty;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*expressions of hatred towards another country or foreign ethnic group perceived as either currently being an enemy of the state and/or as having wronged and slighted the nation in the past;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*public display of the coffin of a recently deceased political leader.

==Relation between the two conceptions==

These two conceptions (sociological and political) of '''civil religion''' substantially overlap. In Britain, where church and state are constitutionally joined, the monarch's coronation is an elaborate religious rite celebrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In France, secular ceremonies are separated from religious observances to a greater degree than in most countries. In the United States, a president being inaugurated is told by the Constitution to choose between saying [[oath of office|"I do solemnly swear..."]] (customarily followed by "so help me God", although those words are not Constitutionally required) and saying "I do solemnly affirm..." (in which latter case no mention of God would be expected).

==History==

===Prehistory and classical antiquity===
{{Disputed section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg|thumb|The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], his [[capite velato|head ritually covered]], conducts a public sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter]]
Practically all the ancient and prehistoric reigns suffused politics with religion. Often the leaders, such as the [[Pharaoh]] or the [[Chinese Emperor]] were considered manifestations of a [[Divinity]]. Tribal world-view was often [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]], the tribe being an extension of its surrounding nature and the leaders having roles and symbols derived from the animal hierarchy and significant natural phenomena (such as storm).

The religion of the Athenian [[polis]] was a secular [[polytheism]] focused on the [[Olympian Gods]] and was celebrated in the civic festivals. Religion was a matter of state and the Athenian [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] deliberated on matters of religion. Atheism and the introduction of foreign gods were forbidden in Athens and punishable by death. For example, the Athenian ecclesia charged that [[Socrates]] worshiped gods other than those sanctioned by the polis and condemned him to death.

Rome also had a civil religion, whose first Emperor [[Augustus]] officially attempted to revive the dutiful practice of classical [[paganism]]. [[Religion in Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] were essentially local in character; the [[Roman Empire]] attempted to unite its disparate territories by inculcating an ideal of Roman piety, and by a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] identifying of the gods of conquered territories with the Greek and Roman [[Greek mythology|pantheon]].  In this campaign, Augustus erected monuments such as the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'', the Altar of Peace, showing the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and his family worshiping the gods.  He also encouraged the publication of works such as [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid|Æneid]]'', which depicted "pious [[Aeneas|Æneas]]", the [[legend]]ary ancestor of [[Rome]], as a role model for Roman religiosity. Roman historians such as [[Livy]] told tales of early Romans as morally improving stories of military prowess and civic virtue. The Roman civil religion later became centered on the person of the Emperor through the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], the worship of the ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of the Emperor.{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

===Rousseau and Durkheim===
The phrase ''civil religion'' was first discussed extensively by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his 1762 treatise ''The Social Contract''. Rousseau defined ''civil religion'' as a group of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an afterlife in which [[virtue]] is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in [[freedom of religion|religious tolerance]].  He said the dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries.{{sfn|Beiner|1993}} Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals' religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments.  For Rousseau civil religion was to be constructed and imposed from the top down as an artificial source of civic virtue.{{sfn|Demerath|Williams|1985}}

Wallace studies [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), the French sociologist who analysed civil religion, especially in comparative terms, and stressed that the public schools are critical in implementing civil religion. Although he never used the term he laid great stress on the concept.{{sfn|Wallace|1977}}

==Examples==
===France===
Secular states in Europe by the late 19th century were building civil religion based on their recent histories. In France's case, Baylac argues, the French government:
{{quote|encouraged a veritable state religion, worshiping the flag and multiplying the national holidays and commemorative monuments.&amp;nbsp;... July 14 became a national holiday in 1882; the centennial of the French Revolution was celebrated in 1889. In Italy, the secular state multiplied the celebrations: State holidays, King and Queen's birthdays, pilgrimage of 1884 to the tomb of Victor-Emmanuel II. A patriotic ideology was created.&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance&gt;{{cite book |last=Baylac |first=M.-H. |year=1997 |title=Histoire 1ère |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Bordas |page=134}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Lindaman|Ward|2013|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===South Korea===
In contemporary South Korea, the predominating civil religion has been described as consisting of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiment]] coupled with a pan-[[Korean racial nationalism]].&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; This has been criticized by some scholars as being detrimental to South Korean national security as it encourages North Korean provocations against the country in the guise that South Koreans will not adequately defend their country's security as they feel a certain racial and ethnic solidarity with North Korea.&lt;ref name=BRMyers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/war_college/what-north-korea-wants|title=What North Korea Wants|date=2017|first=Brian Reynolds|authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers|last=Myers|publisher=Soundcloud|work=Reuters War College|quote=The South needs to retire the conventional civic religion here, which is anti-Japanese pan-Korean nationalism in favor of a collective identification of civic principles.|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argued that South Korea should retire this sort of racialized civil religion for one more rooted in civic principles, like was found in [[West Germany]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;

===Soviet Union===
[[File:Dubna Lenin.JPG|thumb|Statue of Lenin at [[Dubna]], Russia, built in 1937; it is 25 metres tall]]
The Soviet Union made [[Marxism–Leninism]] into a civil religion, with sacred texts and [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|many statues of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.]]{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} Stalin personally supervised the cult of Lenin and his own cult, which took advantage of the historic semi-religious adulation Russian peasants had shown toward the tsars.{{sfn|Plamper|2012}} The Lenin icons were put into storage when [[fall of communism|communism fell in 1991]]. The [[List of statues of Stalin|Stalin statues]] had been [[de-Stalinization|removed]] in the 1950s and mention of him was erased from encyclopedias and history books. However under [[Vladimir Putin]] in the 21st century the memory of Stalin has been partly rehabilitated in search of a strong leader who made the nation powerful.  For example, school textbooks were rewritten to portray "the mass terror of the Stalin years as essential to the country's rapid modernization in the face of growing German and Japanese military threats, and amid the inaction or duplicity of the Western democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sherlock |first=Thomas |year=2011 |title=Confronting the Stalinist Past: The Politics of Memory in Russia |url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |magazine=The Washington Quarterly |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=97 |issn=1530-9177 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225034518/https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2018 |access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|American civil religion}}
Civil religion is an important component of public life in America, especially at the national level for its celebration of [[nationalism]]. Sociologists report that its "feast days" are [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], [[Veterans Day]], and [[Memorial Day]]. Its rituals include salutes to the flag and singing "[[God Bless America]]".{{sfn|Bruce|Yearley|2006|p=34}} Soldiers and veterans play a central role of standing ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. Bellah noted the veneration of veterans.{{sfn|Bellah|1992}} The historian Conrad Cherry called the Memorial Day ceremonies "a modern cult of the dead" and says that it "affirms the civil religious tenets."{{sfn|Wilsey|2015|p=24}}

====American Revolution====
{{Further|Commemoration of the American Revolution}}
The American Revolution was the main source of the civil religion that has shaped patriotism ever since. According to the sociologist Robert Bellah:
{{quote|Behind the civil religion at every point lie biblical archetypes: Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and Sacrificial Death and Rebirth. But it is also genuinely American and genuinely new. It has its own prophets and its own martyrs, its own sacred events and sacred places, its own solemn rituals and symbols. It is concerned that America be a society as perfectly in accord with the will of God as men can make it, and a light to all nations.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}}}

Albanese argues that the American Revolution was the main source of the non-denominational [[American civil religion]] that has shaped patriotism and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Tom Paine]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]], [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]), rituals ([[Boston Tea Party]]), emblems ([[American flag|the new flag]]), sacred holidays ([[July 4]]) and a holy scripture whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied in current law cases (the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]).{{sfn|Albanese|1977}}

Although "God" is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], mention is specifically made of "[[Deism#Deism in the United States|Nature's God]]" in the opening sentence of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

====Historiography====
[[File:Christian Flag etc Covenant Presbyterian Long Beach 20050213.jpg|thumb|The [[Christian flag]] displayed alongside the flag of the United States next to the pulpit in a church in California.  Note the eagle and cross finials on the flag poles.]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as [[Robert N. Bellah]] and [[Martin E. Marty]] studied civil religion as a cultural phenomenon, attempting to identify the actual tenets of civil religion in the United States, or to study civil religion as a phenomenon of [[cultural anthropology]].  Within this American context, Marty wrote that Americans approved of "religion in general" without being particularly concerned about the content of that faith, and attempted to distinguish "priestly" and "prophetic" roles within the practice of American civil religion, which he preferred to call the ''public theology''.{{sfn|Marty|1989|p=295}} In the 1967 essay "Civil Religion in America", Bellah wrote that civil religion in its priestly sense is "an institutionalized collection of sacred beliefs about the American nation."  Bellah describes the prophetic role of civil religion as challenging "national self-worship" and calling for "the subordination of the nation to ethical principles that transcend it in terms of which it should be judged."{{sfn|Bellah|1967}} Bellah identified the [[American Revolution]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as three decisive historical events that impacted the content and imagery of civil religion in the United States.

The application of the concept of civil religion to the United States was in large part the work of sociologist [[Robert Bellah]]. He identified an elaborate system of practices and beliefs arising from America's unique historic experience and religiosity. Civil religion in the US was originally Protestant but brought in Catholics and Jews after World War II. Having no association with any religious sect, Civil religion was used in the 1960s to justify civil rights legislation. Americans ever since the colonial era talk of their obligation both collective and individual to carry out God's will on earth. [[George Washington]] was a sort of high priest, and the documents of the [[Founding Fathers]] have been treated as almost sacred texts. With the Civil War, says Bellah, came a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth, as expressed through [[Memorial Day]] rituals. Unlike France, the American civil religion was never anticlerical or militantly secular.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}

==Current issues==
This assertive civil religion of the United States is an occasional cause of political friction between the US and Europe, where the literally religious form of civil religion has largely faded away in recent decades. In the United States, civil religion is often invoked under the name of "[[Judeo-Christian ethics]]", a phrase originally intended to be maximally inclusive of the several religions practiced in the United States, assuming that these faiths all share the same values. Alvin J. Schmidt argues that since the 1700s, expressions of civil religion in the United States have shifted from a deistic to a polytheistic stance.{{sfn|Schmidt|2004}}

Some scholars have argued that the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] can be seen as a main [[totem]] of a national cult,&lt;ref&gt;Marvin and Ingle (1996). [http://www.asc.upenn.edu/USR/fcm/jaar.htm "Blood Sacrifice and the Nation: Revisiting Civil Religion"].&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that modern punishment is a form of civil religion.{{sfn|SpearIt|2013}} Arguing against mob violence and lynching, Abraham Lincoln declared in his 1838 Lyceum speech that the Constitution and the laws of the United States ought to become the "political religion" of each American.&lt;ref&gt;Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois January 27, 1838 [http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criticism of Judaism}}
{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}
'''Criticism of Judaism''' refers to criticism of [[Jewish]] [[Judaism|religious doctrines]], [[Jewish literature|texts]], [[Jewish laws|laws]] and [[Jewish culture|practices]].  Early criticism originated in inter-faith polemics between [[Christianity]] and Judaism.  Important [[disputations]] in the Middle Ages gave rise to widely publicized criticisms. Modern criticisms also reflect the inter-branch [[Jewish schisms]] between [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], and [[Reform Judaism]].

==Inter-branch criticisms==

===Criticism of Conservative Judaism from other branches===
{{Main|Criticism of Conservative Judaism}}
Conservative Judaism is criticized by some leaders of [[Orthodox Judaism]] for not properly following [[Halakha]] (Jewish religious law).&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shafran]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060106063953/http://www.momentmag.com/archive/feb01/feat2.html "The Conservative Lie"], ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also criticized by some leaders of [[Reform Judaism]] for being at odds with the principles of its young adult members on issues such as [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]], [[Patrilineality|patrilineal descent]], and the ordination of homosexuals — all issues that Conservative Judaism opposes and Reform Judaism supports.&lt;ref name="Berkofsky"&gt;Joe Berkofsky, [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21714/edition_id/441/format/html/displaystory.html "Death of Conservative Judaism? Reform leader’s swipe sparks angry rebuttals"], ''[[j.]]'', March 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Conservative movement has since moved in the direction of allowing for gay rabbis and the ''"celebration of same-sex commitment ceremonies."''&lt;ref name="gay rabbis"&gt;Laurie Goodstein,

===Criticism of traditional Judaism by reform movement===
{{See also|Reform movement in Judaism|Jewish schisms|Jewish Enlightenment}}
The [[Reform movement in Judaism|reform movement]] grew out of dissatisfaction with several aspects of [[Orthodox Judaism|traditional Judaism]] or [[Rabbinic Judaism]], as documented in [[polemics]] and other 19th- and early-20th-century writings.&lt;ref name="shmueli"&gt;Shmueli, Efraim (1990) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uaU4NEWSvlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Seven+Jewish%22+shmueli&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1VkpTL-PAsWisQaW7MTEBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Seven Jewish cultures: a reinterpretation of Jewish history and thought]''  Cambridge University Press, p. 123, 167-168, 172-174, 177, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Jacobs]], a prominent Masorti Rabbi, described the polemics between the Orthodox and the Reform movements as follows: {{quote|text="The polemics between Orthodox, as the traditionalists came to be called, and the Reformers were fierce.  The Orthodox treated Reform as rank heresy, as no more than a religion of convenience which, if followed, would lead Jews altogether out of Judaism.   The Reformers retorted that, on the contrary, the danger to Jewish survival was occasioned by the Orthodox who, through their obscurantism, failed to see that the new challenges facing Judaism had to be faced consciously in the present as Judaism had faced, albeit unconsciously, similar challenges in the past." |sign=Louis Jacobs|source=''The Jewish religion: a companion'', Oxford University Press, p. 4. (1995)}}
[[David Einhorn (rabbi)|David Einhorn]], an American Reform rabbi, calls Reform Judaism a "liberation" of Judaism : {{quote|text="There is at present a rent in Judaism which affects its very life, and which no covering, however glittering, can repair. The evil which threatens to corrode gradually all the healthy bone and marrow must be completely eradicated, and this can be done only if, in the name and in the interest of the religion, we remove from the sphere of our religious life all that is corrupt and untenable, and solemnly absolve ourselves from all obligations toward it in the future; thus we may achieve the liberation of Judaism for ourselves and for our children, so as to prevent the estrangement from Judaism."|sign=David Einhorn|source=Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'', Macmillan.}}

The criticisms of traditional Judaism included criticisms asserting that the Torah's laws are not strictly binding;&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Abraham Geiger ... stressed the belief in progress: the Bible and Talmud represent an early, primitive stage in a revelation that is still continuing.  Many traditional ceremonies (such as circumcision) are distressing to modern sensibility or incompatible with modern life... Geiger become increasingly convinced of the need to 'dethrone the Talmud'... " -  De Lange, Nicholas (2000),''An introduction to Judaism'',  Cambridge University Press,  p. 73
*"According to [Mordecai] Kaplan, the Jewish heritage, including the belief in God, must be reinterpreted so that it will be consistent with the intellectual outlook of the twentieth century. The Torah, which is Jewish civilization in practice, must be given a new functional interpretation." - Scult, Mel (1993) ''Judaism faces the twentieth century: a biography of Mordecai M. Kaplan'', Wayne State University Press, p. 341.
*"Israel drew within herself, shunned the world, and lived apart. In her seclusion her  religion became her all.  The interpretation of the Law and the construction put upon the commandments tended toward the upholding of the letter rather than the spirit. ... Reform was born to protect the spirit of the Law, to place the spirit above the letter, to make the latter subservient to the former.... The abolition of those forms and ceremonies that were not conducive to proper living, or that had, by reason of altered environment, become meaningless, was of the highest importance to the spiritual welfare of Israel." - Stern, Myer (1895), ''The rise and progress of reform Judaism: '', Harvard University, p. 5.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that many ceremonies and rituals are not necessary;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Reform Judaism rejected the concept of Divine revelation, and ... the law is considered instructional and inspirational but not binding, ... and by eliminating many ritual practices..." -  Dosick, Wayne D. (1995), ''Living Judaism: the complete guide to Jewish belief, tradition, and practice'', HarperCollins, p. 62.
*"Reform Judaism first took hold in Germany in the early nineteenth century.  This tradition asserts that many of the ritualistic practices and dogmas of the past are outmoded..... Reform Jews assumed a prerogative to choose which Biblical laws were worthy of their allegiance and which were not.... Orthodox Jews adhere to a literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible and continue to observe all the traditional Jewish laws... Conservative Jews ... were ... less likely than the Orthodox to accept the infallibility of sacred texts asserting that 'the divine origin of Jewish law ... [was subject] to human development and application'". - Berger, Ronald J. (2002), ''Fathoming the Holocaust: a social problems approach'', Aldine Transaction, p. 179-180.
*"We hold that all such Mosaic and rabbinical laws as regulate diet, priestly purity, and dress originated in ages and under the influence of ideas entirely foreign to our present mental and spiritual state. They fail to impress the modern Jew with a spirit of priestly holiness; their observance in our days is apt rather to obstruct than to further modern spiritual elevation." - [[Pittsburgh Platform]], section 4.
*"...in the view of rabbinical Judaism every command of the written law in the Pentateuch (Torah sh'bikthab), and of the oral law (Torah sh'b'al peh), as codified in the Shulchan Aruk, is equally binding. The ceremonial law has equal potency with the religious and moral commands. Reform Judaism, on the other hand, claims that a distinction must be made between the universal precepts of religion and morality and the enactments arising from the circumstances and conditions of special times and places. Customs and ceremonies must change with the varying needs of different generations. Successive ages have their individual requirements for the satisfaction of the religious nature. No ceremonial law can be eternally binding. " -  Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Macmillan (reprinted by University of California, 2007), p. 5-6.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that Rabbinical leadership is too authoritarian;&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
*".. the immense authoritarian power of the orthodox Rabbis and Hasidic Zadikkim in the traditionalist communities ... As a result, there was open conflict between the rebellious youth .. and the religious establishment.... This was the context in which a virulent 'anti-clericalism' developed among progressive Jewish intellectuals, leaving countless evidence in the shape of polemical articles, autobiographical works, and imaginative literature." - Lowy, Michael (1992), ''Redemption and utopia: Jewish libertarian thought in Central Europe : a study in elective affinity'', Stanford University Press, p. 45.
*"[Reform Judaism was] founded as a response by Jewish laity to the perceived authoritarian rigidity of traditional or Orthodox Judaism and its rabbis." - Palmer-Fernández, Gabriel (2004), ''The encyclopedia of religion and war'', Routledge,  p. 253.
*"Mosaism and rabbinic Judaism were appropriate for earlier ages, [Kohler] argued.  But the age of man's maturity called for freedom from the letter, from blind authority, 'from all restriction which curb the minds and encroach upon the hearts'.  The contemporary Jew had 'outgrown the guiding strings ... of infancy'; he was ready to walk on his own.  What he required was not law, but a 'living Judaism', both enlightened and pious, appealing to reason and emotion." - Meyer, Michael A. (1995)  ''Response to modernity: a history of the Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Wayne State University Press, p. 267.
*"There is a fatal split among Jews, first, because religious tenets and institutions have been kept forcibly on a level of a vanished era, and not permeated with the divine breath of refreshing life, while life itself hurried forward stormily; and secondly, because the religious leaders, lacking all knowledge of the world and of men, dreamed of other times and conditions, and held themselves aloof from the life of the new generation - hence resulted a superficial rationalism, inimical to all positive and historical faith, side by side with a rigid, unreasoning formalism". -  Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Macmillan (reprinted by University of California, 2007), (quoting Abraham Kohn, rabbi of Hohemems in Tirol); p. 93-95.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that there was too much superstition;  criticisms asserting that traditional Judaism leads to isolation from other communities;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Emancipation implied the breakdown of the Jews' millennial social and cultural isolation ... It was said for the first time in European history the Jews could participate in non-Jewish culture without the stigma of apostacy". {{cite book

|first=Paul R. |last=Mendes-Flohr
|publisher=Oxford University Press US,
|year=1995
|isbn=019507453X|page=155
}}

*"Sociologically, the way of life of halakhic Judaism vouchsafed Jewry to an unambiguously distinct ... identity - an identity that was the source of a profound discomfort to those Jews who sought cultural, social, and political integration in the Gentile community in which they lived." - ''The Jew in the modern world: a documentary history'' Paul R. Mendes-Flohr (Ed.),  p. 156
&lt;/ref&gt; and criticisms asserting that traditional Judaism over-emphasized the exile.&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
*" We recognize, in the modern era of universal culture of heart and intellect, the approaching of the realization of Israels great Messianic hope for the establishment of the kingdom of truth, justice, and peace among all men. We consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious community, and therefore expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron, nor the restoration of any of the laws concerning the Jewish state." - [[Pittsburgh Platform]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these criticisms were anticipated in a much earlier time, by philosopher [[Uriel da Costa]] (1585–1640) who criticized the Rabbinic authorities and the Talmud for lack of authenticity and spirituality.&lt;ref name="Spinozalife"/&gt;

==Criticism from Christianity==
{{See also|Supersessionism|Marcionism|Christian anti-Judaism}}

===Paul's criticism of Judaism===
{{main|New Perspective on Paul|Paul the Apostle and Judaism|Pauline Christianity}}
[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] criticizes Jews for their failure to believe that [[Jesus]] was the [[Messiah]] (Romans 9:30–10:13) and for their view about their favored status and lack of equality with [[gentiles]] (Roman 3:27).&lt;ref&gt;[[E. P. Sanders]], Paul the Law and Jewish People,  Fortress Press, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; In Romans 7–12, one criticism of Judaism made by Paul is that it is a religion based in law instead of faith. In many interpretations of this criticism made prior to the mid 20th century, Judaism was held to be fundamentally flawed by the sin of self-righteousness.&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; The issue is complicated by differences in the versions of Judaism extant at the time. Some scholars argue that Paul's criticism of Judaism are correct, others suggest that Paul's criticism is directed at [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic]] Judaism, the forms with which Paul was most familiar,&lt;ref name="sanders_1977"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the question as to whom Paul was addressing. Paul saw himself as an apostle to the Gentiles, and it is unclear as to whether the text of Romans was directed to Jewish followers of Jesus (as was Paul), to Gentiles, or to both.&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; If adherence to Jewish law were a requirement for salvation, then salvation would be denied to Gentiles without a conversion to Judaism.&lt;ref name="sanders_1983"/&gt; Krister Stendahl argues along similar lines that according to Paul, Judaism's rejection of Jesus as a savior is what allows salvation of non-Jews, that this rejection is part of God's overall plan, and that Israel will also be saved (per [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A26-27&amp;version=KJV Romans 11:26–27]).&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"&gt;

Some scholars argue that the fundamental issue underlying Paul's criticism of Judaism hinges on his understanding of Judaism's relationship to Jewish law. E. P. Sanders, for example, argues that the view held by many New Testament scholars from Weber on,&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; represent a caricature of Judaism and that this interpretation of Paul's criticism is thus flawed by the misunderstanding of the tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref name="gorman_2004"&gt;

===Regarding the death of Jesus===
{{Main|Jewish deicide|Antisemitic canard}}
The idea that Judaism, and the Jewish people collectively, are responsible for the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Jesus]], often represented in the claim that "Jews killed Jesus", figures prominently in anti-Semitic writings. It was initially stated by [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in the [[New Testament]] ({{bibleverse|1|Thes.|2:14-15|49}}).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic church]] formally disavowed its long complicity in anti-Semitism by issuing a [[Nostra Aetate|proclamation]] in 1965 repudiating the notion  that the Jewish people bore any guilt for Jesus's death.

==Criticism from Islam==
A prominent place in the [[Qur'an]]ic polemic against the Jews is given to the conception of the religion of [[Abraham]]. The Qur'an presents Muslims as neither Jews nor Christians but followers of Abraham who was in a physical sense the father of the Jews and the Arabs and lived before the revelation of [[Torah]]. In order to show that the religion practiced by the Jews is not the pure religion of Abraham, the Qur'an mentions the incident of worshiping of the calf, argues that Jews do not believe in part of the revelation given to them, and that their taking of usury shows their worldliness and disobedience of God. Furthermore, the Quran claims they attribute to God what he has not revealed. According to the [[Qur'an]], the Jews exalted a figure named [[Uzair]] as the "son of God" (see the [[Uzair#Quranic statements about perceived Jewish exaltation|Quranic statements about perceived Jewish exaltation]]). The character of [[Ezra]], who was presumed to be the figure mentioned by the Qur'an (albeit with no corroborative evidence to suggest Ezra and Uzair to be the same person) became important in the works of the later Andalusian Muslim scholar [[Ibn Hazm]], who explicitly accused Ezra of being a liar and a heretic who falsified and added interpolations into the Biblical text. In his polemic against Judaism, Ibn Hazm provided a list of what he said were chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; theological impossibilities (anthropomorphic expressions, stories of fornication and whoredom, and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as lack of reliable transmission ([[tawatur]]) of the text.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, Uzayr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI-Tahrif"&gt;Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, ''Tahrif'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; Heribert Busse writes "The only explanation is the presumption that Muhammad, in the heat of debate, wanted to accuse the Jews of heretical doctrine on a par with the heresy of the Christian doctrine that teaches the divine nature of Jesus. In doing so, he could take advantage of the high esteem granted Ezra in Judaism."&lt;ref name=Busse1998p57&gt;Busse, Heribert. ''Islam, Judaism, and Christianity: theological and historical affiliations'', Princeton series on the Middle East, Markus Wiener Publishers, 1998, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical criticism==

Philosophical criticism of Judaism is either part of [[criticism of religion|religious criticism]] in general, or specifically focused on aspects unique to the Jewish religion. [[Immanuel Kant]] is an example of the latter. Kant believed that Judaism fails to "satisfy the essential criteria of [a] religion" by requiring external obedience to moral laws, having a secular focus, and lacking a concern for [[Afterlife#Judaism|immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10705.html|title=Kant, Immanuel|author=[[Manfred H. Vogel]] |publisher=Virtual Jewish Library|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==

===Shechitah (Kosher slaughter)===
[[Shechita|Kosher slaughter]] has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary,&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland&gt;{{Cite book|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Emanuel|last=Melzer|pages=81–90|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as an [[antisemitic canard]] that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration,&lt;ref name=Poliakov&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Anti-semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w39m4aohL9gC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Léon|last=Poliakov|page=153|year=1968|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry.&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland/&gt; Sometimes, however, these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion.

More recently, kosher slaughter has attracted criticism from some groups concerned with [[animal welfare]], who contend that the absence of any form of [[anesthesia]] or stunning prior to the severance of the animal's [[jugular vein]] causes unnecessary pain and suffering. Calls for the abolition of kosher slaughter have been made in 2008 by Germany's federal chamber of veterinarians,&lt;ref name=Germany-Kosher&gt;

All the more did the law-observing Jews defy the edict of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons.";&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodges2001&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick, M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = The Bulletin of the History of Medicine| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-07-24| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Empire]], circumcision was regarded as a barbaric and disgusting custom.

A '''declaration of faith''' is a phrase that is said by a member of any [[religion]] to show either to themselves, their [[God]] or other members of the religion their belief and faith in the religion. Notable declarations of faith include the [[Sign of the Cross]] in [[Christianity]], the [[Shahadah]] in [[Islam]] and the [[Shema Yisrael]] in [[Judaism]].

There are numerous other declarations of faith, typically performed during religious rituals in many faiths. Often, the declaration of faith is led by the leader of the congregation and followers respond in kind.

'''Deconsecration''' is the act of removing a religious blessing from something that had been previously [[consecration|consecrated]] by a minister or priest of that religion. The practice is usually performed on churches to be rendered to non-religious ([[secular]]) use or demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1876/11/03/archives/deconsecration-of-a-london-church.html |title=Deconsecration of a London Church |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 1876 |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disputationes''''' (full title: '''''[[Disputation|Disputationes]] de Controversiis Christianae Fidei adversus hujus temporis Haereticos'''''{{Pronunciation needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt;, also referred to as '''''De Controversiis''''') is a work on dogmatics by [[Robert Bellarmine]]. It has been described as "the definitive defence of papal power".&lt;ref name="THCB"&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After its publication, Bellarmine was regarded as Rome's foremost apologist on doctrine and [[Papacy|papal power]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written while Bellarmine was lecturing at the [[Roman College]], and was first published at [[Ingolstadt]] in three volumes (1581, 1582, 1593)&lt;ref name="THCB"/&gt; or four.&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterliness.com/a/Robert.Bellarmine.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726143537/http://www.masterliness.com/a/Robert.Bellarmine.htm |archivedate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various controversies of the time, and made an immense impression throughout Europe, the strength of its arguments against [[Protestantism]] so acutely felt in Germany and England that special chairs were founded in order to provide replies to it.&lt;ref name = "CC"&gt;http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/r/robert_francis_romulus_bellarmine,saint.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]],&lt;ref name="THCB"/&gt; [[Theodore Beza]]&lt;ref name="THCB516"&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 516.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rainolds]]&lt;ref name="THCB516"/&gt; were among those who wrote counter-arguments against the work.

The first volume treats of the [[Word of God (Bible)|Word of God]], of [[Christ]], and of the [[pope]]; the second of the authority of [[ecumenical council]]s, and of the [[Church (Christian)|Church]], whether militant, suffering, or triumphant; the third of the [[sacrament]]s; and the fourth of [[Divine grace]], [[free will]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and [[good works]].&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt;

As much as Protestants disliked Bellarmine's theories, he was in fact moderate in his defence of papal power. In 1590, [[Pope Sixtus V]] had, or very nearly had,&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycatholic.org/issue/2003Sep/sep14doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the first volume placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] for denying temporal hegemony to the papacy. Bellarmine's reasoning was that though the pope is the vicar of Christ, since Christ did not ''exercise'' his [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]], nor may the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 516-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important part of the work is contained in the five books regarding the pope. In these, after a speculative introduction on forms of [[government]] in general, holding [[monarchy]] to be relatively the best, Bellarmine says that a monarchical government and the related temporal power are necessary for the Church, to preserve unity and order in it.

Such power Bellarmine considers to have been established by the commission of Christ to [[Saint Peter]]. He then proceeds to demonstrate that this power has been transmitted to the successors of Peter, admitting that a heretical pope may be freely judged and deposed by the Church since by the very fact of his [[Christian heresy|heresy]] he would cease to be pope, or even a member of the Church.

The third section discusses the [[Antichrist]]. Bellarmine gives in full the theory set forth by the [[Church Fathers]], of a personal Antichrist to come just before the end of the world and to be accepted by the [[Jew]]s and enthroned in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]—thus endeavoring to dispose of the Protestant exposition which saw in the pope the Antichrist.

The fourth section sets forth the pope as the supreme judge in matters of faith and morals, though making the concessions that the pope may err in questions of fact which may be known by ordinary human knowledge, and also when he speaks as a mere unofficial theologian. Bellarmine took in particular the example of [[Pope Honorius I]], who had been anathemized by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] as holding to [[monothelitism]]. He claimed that although monothelitism had been rightly condemned, Honorius was however orthodox as he had not really held these views, and that papal authority did not extend itself to the factual interpretation of what was to be found in Honorius or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pascal/blaise/p27pr/part17.html 17th Letter] of the [[Provincial Letters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth-centered religion or [[nature worship]] is a system of religion based on the veneration of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/406588/nature-worship Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers any [[religion]] that [[worship]]s the [[earth]], [[nature]], or [[fertility deity]], such as the various forms of [[Mother Goddess|goddess worship]] or [[matriarchal religion]]. Some find a connection between earth-worship and the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. Earth religions are also formulated to allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the earth.

==Origins==
[[File:Annarbor tree.jpg|thumb]]

===Origin claims by earth religion sources===
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Old Europe (archaeology)|pre-Indo-European]] societies lived in small-scale, family-based communities that practiced [[matrilineal succession]] and goddess-centered religion&lt;ref name="From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2002 |last=French |first=Marilyn |title=From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyr9pwbqeqoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Slavic+matrilinear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iftdUb2HOoq-8AToy4G4BA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Slavic%20matrilinear&amp;f=false |publisher=McArthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; where creation comes from the woman. She is the Divine Mother who can give life and take it away. In [[Irish mythology]] she is [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], in [[Slavic mythology]] she is [[Mat Zemlya]], and in other cultures she is [[Pachamama]], [[Ninsun]], [[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]], [[Nüwa]], [[Matres and Matrones|Matres]] or [[Shakti]].

In the late 1800s, [[James Weir (1856-1906)|James Weir]] wrote an article describing the beginnings and aspects of early religious feeling. According to Boyer, early man was forced to locate food and shelter in order to survive, while constantly being directed by his instincts and senses. Because man's existence depended on nature, men began to form their religion and beliefs on and around nature itself. It is evident that man's first religion would have had to develop from the material world, he argues, because man relied heavily on his senses and what he could see, touch, and feel. In this sense, the [[nature worship|worship of nature]] formed, allowing man to further depend on nature for survival.&lt;ref name="Lust and Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weir|first=James|title=Lust and Religion|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26071/26071-h/26071-h.htm|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|format=EBook|date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopagans]] have tried to make claims that religion started in ways that correspond to earth religion. In one of their published works, ''The Urantia Book'',  another reason for this worship of nature came from a fear of the world around primitive man.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2" /&gt;  His mind lacked the complex function of processing and sifting through complex ideas. As a result, man worshiped the very entity that surrounded him every day. That entity was nature. Man experienced the different natural phenomena around him, such as storms, vast deserts, and immense mountains. Among the very first parts of nature to be worshiped were rocks and hills, plants and trees, animals, the elements, heavenly bodies, and even man himself. As primitive man worked his way through nature worship, he eventually moved on to incorporate spirits into his worship.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright Morning Star|title=The Urantia Book|year=2005|publisher=Uversa Press|location=New York|isbn=0965197220|pages=805–810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MfMsljJW3gC&amp;pg=PA806&amp;lpg=PA806&amp;dq=%22The+objects+of+worship+were+altogether+suggestive;+they+consisted+of+the+things+of+nature+which+were+close+at+hand,+or+which+loomed+large+in+the+commonplace+experience+of+the+simple-minded+primitive+Urantians%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IqLZ2C00XB&amp;sig=b8eFU33wB5hl6ekR_BZSjG3rpro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5ZIUZiOLsWTyQHrnoCQBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20objects%20of%20worship%20were%20altogether%20suggestive%3B%20they%20consisted%20of%20the%20things%20of%20nature%20which%20were%20close%20at%20hand%2C%20or%20which%20loomed%20large%20in%20the%20commonplace%20experience%20of%20the%20simple-minded%20primitive%20Urantians%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these claims may have some merit, they are nonetheless presented from a biased position that cannot be authenticated by traditional and reliable sources. Therefore, their claims can not be relied upon.

===Origins of religion===
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

The origins of religion can be looked at through the lens of the function and processing of the human mind. [[Pascal Boyer]] suggests that, for the longest period of time, the brain was thought of as a simple organ of the body. However, he claims that the more information collected about the brain indicates that the brain is indeed not a "blank slate."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained|year=2001|publisher=A Member of the Perseus Book club|location=New Work|isbn=0465006965|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans do not just learn any information from the environment and surroundings around them. They have acquired sophisticated cognitive equipment that prepares them to analyze information in their culture and determine which information is relevant and how to apply it. Boyer states that "having a normal human brain does not imply that you have religion. All it implies is that people can acquire it, which is very different."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; He suggests that religions started for the reasons of providing answers to humans, giving comfort, providing social order to society, and satisfying the need of the illusion-prone nature of the human mind.&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; Ultimately, religion came into existence because of our need to answer questions and hold together our societal order.

An additional idea on the origins of religion comes not from man's cognitive development, but from the ape. Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from apes. The closest relative to the human species is the African ape.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Barbara J.|title=Evolving God: A Provocative View of the Origins of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Doubleday Religion|location=New York|isbn=0385521553}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Mar 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At birth, the ape begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. The world the ape is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in the ape's life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of [[belongingness]], which is derived from its dependence on the ape's mother and family. Belongingness is defined as "mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;  This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the [[hominidae|hominid]] (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of the ape, which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

As severe changes in the environment, physical evolutions in the human body (especially in the development of the human brain), and changes in social actions occurred, humans went beyond trying to simply form bonds and relationships of empathy with others. As their culture and society became more complex, they began using practices and various symbols to make sense of the natural and spiritual world around them. Instead of simply trying to find belongingness and empathy from the relationships with others, humans created and evolved God and spirits in order to fulfil that need and exploration. King argued that "an earthly need for belonging led to human religious imagination and thus to the otherworldly realm of relating to God, gods, and spirits."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

==Encompassed religions==
The term ''earth religion'' encompasses any religion that worships the earth, nature or fertility gods or goddesses. There is an array of groups and beliefs that fall under earth religion, such as [[paganism]], which is a polytheistic, nature based religion; [[animism]], which is the worldview that all living entities (plants, animals, and humans) possess a spirit; [[Wicca]], who hold the concept of an earth mother goddess as well as practice ritual magic; and [[druidism]], which equates divinity with the natural world.

Another perspective of earth religion to consider is [[pantheism]], which takes a varied approach to the importance and purpose of the earth, and man's relationship with the planet. Several of their core statements deal with the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that "all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part" and "we are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WPM Statement of Principles|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheism|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth also plays a vital role to many Voltaic peoples, many of whom "consider the Earth to be Heaven’s wife",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimoń|first=Henryk|title=The Sacredness of the Earth Among the Konkomba of Northern Ghana|journal=Anthropos|year=2003|volume=98|issue=2|pages=421–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Konkomba]] of northern Ghana, whose economic, social and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. It is also important to consider various Native American religions, such as [[Peyote Religion]], [[Longhouse Religion]], and Earth Lodge Religion.

==Around the world==
April 22 was established as [[International Mother Earth Day]] by the [[United Nations]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10823.doc.htm |title=General Assembly Proclaims 22 April 'International Mother Earth Day' Adopting By Consensus Bolivia-Led Resolution |publisher=United Nations |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many cultures around the world have been celebrating the Earth for thousands of years. [[Winter solstice]] and [[Summer solstice]] are celebrated with holidays like [[Yule]] and [[Dongzhi Festival|Dongzhi]] in the winter and [[Tiregān]] and [[Kupala]] in the summer.

===Africa===
[[Animism]] is practiced among the [[Bantu peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rGpO_TzeCsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=nature+worship+in+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XENeUaTVH4ym9gT0uIH4AQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nature%20worship%20animism&amp;f=false |title=African Traditional Religion in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography p 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The [[Dahomey mythology]] has deities like [[Nana Buluku]], [[Gleti]], [[Mawu]],     [[Asase Yaa]], [[Naa Nyonmo]] and [[Xevioso]].

===Europe===
In [[Baltic mythology]], the sun is a female deity, [[Saulė|Saule]], a mother or a bride, and [[Mēness]] is the moon, father or husband, their children being the stars. In [[Slavic mythology]] [[Mokosh]] and [[Mat Zemlya]] together with [[Perun]] head up the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Celebrations and rituals are centered on nature and harvest seasons. [[Dragobete]] is a traditional [[Romanians|Romanian]] spring holiday that celebrates "the day when the birds are betrothed."

===India===
In [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[yoni]] is the creative power of nature and the [[origin of life]]. In [[Shaktism]], the yoni is celebrated and worshipped during the [[Ambubachi Mela]], an annual fertility festival which celebrates the Earth's [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|title=Celebrating The Divine Female Principle|last=Chawla|first=Janet|date=September 16, 2002|publisher=Boloji.com|accessdate=24 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100131031243/http://boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm| archivedate= 31 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Although the idea of earth religion has been around for thousands of years, it did not fully show up in popular culture until the early 1990s. ''[[The X-Files]]'' was one of the first nationally broadcast television programs to air [[witchcraft]] and [[Wicca]] (types of earth religion) content. On average, Wiccans - those who practice Wicca - were more or less pleased with the way the show had portrayed their ideals and beliefs. However, they still found it to be a little "sensationalistic". That same year, the movie ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' was released - also depicting the art of Wicca. Unfortunately, this cinematic feature was not as happily accepted as ''The X-Files'' had been.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Juggler|url=http://culture.pagannewswirecollective.com/2010/08/a-time-line-of-wiccan-pop-culture/|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, programs showcasing the aforementioned religious practices - such as ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' - became widely popular. Although ''Charmed'' focused mostly on witchcraft, the magic they practiced very closely resembled Wicca. Meanwhile, ''Buffy'' was one of the first shows to actually cast a Wiccan character. However, since the shows focus was primarily on [[Vampire|vampires]], the Wiccan was depicted as having supernatural powers, rather than being in-tuned with the Earth.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"/&gt;

Other movies and shows throughout the last few decades have also been placed under the genre of Earth Religion. Among them are two of director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s most well known films - ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. Both movies present human interaction with land, animal, and other nature spirits. Speakers for Earth Religion have said that these interactions suggest overtones of Earth Religion themes.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"&gt;{{cite web|last=krasskova|title=My Top 10 Pagan/Heathen Movies|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/11/my-top-10-paganheathen-movies/|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular Disney movies have also been viewed as Earth Religion films. Among them are ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]''. Those who practice Earth Religion view ''The Lion King'' as an Earth Religion film mainly for the "interconnectedness" and "Circle of Life" it shows between the animals, plants, and life in general. When that link is broken, viewers see chaos and despair spread throughout the once bountiful land. Congruently, ''Brother Bear'' portrays interactions and consequences when humans disobey or go against the animal and Earth spirits.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

Other earth religion movies include ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'', ''[[The Deceivers (film)]]'', ''[[Sorceress (1982 film)]]'', ''[[Anchoress (film)]]'', ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'', ''[[Agora (film)]]'', and ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)]]''. These movies all contain various aspects of earth religion and nature worship in general.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
[[File:Emirgan 04589.jpg|thumb]]

===Hindrance of progress===
Many religions have negative stereotypes of earth religion and neo-paganism in general. A common critique of the worship of nature and resources of "Mother Earth" is that the rights of nature and [[ecocide]] movements are inhibitors of human progress and development.&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley|title=Ecocide is Earth Religion|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/322526/ecocide-earth-religion|work=Human Exceptionalism|publisher=National Review Online|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This argument is fueled by the fact that those people socialized into 'western' world views believe the earth itself is not a living being. Wesley Smith believes this is “[[Antihumanism|anti-humanism]] with the potential to do real harm to the human family.”&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"/&gt; According to Smith, earth worshipers are hindering large-scale development, and they are viewed as inhibitors of advancement.

===Negative representatives===
A lot of criticism of earth religion comes from the negative actions of a few people who have been chastised for their actions. One such negative representative of earth religion is [[Aleister Crowley]]. He is believed to be "too preoccupied with awakening magical powers"&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=Herman|title=Earth Religion News|journal=geraldgardner.com|year=1976|volume=I|issue=1|pages=2–3|url=http://geraldgardner.com/archive/ern/Earth_Religion_News.php|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  instead of putting the well-being of others in his coven. Crowley allegedly looked up to [[George Pickingill|"Old George" Pickingill]], who was another worshipper of nature who was viewed negatively. Critics regarded Pickingill as a Satanist and "England’s most notorious Witch".&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

Crowley himself was "allegedly expelled from the Craft because he was a pervert."&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt; He became aroused by torture and pain, and enjoyed being "punished" by women.&lt;ref name="The Great Beast: Aleister Crowley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Symonds|first=John|title=The Great Beast|year=1952|publisher=Roy|isbn=0356036316|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically damaged Crowley’s public image, because of his lifestyle and actions. Many people regarded all followers of earth religion as perverted Satanists.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

===Accused of Satanism===
Followers of earth religion have suffered major opprobrium over the years for allegedly being [[Satanism|Satanists]]. Some religious adherents can be prone to viewing religions other than their religion as being wrong sometimes because they perceive those religions as characteristic of their concept of Satan worship. To wit, [[Witchcraft]], a common practice of [[Wicca]]ns, is sometimes misinterpreted as Satan worship by members of these groups, as well as less-informed persons who may not be specifically religious but who may reside within the sphere-of-influence of pagan-critical religious adherents. From the Wiccan perspective, however, earth religion and Wicca lie outside of the phenomenological world that encompasses Satanism.&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Wicca?|url=http://www.thecircleofthesacredwell.org/more_info/what_is_wicca.htm|work=An Eclectic Neopagan Circle|publisher=The Circle of the Sacred Well|accessdate=12 March 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Wicca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicca: a Neopagan, Earth-centered religion|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm|work=Religioustolerance.org|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-evil being does not exist within the religious perspective of western earth religions. Devotees worship and celebrate earth resources and earth-centric deities. Satanism and Wicca "have entirely different beliefs about deity, different rules for ethical behavior, different expectations from their membership, different views of the universe, different seasonal days of celebration, etc."&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"/&gt;

Neo-pagans, or earth religion followers, often claim to be unaffiliated with Satanism.&lt;ref name="Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/introductory/neo-pagan_satanism.php|work=Confusions and Distinctions|publisher=The Pagan Library|accessdate=20 March 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-pagans, Wiccans, and earth religion believers do not acknowledge the existence of a deity that conforms to the common Semitic sect religious concept of Satan. Satanism stems from Christianity, while earth religion stems from older religious concepts.&lt;ref name="Is Satanism Pagan?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vera|first=Diane|title=Is Satanism "Pagan"?|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/pagan/Is-Satanism-Pagan.html|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of Satanism as Religious Harassment====
Some earth religion adherents take issue with the religious harassment that is inherent in the social pressure that necessitates their having to distance themselves from the often non-uniform, Semitic sect religious concept of Satan worship. Having to define themselves as "other" from a religious concept that is not within their worldview implies a certain degree of outsider-facilitated, informal, but functional religious restriction that is based solely on the metaphysical and mythological religious beliefs of those outsiders. This is problematic because outsider initiated comparisons to Satanism with the intent of condemnation, even when easily refuted, can have the effect of social pressure on earth religion adherents to conform to outsider perception of acceptable customs, beliefs, and modes of religious behavior.

To illustrate, a problem could arise with the "other" than Satanism argument if an earth centered belief system adopted a holiday that a critic considered to be similar or identical to a holiday that Satanists celebrate. Satanists have historically been prone to adopting holidays that have origins in various pagan traditions, ostensibly because these traditional holidays are amongst the last known vestiges of traditional pre-Semitic religious practice in the west. Satanists are, perhaps irrationally, prone to interpreting non-Semitic holidays as anti-Christian and therefore as implicitly representative of their worldview. This is not surprising given the fact that this is, in fact, how many Christians interpret holidays such as [[Samhain]]. In spite of any flawed perceptions or rationale held by any other group, earth centered religion adherents do not recognize misinterpretation of their customs made by outside religious adherents or critics inclusive of Satan worshippers.

Organized Satan worship, as defined by and anchored in the Semitic worldview, is characterized by a relatively disorganized and often disparate series of movements and groups that mostly emerged in the mid-20th century. Thus, their adopted customs have varied, continue to vary, and therefore this moving target of beliefs and customs can not be justifiably nor continuously accounted for by earth centered religious adherents. Once a Satanist group adopts a holiday, social stigma may unjustifiably taint the holiday and anyone who observes it without discrimination as to whence and for what purpose it was originally celebrated. Given these facts, many earth centered religion devotees find comparisons to Satanism intrinsically oppressive in nature. This logic transfers to any and all religious customs to include prayer, magic, ceremony, and any unintentional similarity in deity characteristics (an example is the horned traditional entity Pan having similar physical characteristics to common horned depictions of Satan).

The issue is further complicated by the theory that the intra and extra-biblical mythology of Satan that is present throughout various Semitic sects may have originally evolved to figuratively demonize the heathen religions of other groups. Thus, the concept of Satan, or "the adversary", would have been representative of all non-Semitic religions and, by extension, the people who believed in them. Although, at times, the concept of the "other" as demonic has also been used to characterize competing Semitic sects. Amongst other purposes, such belief would have been extraordinarily useful during the psychological and physical process of cleansing Europe of traditional tribal beliefs in favor of Christianity. This possibility would account for the historical tendency of Christian authorities, for example, to deem most pagan customs carried out in the pagan religious context as demonic. By any modern standard, such current beliefs would violate western concepts of religious tolerance as well as be inimical to the preservation of what remains of the culture of long-persecuted religious groups.

==Ethics==
Because of the vast diversity of religions that fall under the title of ''earth religion'' there is no consensus of beliefs.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede" /&gt;  However, the [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs of most religions overlap. The most well-known ethical code is the [[Wiccan Rede]]. Many of those who practice an earth religion choose to be environmentally active. Some perform activities such as recycling or composting while others feel it to be more productive to try and support the earth spiritually.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt; These six beliefs about ethics seem to be universal.

"An [if] it harm none, do what ye will."&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Commonly worded in modern English as "if it doesn't harm anyone, do what you want."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Piper|first=David|title=Wiccan Ethics And The Wiccan Rede|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/ethics/wiccan_ethics_rede.php|publisher=paganlibrary.com|accessdate=15 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This maxim was first printed in 1964, after being spoken by the priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-20th century, and governs most ethical belief of Wiccans and some Pagans. There is no consensus of beliefs but this rede provides a starting point for most people's interpretation of what is ethical.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought"&gt;{{cite web|last=McColman|first=Carl|title=Principles of Moral Thought and Action|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Pagan/Ethics-Morality-Community/Principles-of-Moral-Thought-and-Action.html|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=14 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiccan Statement of Principles" /&gt;   The [[Wiccan Rede|rede]] clearly states to do no harm but what constitutes as harm and what level of self-interest is acceptable is negotiable.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="All About You" /&gt;  Many Wiccans reverse the phrase into "Do what ye will an it harm none," meaning "Do what you want if it doesn't harm anyone."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; The difference may not seem significant but it is. The first implies that it is good to do no harm but does not say that it is necessarily unethical to do so, the second implies that all forms of harm are unethical. The second phrase is nearly impossible to follow. This shift occurred when trying to better adapt the phrase into modern English as well as to stress the "harmlessness" of Wiccans. The true nature of the rede simply implies that there is personal responsibility for your actions. You may do as you wish but there is a [[karma]] reaction from every action.&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; Even though this is the most well-known rede of practice, it does not mean that those that choose not to follow it are unethical. There are many other laws of practice that other groups follow.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lark|title=Beyond The Wiccan Rede - Other Pagan Ethics|url=http://realpagan.net/forum/topics/beyond-the-wiccan-rede-other|publisher=realpagan.net|accessdate=15 Mar 2013|date=22 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Threefold Law===
[[Rule of Three (Wicca)|The Threefold Law]] is the belief that for all actions there is always a cause and effect. For every action taken either the good or ill intention will be returned to the action taker threefold. This is why the Wiccan Rede is typically followed because of fear of the threefold return from that harmful action.&lt;ref name=Threefold&gt;{{cite web|last=Wren|title=The Law of Three|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usfl&amp;c=basics&amp;id=2872|publisher=witchvox.com|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|date=16 Jul 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor===
[[File:Leaf at Rocky Point of McDonald Lake.jpg|thumb]]
This term is what [[Emma Restall Orr]] calls reverence for the earth in her book ''Living with Honour: A Pagan Ethics''. She separates the term into three sections: courage, generosity and loyalty, or honesty, respect and responsibility. There is no evil force in Nature.&lt;ref name=Honor /&gt;&lt;ref name="WFT Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|title=WFT Ethics|url=http://www.wiccanfamilytemple.org/wft-ethics|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing exists beyond the natural, therefore it is up to the individual to choose to be ethical not because of divine judgment.

'''''Ehi''''' is the name of a personal spirit in some West African religious beliefs, especially in southwestern [[Nigeria]] and [[Benin]].

''Ehi'' is a component of a person that remains with the supreme deity Osa.

Ehi must, therefore, be propritiated in much the same way as other supernatural entities and failure to do this results in trouble.&lt;ref name="Okpewho1998"/&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]], the creator god, will live for 100 years, with each day of these years made up of two [[kalpa (aeon)|''kalpas'']], and each ''kalpa'' lasting  4.32 billion human years.

{{History of religion}}

The '''history of religion''' refers to the written record of human [[religious]] experiences and ideas. This period of religious history begins with the [[invention of writing]] about 5,200 years ago (3200 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wrtg/hd_wrtg.htm |title=The Origins of Writing &amp;#124; Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prehistory of [[religion]] involves the study of religious beliefs that existed prior to the advent of written records. One can also study comparative religious chronology through a [[timeline of religion]].  Writing played a major role in standardizing religious texts regardless of time or location, and making easier the memorization of prayers and divine rules. The case of the Bible involves the collation of multiple oral texts handed down over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Humayun Ansari|title=The Infidel Within: Muslims in Britain Since 1800|year=2004|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. |isbn=978-1-85065-685-2|pages=399–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "religion" was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries,&lt;ref name=Nongbri1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|page=152 |quote=Although the Greeks, Romans, Mesopotamians, and many other peoples have long histories, the stories of their respective religions are of recent pedigree.

The concepts 'religion' and 'the religions', as we presently understand them, emerged quite late in Western thought, during the Enlightenment.

The word "religion" as used in the 21st century does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation into non-European languages. The anthropologist Daniel Dubuisson writes that "what the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson. ''The Western Construction of Religion''. 1998. William Sayers (trans.) Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of other [[culture]]s' interaction with the "religious" category is therefore their interaction with an idea that first developed in [[Europe]] under the influence of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald.

==History of study==
The school of religious history called the [[History of religions school|''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'']], a late 19th-century [[Germany|German]] school of thought, originated the systematic study of [[religion]] as a [[society|socio]]-[[culture|cultural]] phenomenon. It depicted religion as evolving with human culture, from primitive [[polytheism]] to [[ethical monotheism]].

The ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' emerged at a time when scholarly study of the [[Bible]] and of [[church history]] flourished in Germany and elsewhere (see [[higher criticism]], also called the ''historical-critical method''). The study of religion is important: religion and similar concepts have often shaped civilizations' law and moral codes, social structure, art and music.

==Overview==
The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in knowledge about a wide variety of [[cultures]] and religions, and also the establishment of economic and social histories of [[social progress|progress]]. The "history of religions" school sought to account for this religious diversity by connecting it with the social and economic situation of a particular group.

Typically, religions were divided into stages of progression from simple to complex societies, especially from [[polytheistic]] to [[monotheistic]] and from extempore to organized. One can also classify religions as circumcising and non-circumcising, proselytizing (attempting to convert people of other religion) and non-proselytizing. Many religions share common beliefs.

==Origin==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions|Timeline of religion}}
The earliest evidence of religious ideas dates back several hundred thousand years to the [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle]] and [[Lower Paleolithic]] periods. Archaeologists refer to apparent intentional burials of [[Archaic humans|early ''Homo sapiens'']] from as early as 300,000 years ago as evidence of religious ideas. Other evidence of religious ideas include symbolic artifacts from [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. However, the interpretation of early paleolithic artifacts, with regard to how they relate to religious ideas, remains controversial. Archeological evidence from more recent periods is less controversial. Scientists({{which|date=July 2017}} generally interpret a number of artifacts from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (50,000-13,000 BCE) as representing religious ideas. Examples of Upper Paleolithic remains associated with religious beliefs include the [[löwenmensch figurine|lion man]], the [[Venus figurines]], cave paintings from [[Chauvet Cave]] and the elaborate ritual burial from [[Sungir]].

In the 19th century researchers proposed various theories regarding the origin of religion, challenging earlier claims of a Christianity-like [[urreligion]]. Early theorists [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832-1917) and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820-1903) proposed the concept of [[animism]], while archaeologist  [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] (1834-1913) used the term "[[fetishism]]". Meanwhile, religious scholar [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900) theorized that religion began in [[hedonism]] and folklorist [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] (1831-1880) suggested that religion began in "naturalism", by which he meant mythological explanation of natural events.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion". ''Encyclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', 70 vols. Madrid. 1907-1930.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} All of these theories have since been widely criticized; there is no broad consensus regarding the origin of religion.

[[Pre-pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) [[Göbekli Tepe]], the oldest religious site yet discovered anywhere&lt;ref name="ArchMag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov–Dec 2008 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes circles of erected massive T-shaped stone pillars, the world's oldest known [[megalith]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|title=The Archaeology of Malta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107006690|page=47|language=en|last1=Sagona|first1=Claudia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and [[sculpture|carved]] animal reliefs. The site, near the home place of original wild wheat, was built before the so-called [[Neolithic Revolution]], i.e., the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] around 9000 BCE. But the construction of Göbekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies. The site, abandoned around the time the first agricultural societies started, is still being excavated and analyzed, and thus might shed light to the significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities, as well as for the general history of religions.  

The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are the oldest known [[religious texts]] in the world, dating to between 2400-2300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=the+pyramid+texts+oldest+religious|title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|last=Budge|first=Wallis|isbn=0-486-29502-8|page=9|authorlink=E.

Surviving early copies of complete religious texts include: 

The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], representing complete texts of the Hebrew [[Tanakh]]; these scrolls were copied approximately 2000 years ago. 

Complete Hebrew texts, also of the [[Tanakh]], but translated into the Greek language ([[Septuagint]] 300-200 BC), were in wide use by the early [[1st century]] CE. 

===Advantages of religion===
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability to large populations through the following ways:
* Organized religion served to justify a central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services to the state. The empires of [[India]] and [[Mesopotamia]] were [[theocracies]], with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and [[spiritual leader]]s.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book
|title= [[The Science of Good and Evil]]
|isbn= 0-8050-7520-8
|last= Shermer
|first= Michael
|authorlink= Michael Shermer
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtually all state societies and chiefdoms around the world have similar political structures where political authority is justified by divine sanction.
* Organized religion emerged as means of maintaining peace between unrelated individuals. Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However states and nations include thousands or millions of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. He argues that a leading cause of death among band and tribal societies is murder.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;Compare: {{cite book|

==Axial age==
{{See also|Axial Age}}
Historians have labelled the period from 900 to 200 BCE as the "axial age", a term coined by [[Germany|German]]-Swiss [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883-1969). According to Jaspers, in this era of history "the [[spirituality|spiritual]] foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently... And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today." Intellectual historian [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] has summarized this period as the foundation time of many of humanity's most influential philosophical traditions, including [[monotheism]] in [[Persia]] and [[Canaan]], [[Platonism]] in Greece, [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] in India, and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] in China. These ideas would become institutionalized in time - note for example [[Ashoka]]'s role in the spread of Buddhism, or the role of [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|platonic philosophy in Christianity]] at its foundation.

The historical roots of Jainism in India date back to the 9th-century BCE with the rise of [[Parshvanatha]] and his non-violent philosophy.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p= 182-183}}{{qn|date=July 2017}}

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Medieval-World-Religions.png|thumb|Medieval world religions]]
[[World religion]]s of the present day established themselves throughout [[Eurasia]] during the [[Middle Ages]] by:

* [[Christianization]] of the [[Western world]]
* [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist missions to East Asia]]
* the [[decline of Buddhism in India|decline of Buddhism]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]
* the [[spread of Islam]] throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]] and parts of [[Europe]] and India

During the Middle Ages, [[Muslim]]s came into conflict with [[Zoroastrian]]s during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (633-654); [[Christian]]s fought against Muslims during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]] (7th to 11th centuries), the [[Crusades]] (1095 onward), the [[Reconquista]] (718-1492), the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] (13th century onwards) and the [[Inquisition]]; [[Shamanism]] was in conflict with [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Taoism|Taoists]], Muslims and Christians during the [[Mongol invasions]] (1206-1337); and Muslims clashed with [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s during the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] (8th to 16th centuries).

Many medieval religious movements emphasized [[mysticism]], such as the [[Cathars]] and related movements in the West, the Jews in Spain (see [[Zohar]]), the [[Bhakti movement]] in India and [[Sufism]] in Islam. [[Monotheism]] reached definite forms in Christian [[Christology]] and in Islamic [[Tawhid]]. [[Hindu views on monotheism|Hindu monotheist]] notions of [[Brahman]] likewise reached their classical form with the teaching of [[Adi Shankara]] (788-820).

==Modern period==
European [[colonisation]] during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and to the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and the [[Philippines]]. The invention of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century played a major role in the rapid spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]] under leaders such as [[Martin Luther]] (1483-1546) and [[John Calvin]] (1509-1564).  Wars of religion broke out, culminating in the [[Thirty Years War]] which ravaged central Europe between 1618 and 1648. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularisation]] in Europe, gaining momentum after the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and following. By the late 20th century religion had declined in most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the regimes of [[Communist Eastern Europe]] and of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] were anti-religious. A great variety of [[new religious movements]] originated in the 20th century, many proposing [[syncretism]] of elements of established religions. Adherence to such new movements is limited, however, remaining below 2% worldwide in the period 2000-2009. Adherents of the classical world religions account for more than 75% of the world's population, while adherence to indigenous [[tribal religion]]s has fallen to 4%. {{As of|2005}}, an estimated 14% of the world's population identifies as [[nonreligious]].{{Fact|date=November 2018}}

By 2001 people began to use the internet to discover or adhere to their religious beliefs. In January 2000 the website [[beliefnet]] was established, and the following year, every month it had over 1.7 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zabriskie, Phil|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010608152025/http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/religion/god_np.html|title=I Once Was Lost, but Now I'm Wired |publisher=''[[Time Asia]]''|date=2001-06-04|volume=157|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below is based upon global [[Gallup Poll]] in 2009 research which asked "Is religion important in your daily life?". Percentages for "yes" and "no" answers are listed below; they often do not add up to 100% because some answered "don't know" or did not answer.&lt;ref name=gallup-religiosity-poor-nations&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crabtree|first1=Steve|title=Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=27 May 2015}} (in which numbers have been rounded)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18368">Depictions of a fictional [[theocracy|theocratic]] societies recur in [[science fiction]], [[speculative fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. Such depictions are mostly [[dystopian]], and in some cases humorous or satirical; positively presented theocracies are very much the exception.

Some fictional theocracies are based on a future or [[alternate history]] development of actual [[religion]]s, whilst in others the religions depicted are wholly fictional.

The following table is sorted by time of publication (for series, time of earliest publication).

The '''list of foods with religious symbolism''' provides details, and links to articles, of foods which are used in religious communities or traditions to symbolise an aspect of the faith, or to commemorate a festival or hero of that faith group. Many such foods are also closely associated with a particular date or season. As with all religious traditions, some such foods have passed into widespread secular use, but all those on this list have a religious origin. The list is arranged alphabetically and by religion.

Many religions have a particular 'cuisine' or tradition of cookery, associated with their culture (see, for example, [[List of Jewish cuisine dishes]]). This list is ''not'' intended for foods which are merely part of the cultural heritage of a religious body, but ''specifically'' those foods that bear religious symbolism in the way they are made, or the way they are eaten, or both.

Just so, too, when the Christian dies, the body is left in the grave, an empty shell, but the soul takes wings and flies away to be with God. Thus you see that though an egg seems to be as dead as a stone, yet it really has life in it; and also it is like Christ's dead body, which was raised to life again. This is the reason we use eggs on Easter. (In days past some used to color the eggs red, so as to show the kind of death by which Christ died,-a ''bloody'' death.)|year=1878|accessdate =7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remarks:''' Ranked by mean estimate which is in brackets. Irreligious includes agnostic, atheist, secular believer, and people having no formal religious adherence. It does not necessarily mean that members of this group don't belong to any religion. Some religions have harmonized with local cultures and can be seen as a cultural background rather than a formal religion. Additionally, the practice of officially associating a family or household with a religious institute while not formally practicing the affiliated religion is common in many countries. Thus, over half of this group is theistic and/or influenced by religious principles, but nonreligious/non-practicing and not true atheists or agnostics.&lt;ref name="adherents.com"/&gt; See ''[[Spiritual but not religious]]''.

===Taoists/Confucianists/Chinese traditional religionists===
As a spiritual practice, Taoism has made fewer inroads in the West than Buddhism and Hinduism. Despite the popularity of its great classics the I Ching and the Tao Te Ching, the specific practices of Taoism have not been promulgated in America with much success;&lt;ref&gt;Occhiogrosso, Peter. ''The Joy of Sects: A Spirited Guide to the World's Religious Traditions''. New York: Doubleday (1996); p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; these religions are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of bigger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. Nonetheless, Taoist ideas and symbols such as Taijitu have become popular throughout the world through Tai Chi Chuan, Qigong, and various martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/taoism/|title=BBC – Religion: Taoism|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh homeland is the [[Punjab(India)|Punjab]] state, in India, where today Sikhs make up approximately 61% of the population. This is the only place where Sikhs are in the majority. Sikhs have emigrated to countries all over the world – especially to English-speaking and East Asian nations. In doing so they have retained, to an unusually high degree, their distinctive cultural and religious identity.
Sikhs are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of larger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. But they can be found in many international cities and have become an especially strong religious presence in the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_sikh.html|title=Sikhs|website=Adherents.com|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[primate (bishop)|Primate]]
| A primate is a bishop to whom the title has been officially granted, usually the bishop of the oldest church of a nation. In the past the title carried jurisdiction over metropolitan bishops, but today usually it is purely honorific.
|-
| [[Major archbishop]]
| Major archbishops are the heads of some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Their authority within their ''sui juris'' church is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honors.
|-
| [[Metropolitan bishop]]
| A [[metropolitan bishop]] is an archbishop in charge of an [[ecclesiastical province]], or group of dioceses, and in addition to having immediate jurisdiction over his own archdiocese, also exercises some oversight over the other dioceses within that province. Sometimes a metropolitan may also be the head of an [[autocephalous]], ''[[sui iuris]]'', or [[autonomous area|autonomous]] church when the number of adherents of that tradition are small. In the Latin Rite, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churches, the title is "metropolitan," with some of these churches using "archbishop" as a separate office.
|-
| [[Archbishop]]
| An archbishop is the bishop of an [[archdiocese]]. This is usually a prestigious diocese with an important place in local church history. In the Roman Catholic Church, the title is purely honorific and carries no extra jurisdiction, though most archbishops are also [[metropolitan bishop]]s, as above. 
|-
| [[Suffragan bishop]]
| A [[suffragan bishop]] is a bishop subordinate to a Metropolitan.
|-
| [[Titular bishop]]
| A [[titular bishop]] is a bishop appointed to an [[episcopal see]] that is no governed by a residential (a [[titular see]]). He may serve as an [[auxiliary bishop]] of a diocese or as an official of the [[Roman Curia]].
|-
| [[Auxiliary bishop]]
| An [[auxiliary bishop]] is a [[titular bishop]] who is an assistant to a diocesan bishop. He is to be appointed as a [[vicar general]] or at least as an [[episcopal vicar]] of the diocese in which he serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM | title=Canon 406 | work=Code of Canon Law | year=1983 | accessdate=2009-06-15 | publisher=The [[Holy See]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Coadjutor bishop]]
| A [[coadjutor bishop]] is an assistant bishop who has the automatic right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop. The appointment of coadjutors is often seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership.
|-
| [[Chorbishop]]
| A chorbishop is an official of a diocese in some Eastern Christian churches. Chorbishops are not generally ordained bishops – they are not given the sacrament of Holy Orders in that degree – but function as assistants to the diocesan bishop with certain honorary privileges.

This was propagated by certain [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapists]], [[social work]]ers, [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Christian fundamentalists]] and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officials. Some of the cases ended in prosecution and imprisonment. Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have had several incidents of alleged SRA which received national and international news coverage. Other countries have also had isolated events in which abuse or murder took place with Satanic ritual elements, including Argentina and Brazil.

==Australia==

===Perth, Western Australia===
In 1991, police in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] linked Scott Gozenton, a self-professed Satanist, with organised child sexual abuse. His lawyer claimed 13 Satanic [[coven]]s existed in the area, holding bizarre orgies involving children, and that Gozenton had been followed and threatened by "coven" members throughout the court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Humphries | title = Child Sex Abuse Linked With Satanism: Police | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 1991-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melbourne, Victoria===
In 2001, the Melbourne diocese of the [[Catholic Church]] acknowledged as "substantially true" allegations that a Melbourne priest took part in Satanic ritual abuse in which a number of deaths occurred in the 1960s, and paid compensation to a surviving victim.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Hughes, Church pays victim of sex and death rituals: Priest's satanic life, Herald Sun, 26 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Coast, New South Wales===
In 1999, two journalists from the Sun-Herald claimed to have seen evidence of the ritual abuse of children. They interviewed six mothers whose children had disclosed experiences of SRA and organised abuse in New South Wales. The children's disclosures were corroborating, although they had never met one another, and they had been able to draw representations of "Satanic" ritual sites which were similar to ritual sites uncovered by police on the central coast of New South Wales. One mother stated that her sons remembered being drugged and hypnotised. "He said they dressed in black robes and had eye and mouth pieces cut out," she said. "I know they're  dangerous people. I have had warnings outside the house telling me to stop investigations. We're fearful for our lives. The boys never want me out of their sight."&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Wood and martin Chulov, Evil In The Woods, The Sun Herald, 8 August 1999, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
{{Main article|Anísio Ferreira de Sousa}}
In the early 1990s, Superior Universal Alignment, an Argentinian-based international cult, was implicated in the ritualistic murders of several children. One of the leaders of the group, Osvaldo Marcineiro, confessed to murdering a number of young children in Satanic rituals in which the children were tortured and their body parts cannibalised. A number of prominent citizens were arrested in relation to the murders, and it later emerged that they had paid the cult to conduct the murderous ceremonies. A search of cult member's houses turned up cult registers, guns, hooded cloaks, 100 videotapes of cult ceremonies and satanist publications, including a 200-page book by cult leader Valentina de Andrade called ''God, the Great Farce''. Brazilian authorities suggested that the cult was connected to Satanic groups internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Lewan, Satanic Cult Killings Spread Fear in Southern Brazil, ''The [[Associated Press]]'', 26 October 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, five members of the Superior Universal Alignment cult in the Amazonian town of Altamira were convicted for the ritualistic murders of three children and the castration of two others. The victims were aged between eight and thirteen years, and they were kidnapped, tortured or killed between 1989 and 1993. Their genitals were removed and used in Satanic rituals by 75-year old village clairvoyant, Valentina de Andrade, the leader of the Superior Universal Alignment cult.&lt;ref&gt;Gamini, Gabriella, "Seer for trial in voodoo murders", ''[[The Times]]'', 9 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; De Andrade had previously been sought by police in Argentina and Uruguay prior to her arrest in Brazil on suspicion of involvement in other satanic ritual killings.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Cultic Studies Association|The Cult Observer]] (American Family Foundation), Vol. 10 No. 5, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the castration of victims, two doctors involved in the sect removed the victim's other organs for sale on the international black market. Other people sentenced in relation to the murders included a former police officer, a businessman and the son of an influential landowner. The charges related to the murders of three young children and the attempted murder of another, however, victim's families say that there were at least nineteen other murdered children. The cult is based in Argentina and has branches in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor gets 56 years for Brazil sect killings, 11 September 2003, [[Reuters]] News and Five&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Michelle Remembers|Martensville satanic sex scandal}}
One of the earliest claims of SRA was made in the book ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' co-written by Canadian psychiatrist [[Lawrence Pazder]] and Michelle Smith, later Pazder's wife. The book detailed a Satanic cult that allegedly operated in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author = Paul Grescoe |title = Things That Go Bump in Victoria |work = [[Maclean's]] |date = October 27, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wenegrat, Brant |title=Theater of disorder: patients, doctors, and the construction of illness |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] | url =  |year=2001 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=o5i5utgOjvgC&amp;pg=PA190 190–192] |isbn=0-19-514087-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protracted child custody case contested in family court in Hamilton, Ontario, from 1985-1987, centred on allegations of Satanic ritual abuse; it was later documented in a book written by a Globe and Mail reporter who was assigned to cover the case.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.thespec.com/news-story/2525179-passages-respected-author-longtime-reporter/ Passages: Respected Author, Longtime Reporter]''.

The Martensville Satanic sex scandal occurred in Martensville, Saskatchewan in 1992, where an allegation of day care sexual abuse hysteria escalated into claims of satanic ritual abuse.

In 1989 a group of parents published allegations in a conservative magazine that their children had witnessed SRA and had been ritually abused from May, 1987 until October 1988 in [[Oude Pekela]], a city in the north-eastern province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[the Netherlands]].  During the initial investigation, only the non-ritual aspects were reported in the press and investigated by the authorities and the allegations were unconfirmed.  In 1989 the [[Conservatism|conservative]] Christian news program ''Tijdsein'' reported allegations that included Satanic ritual abuse, to which there was no official response.  After attending a conference in which the concept of satanic ritual abuse was discussed, Oude Pekela [[general practitioner]]s Fred Jonker and Ietje Jonker-Bakker alleged that several children had been abused by unknown men in the context of Satanic rituals.  This was first reported in a lecture at the Institute of Education of London University and later published in several [[academic journal]]s in both English and Dutch,&lt;ref name=Jonker1991&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jonker, F. |author2=Jonker-bakker, P.  | year = 1991 | title = Experiences with ritualist child sexual abuse: a case study from the Netherlands | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 15 | pages = 191–196 | url = http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429991  | accessdate = 2007-10-20 | pmid =2043971  | doi = 10.1016/0145-2134(91)90064-K | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jonker F &amp; Jonker-Bakker I | title = Onderzoek in Oude Pekela | journal = Maandblad Geestelijke volksgezondheid | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | year = 1994 | pages = 251–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their findings were heavily criticised by American and Dutch scholars.&lt;ref name = Beetstra&gt;{{cite book | last = Beetstra | first = T A | chapter = Massahysterie in de Verenigde Staten en Nederland: De affaire rond de McMartin Pre-School en het ontuchtschandaal in Oude Pekela |editor=Burger P |editor2=Koetsenruijter W | title = Mediahypes en moderne sagen: Sterke verhalen in het nieuws | publisher = Leiden, Stichting Neerlandistiek Leiden | year = 2004 | pages =53–69 | chapterurl = http://tjallingbeetstra.eu/files/Massahysterie%20in%20de%20Verenigde%20Staten%20en%20Nederland.PDF |chapter-format = PDF | language = Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Merckelbach HLGJ &amp; Crombag HFM | title = Hervonden herinneringen en andere misverstanden | publisher = Contact, Amsterdam/Antwerpen Contact | year = 1996 | pages = 183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Putnam1991&gt;{{cite journal | author = Putnam, F.W. | year = 1991 | title = The Satanic Ritual Abuse Controversy. | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect: the International Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–79 | url = http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429989  | accessdate = 2008-06-10 | doi = 10.1016/0145-2134(91)90062-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wessel | first = I |author2=Merckelbach HLGJ  | title = Onderzoek in Oude Pekela (2) | journal = Maandblad Geestelijke volksgezondheid | volume = 49 | issue = 5  | year = 1994 | pages = 554–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National authorities were informed in 1991 and 1992 of the allegations, though no action was taken until the press was informed.&lt;ref name = Het&gt;{{cite news | last = De Fauwe | first = L | title = Ritueel misbruik van kinderen voor satan | publisher = [[Het Parool]] | date = 1993-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Aanhangsel tot het Verslag der Handelingen van de Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal | year = 1992–1993 | issue = 770}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The State Secretary of Justice responded to the allegations by appointing the ''Werkgroep Ritueel Misbruik'' multidisciplinary workgroup to study SRA in the Netherlands, which produced a report in 1994.&lt;ref name = Werkgroep&gt;{{Cite book | author = Werkgroep Ritueel Misbruik | title = Rapport van de Werkgroep Ritueel Misbruik | location = Den Haag | publisher = Ministerie van Justitie, Directie Staats- en Strafrecht | year = 1994 | pages = 65–66 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report concluded that it was unlikely SRA had occurred or the allegations were factually true, suggested the allegations were a [[defence mechanism]] produced in part by suggestive questioning by 'believing' therapists, and that the stories were contemporary legends dispersed through a network of therapists and patients who were concerned with [[dissociative identity disorder]].&lt;ref name = Werkgroep/&gt;

===Van Rooyen case===
In 1990, [[Gert van Rooyen]] and his accomplice were accused of murdering several young girls, ultimately committing [[suicide]] while running from the police. One of the accused's sons was later himself accused of murdering a [[Zimbabwe]]an girl in 1991; the same son claimed his father's victims were involved in international child pornography rings, slavery and Satanism rituals, but no evidence of this was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/the-sins-of-the-father-a-dark-legacy-1.322143 | publisher = [[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]] | title = The sins of the father: a dark legacy | date = 2007-04-08 | accessdate = 2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/paedophile-gert-van-rooyen-and-mistress-commit-suicide |title=Paedophile Gert van Rooyen and mistress commit suicide |publisher=sahistory.org.za |date=16 January 1990|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police take down paedophile's "house of horrors" brick by brick | date = 1996-05-13 | publisher = Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was so similar to crimes committed by [[Marc Dutroux]] that multiple agencies investigated a possible international smuggling ring in prostituted children and body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = South African police probe possible body-part smuggling ring | publisher = Agence France-Presse | date = 1996-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
There have been a number of cases in the [[United Kingdom]] in which SRA has been alleged. Some of these cases have garnered significant media attention, and they are listed below.

The [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] documented allegations of ritual abuse in 1990, with the publication of survey findings that, of 66 child protection teams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 14 teams had received reports of ritual abuse from children and seven of them were working directly with children who had been ritually abused, sometimes in groups of 20.&lt;ref&gt;Libby Jukes and Richard Duce, NSPCC says [[ritual child abuse]] is rife, ''The Times'', 13 March 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  An investigation into SRA allegations by the British government produced over two hundred reports, of which only three were substantiated and proved to be examples of [[Satanic ritual abuse#Pseudo-satanism|pseudosatanic]], in which sexual abuse was the actual motivation and the rituals were incidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=La Fontaine, J S. |title=The extent and nature of organised and ritual abuse: research findings |publisher=HMSO |location=London |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-11-321797-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-04-29|url = http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=157278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = LaFontaine&gt;{{cite book |author=LaFontaine, J.

===Cleveland===
{{Main|Cleveland child abuse scandal}}
The [[Cleveland child abuse scandal]] featured allegations of satanic ritual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Lafontaine, 1998, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rochdale===
In 1990 there was a case in [[Rochdale]] which around twenty children were removed from their homes by social services who alleged the existence of SRA after discovering 'Satanic indicators'. No evidence was found of Satanic apparatus, and charges were dismissed when a court ruled the allegations were untrue. The children who were removed from their homes sued the city council in 2006 for compensation and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Paul |last=Lewis |authorlink= |title= 'Satanic abuse' case families sue council for negligence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1684205,00.html |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-01-12 |accessdate = 2007-10-23 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orkney===
{{Main|South Ronaldsay child abuse scandal}}
In 1990-1991 nine children suspected of being sexually abused by their families and an alleged child abuse ring were removed by social services in [[Orkney]]. The abuse was also alleged to involve "ritualistic elements".&lt;ref name = Orkney&gt;{{cite news | title = Orkney abuse scandal victim to sue for lost youth | last = Thompson | first = Tanya | publisher = [[The Scotsman]] | date=  2006-09-11 | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=860&amp;id=1338842006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parents approached the media and made the case national and international news. In April 1991, a [[Sheriff Principal|sheriff]] ruled that the evidence was seriously flawed and the children were returned home.&lt;ref name = Orkney/&gt;

In June, social services appealed the sheriff's ruling&lt;ref name="BBC April 4"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = 1991: Orkney 'abuse' children go home | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = BBC News "On This Day" | date = 1991-04-04| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/4/newsid_2521000/2521067.stm | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the appeal was overturned and an official inquiry was established in August 1991, which after 9 months' investigation at a cost of £6 million, published its report in October 1992. It described the dismissal of the first judgment as "most unfortunate" and criticized all those involved, including the social workers, the police, and the Orkney Islands Council. Social workers' training, methods, and judgment were given special condemnation, and the report stated that the concept of "ritual abuse" was "not only unwarrantable at present but may affect the objectivity of practitioners and parents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bennett | first = Gillian | authorlink = | title = Bodies: Sex, Violence, Disease, and Death in Contemporary Legend | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 2005 | location = | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mp91ArpXcH0C&amp;pg=PA287 287] | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-57806-789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lord Clyde | year = 1992 | title = The Report of the Inquiry into the Removal of Children from Orkney in February 1991 | location = Edinburgh | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] | pages = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 government report based on three years of research found that there was no foundation to any of the Satanic abuse claims.&lt;ref name = Orkney/&gt;

===Broxtowe===
In October 1987 children were removed from their families in Nottingham, and in February 1989 a [[Broxtowe, Nottingham|Broxtowe]] family was charged with multigenerational child sexual abuse and neglect. A 600-page report on the incident concluded that there was no evidence of the SRA claims made by children or corroborating adults. Though the children may have been 'sadistically terrorized', allegations of organized Satanic abuse were found to be baseless and the indicators used by the Social Services department were without validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Thorpe | first = W. |author2=Gwatkin, J.B. |author3=Glenn, W.P. |author4=Gregory, M.F. | date=  1990-06-07 | title = Revised Joint Enquiry Report | url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~dlheb/jetrepor.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | publisher = Nottinghamshire Social Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lewis===
In 2003 allegations by three children in [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Scotland]] resulted in the arrest of eight people for sexual abuse occurring between 1990 and 2000.

===Kidwelly===
In March 2011, four adults who lived in a cul-de-sac in the Welsh town of [[Kidwelly]] were convicted of multiple sex offences against children and young adults. The group led by Colin Batley was described by the media as a "Satanic sex cult", a "quasi-religious sex cult" and a "paedophile cult"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-12677043|title=Kidwelly sex cult: Town unaware of 'evil paedophile'|date=9 March 2011|work=BBC News South West Wales|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Colin Batley, leader of sex cult preying on children, could spend life in jail|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/11/sex-cult-leader-colin-batley-sentenced|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the group members were not followers of [[Satanism]].   The prosecution said they practised "[[promiscuity|free sex]]" and were influenced by [[Aleister Crowley]], a practitioner of [[ceremonial magic]] who founded the belief system of [[Thelema]]. They dressed in hoods and read from Crowley's ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the central text of [[Thelema]] and some victims were made to wear [[inverted cross]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/03/09/five-found-guilty-in-sex-cult-trial-91466-28307889/ |title=Five found guilty in sex cult trial |last=Turner |first=Robin |date=9 March 2011 |work=WalesOnline |accessdate=9 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707070344/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/03/09/five-found-guilty-in-sex-cult-trial-91466-28307889/ |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the cult were initiated in a ceremony involving sex with an adult, and they were threatened with being killed if they did not take part in the ceremony. Some of the victims were forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/09/paedophile-satanic-cult-batley-kidwelly|title=Paedophile cult leader convicted for 'satanic' rape campaign|last=Press Association|date=9 March 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The abuse also took place outside of a ritual context, such as Batley taking victims to a caravan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1364583/Evil-paedophile-guilty-running-cul-sac-sex-cult-seaside-home.html|title='Evil' paedophile found guilty of running sex cult from cul-de-sac in seaside village|last=Evans|first=Rebecca| date=10 March 2011|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rape, in line with [[Jean La Fontaine]]'s findings and her conclusion that sexual gratification, not religion, is the motive of abusers.

==United States==
{{Main|Kern County child abuse cases|McMartin preschool trial|Ricky Kasso|West Memphis 3|Little Rascals Day Care Center|Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial|Fells Acres Day Care Center preschool trial|Pace memorandum}}
In the [[United States]], major allegations of Satanic ritual abuse occurred in the [[Kern County child abuse cases]], [[McMartin preschool trial]] and the [[West Memphis 3]], which garnered world-wide media coverage. It was eventually determined that no satanic abuse ever took place in these cases due to false testimony and police misconduct. There have been countless, debunked allegations of SRA in the United States; of which the most recent allegation was [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory|Pizzagate]]; a speculated pedophile ring in the Washington D.C area at supposed ping pong themed restaurant, Comet Ping Pong. In the allegations, [[Hillary Clinton]] was an avid supporter and member in the pedophilia ring, with various sources of selected evidence pointing to her possible involvement and the possible involvement of Clinton's associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/pizzagate-a-deep-dish-slice-of-fake-news-delusion/article33282231/|title=Pizzagate: A deep-dish slice of fake news delusion|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Minnesota===
The first such case occurred in [[Jordan, Minnesota]], in 1983, where several children made allegations against an unrelated man and their parents. The man confessed and then identified a number of the children’s parents as perpetrators. Ultimately twenty-four adults were charged with child abuse though only three went to trial with two [[acquittal]]s and one [[conviction]].&lt;ref name = Scalia&gt;{{cite web | url = http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-478.ZD.html | title = Supreme Court Collection at Cornell University Law School | last = Scalia | first = Antonin | authorlink = Antonin Scalia |author-link2=William J.

Albuguergue, NM  | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation, the children made [[allegation]]s regarding the manufacturing of [[child pornography]], ritualistic animal sacrifice, [[Coprophagia#Humans|coprophagia]], [[urophagia]] and [[infanticide]], at which point the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was alerted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hechler, David |title=The battle and the backlash: the child sexual abuse war |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=0-669-14097-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No criminal charges resulted from the FBI investigation, and in his review of the case, the [[Attorney General]] noted that the initial investigation by the local police and county attorney was so poor that it had destroyed the opportunity to fully investigate the children’s allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Humphrey | first = Herbert | year = 1985 | title = Report on Scott County investigations | location = Minneapolis, MN | publisher = Minnesota Attorney General's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Antonin Scalia]] referred to the Minnesota case in his summation on a later case, and stated, "[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged," and cited the repeated, well-intentioned but coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.&lt;ref name = Scalia/&gt;  The bizarre allegations of the children, the ambiguities of the investigation and the unsuccessful prosecutions were widely covered by the media. A number of accused parents confessed to sexually abusing their children, received immunity, and underwent treatment for sexual abuse, while parental rights for six other children in the case were terminated.&lt;ref name=Faller2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Faller, K.C. | year = 2004 | title = Sexual Abuse of Children: Contested Issues and Competing Interests | journal = Criminal Justice Review | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 358 | url = http://cjr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/29/2/358  | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | doi = 10.1177/073401680402900206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mapuche Machis.jpg|thumb|300px|Mapuche machis in 1903]] 
A '''machi''' is a [[traditional healer]] and religious leader in the [[Mapuche]] culture of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Machis play significant roles in [[Mapuche religion]]. In contemporary Mapuche culture women are more commonly machis than men.

==Description==
[[File:Machitún Mapuche.jpg|thumb|300px|Illustration of a machi healing a patient, from ''Atlas of Physical and Political History of Chile'' (''Atlas de la historia física y política de Chile''), by [[Claudio Gay]]]] 
As a religious authority, a machi leads healing ceremonies, called [[Machitun]]. During the machitun, the machi communicates with the spirit world. Machies also serve as advisors, and [[oracle]]s for their community. In the past, they advised on peace and warfare.

The term is sometimes interchangeable with the word ''[[kalku]]'', however, ''kalku'' has a usually evil connotation whereas ''machi'' is usually considered good;  this, however, is not always true since in common use the terms may be interchanged.

The Mapuches live in southern [[South America]] mostly in central [[Chile]] ([[Araucanía Region|Araucanía]] and [[Los Lagos Region|Los Lagos]]) and the adjacent areas of [[Argentina]].

To become a machi, a Mapuche person has to demonstrate character, willpower, and courage, because initiation is long and painful. Usually a person is selected in infancy, based upon the following:
* premonitory dreams
* supernatural revelations
* influence of the family
* inheritance
* her or his power of healing disease
* own initiative

Machiluwun is the ceremony to consecrate a new machi. The chosen child will live six months with a dedicated machi, where he or she learns the skills to serve as a machi.

==Role in Mapuche medicine==
The machi is a person of great wisdom and healing power and is the main character of Mapuche medicine. The machi has detailed knowledge of medicinal herbs and other remedies, and is also said to have the power of the spirits and the ability to interpret dreams, called ''pewma'' (IPA pronunciation: {{IPA|pewma}}) in [[Mapudungun]]. Machis are also said to help communities identify witches or other individuals who are using supernatural powers to do harm.

Mapuche traditional medicine is gaining more acceptance in the broader Chilean society.

==Gender==
Becoming a Machi is a spiritual transformation that also fosters a place where people can flow between spectrums of gender. Within Machi rituals and ceremonies, gender is fluid and dynamic. The majority of Machi are female, but males can also be Machis. The Machi power is usually passed down from the maternal grandmother. Gender is not determined by sex, as it typically is in Chilean society, but rather by identity and spirituality and is ambiguous among Machi. Some scholars have coined this as "cogender", which is a partly feminine and partly masculine identity. Most of this research has focused on males and femininity versus females and masculinity, but all forms of gender fluidity are present within Machi culture. During some ceremonies gender is transcended and transformed spiritually, where binaries between genders do not exist and new gender identities are explored.

Within Machi culture, plants and spirits are given gender. Usually these assigned genders are based upon perceptions of masculinity and femininity. E.g. Laurel is a feminine plant because it is regarded as soothing and soft, whereas Triwe is masculine because it has protective powers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Austin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genders are fixed and do not change. Machi, however, transcend static gender and dynamically flow between them. For example, during healing ceremonies Machis can flow between male, female, and cogendered identities in order to balance the spirit of the person they are healing. As ''Shamans of the Foye Tree'' says, “gender of spirits remain permanent, whereas Machi move between gender identities”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in Machi cosmology, the Nguchen, or the giver of life, is balanced by 4 identities; the man, the woman, the young man and the young woman. Therefore, during ceremonies Machis embody some or all of these identities at different times or simultaneously in order to heal. When someone is sick, Machis believe it is because the 4 are out of balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The magic mountain and other origin myths of the mapuche indians of central chile.|last=Faron|first=Louis|publisher=The Journal of American Folklore|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus within Mapuche culture, there are “well defined notions of gender, but Machis are able to manipulate them”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, gender exists in two realities, the earthly where gender is fixed and spiritual where gender in fluid. Machis are able to flow between both realities freely.

=== Gender Roles and Discrimination ===
While the Machis accept many different and even conflicting identities, Chilean society does not. Transgender Machi women who do not fit into traditional gender roles face a lot of discrimination and [[transphobia]]. Homophobia and transphobia are rampant in Chilean and Mapuche culture. The Machis are respected, but also shunned. Machi women are not viewed fully as women by Mapuche society because of their “masculine power” and Machi men are not viewed fully as male because of their femininity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Male machis, also called the Machi Weye, face discrimination from other Mapuches. Males are perceived as weak for taking upon a feminized role but are simultaneously regarded as more powerful than female machis. Yet other people view them as “not possessing as many powers as the [female] machis” because “females are more connected to nature”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigulapo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people view male machis as more powerful and adept than female machis due to traditional gender stereotypes of women inherently being weaker.  One Mapuche person states that while he discriminates against Machi men that  “when [he] is sick, when [he] needs a ngillatun, [he] goes begging to the male machi”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result of the gendered perception of Machis i.e. that they are usually female, many male machi face discrimination from fellow Mapuche and Chilean society as a whole. Since they do not fit conventional gender stereotypes, these feminine male Machis are out-casted and called derogatory names. One Mapuche states “they [male machi] may be stronger, but they wear women’s clothes...He must like pigs legs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many male Machi dress in women’s clothing as this is perceived to be more pious and connected to nature. Machismo in Chilean society plays a large role in such discrimination as men are out-casted from circles because they are seen as “too feminine”. In this way patriarchal culture simultaneously outcasts male Machi but also reinforces stereotypes that males are more powerful than females. As a result many male Machi have reinvented themselves as “celibate priests” or “spiritual warriors” in order to avoid further criticism and protect their masculinity. In some healing ceremonies and rituals male Machis are not permitted to participate because “they are not close enough to nature” and “[women] are more patient with the sick and know more about herbs…the spirits get along with women better”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, patriarchal culture works in multiple ways. It leads to discrimination and misogyny against male and female machi and also creates complicated power dynamics where in some circles women are perceived as inferior and in other circles perceived as more powerful.

Machi women are sometimes out-casted from traditional Mapuche gender roles. Machi women are revered and feared. Masculine female machi are called derogatory terms such as ''bruja'' (witch) ''mujer de la calle'' (woman of the street) or ''marica'' (derogatory term of homosexual). One Machi describes that Machi women are given a higher status than Mapuche women because “they are sent here [earth] by god” and are therefore divine. She says for example “she is served before other people [at meals]”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In this way the Machi regulate their own gender norms but are also combatted with traditional gender norms of Mapuche and Chilean society. This further complicates the notion of gender within the society.

Gender in Machi culture is filled with contradictions, paradoxes, and complications because they simultaneously exist within the gender binary and defy it.  “Whereas male Machi legitimate their sexuality as celibate priests, most female Machi gain status and virtue by marrying and having children”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Machi still abide by the gender roles and norms of Mapuche culture, but then fight against them during spiritual ceremonies and rituals where they challenge traditional roles and perceptions of gender and embrace cogendered identities.  
The gender identity and construction of the Machi is nuanced and complex. Machi are able to fluidly move between genders throughout different ceremonies, but then face discrimination from Chilean society and fellow Machis themselves. One Machi states, “Here people don’t talk much about homosexuality because it is looked down upon”. Some Machis are concerned about the way the West portrays Machis, afraid that they are only perceived as homosexuals or ''brujas'' “witches”. One Machi states “Why do anthropologists always say who we are? Why don’t they ask us?” [[Ana Bacigalupo]], a distinguished anthropologist in the field of Machi gender roles, urges people to see the nuances in Machi gender identity and allow complexity to exist.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Machis gendered identities and practices can be experienced and interpreted endlessly along different paths and for different purposes that simultaneously bind people together and draw them apart”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
A modern ritual human sacrifice occurred during the devastating [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|earthquake and tsunami of 1960]] by a machi of the Mapuche in the [[Budi Lake|Lago Budi]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Tierney (journalist)|Patrick Tierney]], ''The Highest Altar: Unveiling the Mystery of Human Sacrifice'' (1989) {{ISBN|978-0-14-013974-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim, five-year-old José Luis Painecur, had his arms and legs removed by Juan Pañán and Juan José Painecur (the victim's grandfather), and was stuck into the sand of the beach like a stake. The waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] then carried the body out to sea. The sacrifice was rumored to be at the behest of local machi, Juana Namuncurá Añen. The two men were charged with the crime and confessed, but later recanted. They were released after two years. A judge ruled that those involved in these events had "acted without free will, driven by an irresistible natural force of ancestral tradition." The arrested men's explanation was: "We were asking for calm in the sea and on the earth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869529,00.html "Asking for Calm."] ''Time Magazine''. 4 July 1960 (retrieved 28 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12377">'''Mun''' or '''Munism''' (also called '''Bongthingism''') is the traditional [[polytheism|polytheistic]], [[animism|animist]], [[shamanism|shamanistic]], and [[syncretism|syncretic]] religion of the [[Lepcha people]]. It predates the seventh century Lepcha conversion to [[Lamaism|Lamaistic Buddhism]], and since that time, the Lepcha have practiced it [[syncretism|together with]] Buddhism. Since the arrival of [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries in the nineteenth century, Mun traditions have been followed alongside that religion as well.

The [[exonym]] "Mun" derives from the traditional belief in spirits called ''mun'' or ''mung''. Together with ''bongthing'' (also ''bungthing'' or ''bóngthíng''), ''mun'' comprise a central element in the religion. These terms are also used to describe the shaman priesthood that officiates the respective spirits.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nebesky&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Religious Dances: Tibetan Text and Annotated Translation of the ʼChams Yig |volume=2 |series=Religion and Society |first=René |last=de Nebesky-Wojkowitz |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1976 |isbn=902797621X |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIHbKCpj9HEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mun religion and its priesthood are in decline.&lt;ref name=Das&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lepchas of West Bengal |first=Amal Kumar |last=Das |publisher=Editions Indian |year=1978 |pages=12, 193–97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9MtAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion to other religions is attributed to economic pressure, as traditional practices are immensely expensive to the ordinary practitioner.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt; It has, however, regained interest among Lepcha as ecological encroachment becomes a growing concern.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt; The environment is so deeply intertwined with Mun beliefs that religious leaders have offered direct opposition to development in areas including the [[Rathong Glacier|Rathong Chu]] and [[Teesta River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Independent People's Tribunal on Dams, Environment and Displacement |chapter=Sanctity, Environment, and Protest: A Lepcha Tale |first=Kery |last=Little |editor=Doma T Bhutia |publisher=Socio Legal Information Cent |year=2012 |isbn=8189479814 |pages=84–93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXpyQN_e2eoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
The traditional Lepcha belief system is rich in oral [[myth]]s, [[legend]]s, [[fable]]s, and [[fairy-tale]]s collectively called ''lúngten sung''.&lt;ref name=Plaisier&gt;{{cite book|title=Languages of the Greater Himalayan Region. A Grammar of Lepcha |volume=5 |series=Languages of the Greater Himalayan region |first=Heleen |last=Plaisier |publisher=Brill |year=2007 |isbn=9004155252 |pages=4, 15 (photo) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpCXEc_9RWcC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mun mythology, the ancestors of the Lepcha were created by Itbu Rum, who molded them from the pure snows of mount [[Kangchenjunga]]. They thus share a lineage with the natural environment and share the cosmos with non-human spirits.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

The spirit of the legendary [[Thekong Thek]] delivers reproaches to the Lepcha chief through ''mun'' or ''bongthing'' shamans.&lt;ref name=Nebesky/&gt;

==Belief system==
The belief system of Mun is animist, and the natural environment provides much of its basis. Naturally occurring spirits are an object of ceremonial dedication, and they reside in objects such as trees, rocks, and rivers. It is also a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religion that has coexisted with [[Mahayana Buddhism]] since its arrival in the seventh century, with practitioners following both religions at the same time. Traditional beliefs may have influenced Lepcha Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt; Modern religious life in a Lepcha village is centered on the ''gumpa'', or [[Buddhist monastery]].&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;

Many Lepcha were converted to [[Christianity]] by [[Scotland|Scottish]] missionaries in the 19th century, however Buddhism and the traditional religion have retained important roles in Lepcha religious life. Many Christian Lepcha who have lost their [[Lepcha language]] have also distanced themselves from these traditional aspects of Lepcha religion.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt;

Mun religion includes a belief in heaven, called ''rumlyang''.

===Deities===
The Mun religion is [[polytheistic]] and [[syncretic]]: it acknowledges several deities, including those of other religions, namely [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Himalayas: Bhutan Himalayas |volume=2 |first=Ramesh Chandra |last=Bisht |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=8183242650 |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWblUfYqGK4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief goddess of the Lepcha religion is Nozyongnyu.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt; The mother-creator is a female earth deity, It Bunoo (also Itbu-moo).&lt;ref name=West/&gt;&lt;ref name=NEI/&gt; Two other female deities are the chief of the ''mun'' spirits.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;

Traditional Lepcha beliefs include deities governing family, clan (or lineage, ''putsho''), village, region, and wider levels. Clan deities may be named after mountain peaks or rivers, while regions are home to deities associated with Kangchenjunga such as ''Chyu-rum-fat''. The traditional religion also incorporates [[Buddha]] and [[Jesus Christ]] as a deities, depending on household beliefs.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

===Mun spirits===
''Mun'' spirits are of two general types: the benevolent, or [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magic]]ian, ''taung-li mun'', and the malevolent, or [[black magic]]ian, ''mung-sek mun'' or ''mung''.&lt;ref name=NEI&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikkim |volume=10 |series=Discovery of North-East India: Geography, History, Culture, Religion, Politics, Sociology, Science, Education and Economy |editors=Suresh Kant Sharma, Usha Sharma |publisher=Mittal Publications |year=2005 |isbn=8183240445 |pages=325, 326, 329, 332 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBk3xBjSRbsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reside in trees, bushes, rocks, and rivers.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt; The spirits are further subdivided into seven classes: ''avor mun'', ''pildon mun'', ''angan mun'', ''tungli mun'', ''munjyum mun'', ''mun mook mun'' and ''lyang-eet mun''. ''Mun'' spirits, and witchcraft, are believed to be the invariable culprit of illness.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

==Rituals==
Ceremonies are usually performed for one or several households, and consist of two parts. The ''rum'' portion is an offering to devils. The second, ''tsandong'', is for offerings to the deity Kangchenjunga, to ''Chyu rum fat'', and to the plains. Ceremonies generally seek to appease these spirits.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt; ''Bongthing'' rituals generally include prayers, herbs, and amulets, and may also include directed breathing or spitting by the priest. Ritual prayers are sometimes in the form of [[glossolalia]].&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;&lt;ref name=NEI/&gt;

[[Spirit possession]] occurs in a variety of manners: from a subtle headache to violent, uncontrollable madness. Generally symptoms are the manifestation of ''mung'' spirits feeding off the flesh, blood, internal organs, or life energy of the host.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt; Ritual paraphernalia include the ''ghanta'' bell, ''damaru dru'' necklaces, and consecrated cup filled with ''chi''.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

The religion practices [[animal sacrifice]], especially of goats and pigs.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt;&lt;ref name=Das/&gt;

Mun priests are traditionally present at Lepcha celebrations for birth, marriage, and death. Among the Lepcha, Mun officiants are the only obligatory aspect of a commoner's funeral. The funerary ceremony, called ''dek flee'', is accompanied by the sacrifice of a goat and a hen three days after death. It is also performed at the home of people who die elsewhere, for fear of the spirit's return.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Rituals of Death: Buddhist Funerary Practices |series=Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism |first=Margaret |last=Gouin |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=1136959173 |page=253 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7i8Jv5RuPs4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auspicious locations and days, particularly in rural settings, may be required of rituals to address more severe ailments or threatening afflictions.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

Festivals are also a central aspect of the religion.&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt;

==Priesthood==
The priesthood consists of two types of shaman, corresponding to the spirits they manifest. ''Mun'' undergo [[spirit possession]], manifesting supernatural entities bodily, can be male or female. While ''bongthing'' are only male, where they have to learn and practice rituals. It is said that Bongthing came before Mun, so as to show respect, the Mun needs to learn both the Bongthing way and the Mun way. Mun undergo [[spirit possession]], manifesting supernatural entities bodily. Their main functions are to ward off misfortunes and illness, perform [[exorcism]]s, and guide souls to the [[afterlife]]. Some also adjudicate [[theft]] cases. Although the priesthood exists, the religion considers true knowledge to be a divine [[revelation]] through [[meditation]] or dreams, as opposed to a learned talent.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worldmark/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt;

Both the ''mun'' and ''bongthing'' priesthoods are hereditary, although they do not pass strictly patrilineally. Trained disciples of existing masters are often recruited to service at times of crisis as an election by ancestors or shamanic gods.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt; It is possible for a ''bongthing'' to advance to ''mun'' status.&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt;

''Padem'' are a male hereditary junior priesthood. A ''padem'' is usually an initiate on the path to becoming a ''mun'' shaman, and has the right to offer sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Himalayan Anthropology: The Indo-Tibetan Interface |series=World Anthropology |editor=James F. Fisher |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1978 |isbn=3110806495 |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Eq6Obu6oYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional priesthood also plays a role in the indigenous medical system, as they learn therapeutic knowledge and healing rituals.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

A '''nun''' is a member of a religious community of women, typically living under vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]] in the enclosure of a monastery.&lt;ref name=def&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary, vol X, page 599.&lt;/ref&gt; Communities of nuns exist in numerous religious traditions, including [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Taoism]].

In the Buddhist tradition, female [[monastic]]s are known as [[Bhikkhuni]], and take several [[The Eight Garudhammas|additional vows]] compared to male monastics ([[bhikkhus]]). Nuns are most common in [[Mahayana Buddhism]], but have more recently become more prevalent in other traditions.

Within Christianity, women religious, known as nuns or '''religious sisters''', are found in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Anglican]], and [[Lutheran]] traditions among others. Though the terms are often used interchangeably, ''nuns'' historically take solemn vows and live a life of prayer and contemplation in a [[monastery]] or [[convent]], while ''[[Religious sister|sister]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s'' take simple vows&lt;ref name=mw_sister&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sister|title=Sister|publisher=Merriam-Webster|quote=[A] member of a women's religious order (as of nuns or deaconesses); especially : one of a Roman Catholic congregation under simple vows }}&lt;/ref&gt; and live an active vocation of prayer and charitable works in areas such as education and healthcare. Examples include the monastic [[Order of Saint Clare]] founded in 1212 in the [[Franciscan]] tradition, or the [[Missionaries of Charity]] founded in 1950 by [[Mother Teresa]] to care for people living in grave poverty.

{{Main|Bhikkhuni}}
{{peoplepalicanon}}
All [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions have nuns, although their status is different among Buddhist countries. The Buddha is reported to have allowed women into the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' only with great reluctance, predicting that the move would lead to Buddhism's collapse after 500 years, rather than the 1,000 years it would have enjoyed otherwise. (This prophecy occurs only once in the Canon and is the only prophecy involving time in the Canon, leading some to suspect that it is a late addition.)&lt;ref&gt;Hellmuth Hecker, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel273.html#n-30].&lt;/ref&gt; Fully ordained Buddhist nuns (''[[bhikkhuni]]s'') have more ''[[Patimokkha]]'' rules than the monks (''[[bhikkhu]]s''). The important vows are the same, however.

As with monks, there is quite a lot of variation in nuns' dress and social conventions between Buddhist cultures in Asia. Chinese nuns possess the full ''bhikkuni'' ordination, Tibetan nuns do not. In [[Theravada]] countries it is generally believed that the full ordination lineage of ''bhikkunis'' died out, though in many places they wear the "saffron" colored robes, observing only ten precepts like novices.

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]], a country which never had a tradition of fully ordained nuns (''bhikkhuni''), there developed a separate order of non-ordained female renunciates called ''[[mae ji]]''. However, some of them have played an important role in dhamma-practitioners' community. There are in [[Thai Forest Tradition]] foremost nuns such as Mae Ji Kaew Sianglam, the founder of the Nunnery of Baan Huai Saai, who is believed by some to be [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/10/MCK/preface%20n%20intro.pdf Mae Chee Kaew - Her Journey to Spiritual Awakening &amp; Enlightenment e-book]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Upasika Kee Nanayon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enabling.org/ia/vipassana/Archive/N/Nanayon/keeNanayonThanisarro.html Upasika Kee Nanayon and the Social Dynamic of Theravadin Buddhist Practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004073724/http://www.enabling.org/ia/vipassana/Archive/N/Nanayon/keeNanayonThanisarro.html |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 21st century, some Buddhist women in Thailand have started to introduce the ''bhikkhuni sangha'' in their country as well, even if public acceptance is still lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1295,0,0,1,0 Buddhist Channel | Buddhism News, Headlines | Issues | Authoritarianism of the holy kind&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhammaweb.net/dhammananda.html Bhikkhuni Dhammananda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly the successful academic scholar Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, established a controversial monastery for the training of Buddhist nuns in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaibhikkhunis.org/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=3 Thai Bhikkhunis - Songdhammakalyani Monastery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226082911/http://www.thaibhikkhunis.org/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=3 |date=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===

The relatively active roles of Taiwanese nuns were noted by some studies. Researcher Charles Brewer Jones estimates that from 1952 to 1999, when the Buddhist Association of the ROC organized public ordination, female applicants outnumbered males by about three to one. He adds:

:"All my informants in the areas of Taipei and Sanhsia considered nuns at least as respectable as monks, or even more so. [...] In contrast, however, Shiu-kuen Tsung found in Taipei county that female clergy were viewed with some suspicion by society. She reports that while outsiders did not necessarily regard their vocation as unworthy of respect, they still tended to view the nuns as social misfits."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Brewer Jones, ''Buddhism in Taiwan: Religion and the State, 1660-1990''; University of Hawaii Press, 1999; pp. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt;

Wei-yi Cheng studied the Luminary (Hsiang Kuang 香光) order in southern Taiwan. Cheng reviewed earlier studies which suggest that Taiwan's [[Zhaijiao]] tradition has a history of more female participation, and that the economic growth and loosening of family restriction have allowed more women to become nuns. Based on studies of the Luminary order, Cheng concluded that the monastic order in Taiwan was still young and gave nuns more room for development, and more mobile believers helped the order.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Tibet ===
The August 2007 [[International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha]], with the support of H. H. [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|XIVth Dalai Lama]], reinstated the [[Gelongma]] ([[Dharmaguptaka]] [[vinaya]] bhikkhuni) lineage, having been lost, in India and Tibet, for centuries. Gelongma ordination requires the presence of ten fully ordained people keeping exactly the same vows. Because ten nuns are required to ordain a new one, the effort to establish the Dharmaguptaka bhikkhu tradition has taken a long time.

It is permissible for a Tibetan nun to receive bhikkhuni ordination from another living tradition, e.g., in Vietnam. Based on this, Western nuns ordained in Tibetan tradition, like [[Thubten Chodron]], took full ordination in another tradition.

The ordination of monks and nuns in Tibetan Buddhism distinguishes three stages: rabjung-ma, getshül-ma and gelong-ma. The clothes of the nuns in Tibet are basically the same as those of monks, but there are differences between novice and ''gelong'' robes.

===Japan===
[[Hokke-ji]] in 747 was established by the consort of the Emperor. It took charge of provincial convents, performed ceremonies for the protection of the state, and became the site of pilgrimages. Aristocratic Japanese women often became Buddhist nuns in the premodern period.  Originally it was thought they could not gain salvation because of the [[Five Hindrances]], which said women could not attain Buddhahood until they changed into men.  However, in 1249, 12 women received full ordination as priests.&lt;ref&gt;Lori Meeks, '' Hokkeji and the Reemergence of Female Monastic Orders in Premodern Japan'' (2010)  [https://www.amazon.com/Hokkeji-Reemergence-Monastic-Premodern-Buddhism/dp/0824833945/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman Catholic tradition, there are a large number of [[religious institute]]s of nuns and sisters (the female equivalent of male [[monk]]s or [[friar]]s), each with its own [[charism]] or special character. Traditionally, nuns are members of [[enclosed religious orders]] and take solemn [[religious vows]], while sisters do not live in the papal enclosure and formerly took vows called "simple vows".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

As [[monastic]]s, nuns living within an enclosure historically commit to recitation of the full [[Liturgy of the Hours]] throughout the day in church, usually in a solemn manner. They were formerly distinguished within the monastic community as "choir nuns", as opposed to [[lay brothers#Lay sisters|lay sisters]] who performed upkeep of the monastery or errands outside the cloister. This last task is still often entrusted to women, called "externs", who live in the monastery, but outside the enclosure. They were usually either [[oblate]]s or members of the associated [[Third Order]], often wearing a different habit or the standard woman's attire of the period.

====Membership and vows====
In general, when a woman enters a [[religious order]] or [[monastery]], she first undergoes a period of testing the life for six months to two years called a postulancy. If she, and the order, determine that she may have a [[vocation]] to the life, she receives the [[Religious habit|habit]] of the order (usually with some modification, normally a white veil instead of black, to distinguish her from [[Profession (religious)|professed]] members) and undertakes the [[novitiate]], a period (that lasts one to two years) of living the life of the religious institute without yet taking [[vows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P25.HTM Canon 648], CIC 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of this period she may take her initial, temporary vows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 656], CIC 1983&lt;/ref&gt; [[Temporary vows]] last one to three years, typically, and will be professed for not less than three years and not more than six.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 655], CIC 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, she will petition to make her "perpetual profession", taking permanent, [[solemn vow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 657], CIC 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

In the branches of the [[Benedictine]] tradition, (Benedictines, [[Cistercian]]s, [[Camaldolese]], and [[Trappist]]s, among others) nuns take vows of stability (that is, to remain a member of a single monastic community), obedience (to an [[abbess]] or [[prioress]]), and conversion of life (which includes poverty and celibacy). In other traditions, such as the [[Poor Clares]] (the [[Franciscan]] Order) and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican nuns]], they take the threefold vows of [[poverty]], [[chastity]] and [[vow of obedience|obedience]]. These are known as the ‘evangelical counsels’ as opposed to ‘monastic vows’ proper. Most orders of nuns not listed here follow one of these two patterns, with some Orders taking an additional vow related to the specific work or character of their Order (for example, to undertake a certain style of devotion, praying for a specific intention or purpose).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Cloistered nuns ([[Carmelites]], for example) observe "papal enclosure"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM Canon 667] §3, CIC 1983, SCRIS instruction, "Venite seorsum" August 15, 1969, in AAS 61 (1969) 674–690&lt;/ref&gt; rules, and their nunneries typically have walls separating the nuns from the outside world. The nuns rarely leave (except for medical necessity or occasionally for purposes related to their contemplative life) though they may receive visitors in specially built parlors, often with either a grille or half-wall separating the nuns from visitors. They are usually self-sufficient, earning money by selling jams, candies or baked goods by mail order, or by making liturgical items (such as vestments, candles, or hosts to be consecrated at Mass for Holy Communion).

They often undertake contemplative ministries &amp;mdash; that is, a community of nuns is often associated with prayer for some particular good or supporting the missions of another order by prayer (for instance, the Dominican nuns of [[Corpus Christi Monastery]] in [[the Bronx]], New York, pray in support of the priests of the [[Archdiocese of New York]]). Yet religious sisters can also perform this form of ministry, e.g., the [[Maryknoll]] Missionary Sisters have small houses of [[contemplative]] sisters, some in mission locations, who pray for the work of the priests, brothers and other sisters of their congregation, and since Vatican II have added retreat work and spiritual guidance to their apostoloate;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maryknollsisters.org/sisters/sister-grace-corde-myerjack/|title=Sister Grace Corde Myerjack - Maryknoll Sisters|work=Maryknoll Sisters|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sister Disciples of the Divine Master]] are also cloistered sisters who receive visitors and pray in support of their sister congregation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pddm.us/p.promise94.php|title=Vocation: Sister Disciples Of The Divine Master|website=www.pddm.us|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Daughters of St. Paul]] in their media ministry.

====Leadership====
A [[canoness]] is a nun who corresponds to the male equivalent of [[Canon (priest)|canon]], usually following the Rule of S. Augustine. The origin and rules of monastic life are common to both. As with the canons, differences in the observance of rule gave rise to two types: the [[canoness regular]], taking the traditional religious vows, and the secular canoness, who did not take vows and thus remained free to own property and leave to marry, should they choose. This was primarily a way of leading a pious life for the women of aristocratic families and generally disappeared in the modern age, except for the modern [[Stift#Stift as endowment for unmarried Protestant women|Lutheran convents]] of Germany.

A nun who is elected to head her religious house is termed an [[abbess]] if the house is an abbey, a prioress if it is a monastery, or more generically may be referred to as "Mother Superior" and styled "Reverend Mother". The distinction between abbey and monastery has to do with the terms used by a particular order or by the level of independence of the religious house. Technically, a [[convent]] is any home of a community of sisters &amp;mdash; or, indeed, of priests and brothers, though this term is rarely used in the United States. The term "monastery" is often used by The Benedictine family to speak of the buildings and "convent" when referring to the community. Neither is gender specific. ‘Convent’ is often used of the houses of certain other institutes.

The traditional dress for women in religious communities consists of a [[tunic]], which is tied around the waist with a cloth or leather belt. Over the tunic some nuns wear a [[scapular]] which is a garment of long wide piece of woolen cloth worn over the shoulders with an opening for the head. Some wear a white [[wimple]] and a veil, the most significant and ancient aspect of the habit. Some Orders – such as the Dominicans – wear a large rosary on their belt. Benedictine abbesses wear a cross or crucifix on a chain around their neck.

After the [[Second Vatican Council]], many religious institutes chose in their own regulations to no longer wear the traditional habit and did away with choosing a religious name. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church canon law]] states: "Religious are to wear the habit of the institute, made according to the norm of proper law, as a sign of their consecration and as a witness of poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Distinction between a nun and a religious sister ====

Although usage has varied throughout church history, typically "nun" (Latin: ''monialis'') is used for women who have taken solemn vows, and "sister" (Latin: ''soror'') is used for women who have taken simple vows.

During the first millennium, nearly all religious communities of men and women were dedicated to prayer and [[contemplative prayer|contemplation]]. These [[monasteries]] were built in remote locations or were separated from the world by means of a [[precinct wall]]. The [[mendicant orders]], founded in the 13th century, combined a life of prayer and dedication to God with active works of preaching, hearing confessions, and service to the poor, and members of these orders are known as [[friars]] rather than [[monks]]. At that time, and into the 17th century, Church custom did not allow women to leave the [[cloister]] if they had taken religious vows. Female members of the mendicant orders ([[Dominican Order|Dominican]], [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] and [[Carmelite]] nuns and [[Poor Clares]]) continued to observe the same enclosed life as members of the [[Monasticism|monastic orders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15551c.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mary Ward|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nun on a motor-bike 2 - by Francis Hannaway.jpg|thumb|A sister of the Theresienne Sisters of [[Basankusu]] wearing a brightly coloured habit, riding a motor-bike, [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://stbasankusu.blogspot.co.uk/ The Theresienne Sisters of Basankusu (La congrégation des soeurs thérésiennes de Basankusu)]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Originally, the vows taken by profession in any religious institute approved by the Holy See were classified as [[solemn vow|solemn]].&lt;ref name=Vermeersch&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Religious_Life Arthur Vermeersch,  "Religious Life"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115054809/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Religious_Life |date=2012-01-15 }} in ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. Accessed 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This was declared by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (1235–1303).&lt;ref&gt;"Illud solum votum debere dici solemne . . . quod solemnizatum fuerit per suceptionem S. Ordinis aut per professionem expressam vel tacitam factam alicui de religionibus per Sedem Apostolicam approbatis" (C. unic. de voto, tit. 15, lib. III in 6, quoted in [https://archive.org/stream/religiouscongreg00frer#page/16/mode/2up/search/%22Illud+solum+votum+debere+dici+solemne%22 Celestine Anthony Freriks, ''Religious Congregations in Their External Relations''], p. 17).&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed in the 16th century. In 1521, two years after the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] had forbidden the establishment of new religious institutes, [[Pope Leo X]] established a religious [[monasticism|Rule]] with simple vows for those [[third order|tertiaries]] attached to existing communities who undertook to live a formal religious life. In 1566 and 1568, [[Pope Pius V]] rejected this class of congregation, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval.&lt;ref name=Vermeersch/&gt; Finally in the 20th century, [[Pope Leo XIII]] recognized as religious all men and women who took simple vows.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution "Conditae a Christo" of 8 December 1900, cited in [http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf Mary Nona McGreal, ''Dominicans at Home in a New Nation'', chapter 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150743/http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their lives were oriented not to the ancient monastic way of life, but more to [[social service]] and to [[evangelization]], both in [[Europe]] and in mission areas. Their number had increased dramatically in the upheavals brought by the [[French Revolution]] and subsequent [[Napoleonic]] invasions of other Catholic countries, depriving thousands of religious of the income that their communities held because of inheritances and forcing them to find a new way of living the religious life. But members of these new associations were not recognized as "religious" until [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Constitution "Conditae a Christo" of 8 December 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf Mary Nona McGreal, ''Dominicans at Home in a New Nation'', chapter 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150743/http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1917 [[Code of Canon Law]] reserved the term "nun" (Latin: ''monialis'') for religious women who took solemn vows or who, while being allowed in some places to take simple vows, belonged to institutes whose vows were normally solemn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P1D.HTM#6T|title=CIC  1917: text - IntraText CT|website=www.intratext.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used the word "sister" (Latin: ''soror'') exclusively for members of institutes for women that it classified as "[[Congregation of Papal Right|congregations]]"; and for "nuns" and "sisters" jointly it used the Latin word ''religiosae'' (women religious). The same religious order could include both "nuns" and "sisters", if some members took solemn vows and others simple vows.

The new legal code of the Catholic Church which was adopted in 1983, however, remained silent on this matter. Whereas previously the code distinguished between orders and congregations, the code now refers simply to religious institutes.

Since the code of 1983, the Vatican has addressed the renewal of the contemplative life of nuns. It produced the letter ''Verbi Sponsa'' in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccscrlife/documents/rc_con_ccscrlife_doc_13051999_verbi-sponsa_en.html|title=Verbi Sponsa (13 May 1999)|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the apostolic constitution ''[[Vultum Dei quaerere]]'' in 2016, and the instruction ''Cor Orans'' in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccscrlife/documents/rc_con_ccscrlife_doc_20180401_cor-orans_en.html|title=“Cor Orans” – Implementing Instruction of the Apostolic Constitution "Vultum Dei quaerere" on women’s contemplative life, of the Congregation for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Societies of Apostolic Life (1 April 2018)|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "which replaced the 1999 document ''Verbi Sponsa'' and attempted to bring forward the ideas regarding contemplative life born during the Second Vatican Council".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2018/11/22/contemplative-nuns-roll-with-the-changes-under-pope-francis/|title=Contemplative nuns roll with the changes under Pope Francis|date=2018-11-22|work=Crux|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== United States ====
{{main|Catholic sisters and nuns in the United States}} Nuns and sisters played a major role in American religion, education, nursing and social work since the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. McGuinness, ''Called to Serve: A History of Nuns in America'' (2015) [https://www.amazon.com/Called-Serve-History-Nuns-America/dp/0814795579/ excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy.  There were very few rich [[American Catholics]], and no aristocrats. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 orders in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different orders by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James M. |last1=O'Toole |title=The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America |year=2008 |page=104 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=9780674034884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. McGuinness, ''Called to Serve'' (2013), ch 8&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Second Vatican Council]] the sisters have directed their ministries more to the poor, working more directly among them and with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sistersofmercy.org/spirituality/|title=Sisters of Mercy: Spirituality, Resources, Prayer and Action|website=Sisters of Mercy|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
{{main|Catholic sisters and nuns in Canada}}
Nuns have played an important role in Canada, especially in heavily Catholic Quebec. Outside the home, Canadian women had few domains which they controlled. An important exception came with Roman Catholic nuns, especially in Québec. Stimulated by the influence in France, the popular religiosity of the [[Counter Reformation]], new orders for women began appearing in the seventeenth century. In the next three centuries women opened dozens of independent religious orders, funded in part by [[Religious dower|dowries]] provided by the parents of young nuns. The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, [[maternity home|homes for unwed mothers]], and schools.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Carr, Jr., "Writing the Convent in New France: The Colonialist Rhetoric of Canadian Nuns", ''Quebec Studies'' (2009), Issue 47, pp 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Modern Spain'''

Prior to women becoming nuns during early modern Spain, aspired nuns underwent a process. The process was ensured by the [[Council of Trent]], which [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] (1556-1598) adopted within Spain.&lt;ref name="Schmitz 375–399"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Timothy J.|date=2006-01-01|title=The Spanish Hieronymites and the Reformed Texts of the Council of Trent|jstor=20477841|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=37|issue=2|pages=375–399|doi=10.2307/20477841}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Phillip II acquired the aid of the [[Hieronymites|Hieronymite order]] to ensure that monasteries abided by the decrees of the Council of Trent.&lt;ref name="Schmitz 375–399"/&gt; This changed the way in which nuns would live.&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehfeldt|first=Elizabeth A.|date=1999-01-01|title=Discipline, Vocation, and Patronage: Spanish Religious Women in a Tridentine Microclimate|jstor=2544609|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1009–1030|doi=10.2307/2544609}}&lt;/ref&gt; One edict of the Council of Trent was that female monasteries be enclosed in order to limit nuns' relationship with the secular world.&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"/&gt; Enclosure of monasteries during this time was associated with chastity.&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"/&gt; Another decree issued by the Council of Trent was that religious devotion be "true and voluntary".&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"/&gt; A male clergy member would ask the aspiring nuns if whether or not their vocation was "true and voluntary" in order to ensure no enforced conversion.&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"/&gt;

To be considered as a nun, one must have the economic means to afford the convent dowry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehfeldt|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2000-01-01|title=Convents as Litigants: Dowry and Inheritance Disputes in Early-Modern Spain|jstor=3789215|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=33|issue=3|pages=645–664}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time convent dowries were affordable, compared to secular marriages between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuns: A history of convent life, 1450-1700|last=Evangelisti|first=Silvia|publisher=Oxford ; New York : Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically during early modern Spain a large number of nuns were from elite families who had the means to afford the convent dowry and "maintenance allowances", which were annual fees.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Monasteries were economically supported through convent dowries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Convent dowries could be waived if the aspiring nun had an artistic ability benefiting the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taggard|first=Mindy Nancarrow|date=2000-01-01|title=Art and Alienation in Early Modern Spanish Convents|jstor=3201923|journal=South Atlantic Review|volume=65|issue=1|pages=24–40|doi=10.2307/3201923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an aspiring nun has entered the convent and has the economic means to afford the dowry, she undergoes the process of apprenticeship known as the novitiate period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brides of Christ: Conventual life in colonial Mexico|last=Lavrin|first=Asuncion|publisher=Stanford University Press, 2008.|year=2008|isbn=|location=Stanford, Calif. :|pages=49|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novitiate period typically lasts 1–2 years, and during this time the aspiring nun lives the life of a nun without taking the official vows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brides of Christ: Conventual life in colonial Mexico|last=Lavrin|first=Asuncion|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Stanford, Calif|pages=48|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she lives in the convent she is closely monitored by the other women in the community to determine if her vocation is genuine. This would be officially determined by a vote from the choir nuns.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; If the aspiring nun passes the scrutiny of the women of the religious community, she then can make her [[solemn vow]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Prior to making the vows, the family of the nun is expected to pay the convent dowry.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Nuns were also expected to denounce their inheritance and property rights.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Religious class distinctions:  
* Choir nuns: Usually from elite families, they held office, could vote within the convent, and were given the opportunity to read and write.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuns: A history of convent life, 1450-1700|last=Evangelisti|first=Silvia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=30|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lay-sisters: Lower class women, assigned tasks related to the labour of the convent, generally were not given the opportunities to read and write, and paid a lower dowry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodox ===
[[File:Saint Sofia of Suzdal crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Solomonia Saburova|Saint Sophia]] of [[Suzdal]], wearing the full monastic habit of a [[Schemanun]]]]
{{Main|Eastern Christian Monasticism}}

In the Eastern Orthodox Church there is no distinction between a monastery for women and one for men. In [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and other Eastern European languages, both domiciles are called "monasteries" and the ascetics who live therein are "monastics". In English, however, it is acceptable to use the terms "nun" and "convent" for clarity and convenience. The term for an abbess is the feminine form of abbot (''[[hegumen]]'') – Greek: ''hegumeni''; {{lang-sr|Игуманија }}(''Igumanija''); Russian: игумения, (''[[igumenia]]''). Orthodox monastics do not have distinct "orders" as in Western Christianity. Orthodox monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives.&lt;ref&gt;Archpriest Seraphim Slobodskoy, ''The Law of God'' (Printshop of St. Job of Pochaev, Jordanville, NY, {{ISBN|0884650448}}), p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt; There may be slight differences in the way a monastery functions internally but these are simply differences in style (Gr. ''[[typica]]'') dependent on the abbess or [[abbot]]. The abbess is the spiritual leader of the convent and her authority is absolute (no [[priest]], [[bishop]], or even [[patriarch]] can override an abbess within the walls of her monastery.) There has always been spiritual equality between men and women in the Orthodox Church ({{bibleverse||Galatians|3:28|KJV}}). Abbots and Abbesses rank in authority equal to bishops in many ways and were included in [[ecumenical council]]s. Orthodox monasteries are usually associated with a local synod of bishops by jurisdiction, but are otherwise self-governing. Abbesses hear [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s (but do not [[absolution|absolve]]) and dispense [[blessing]]s on their charges, though they still require the services of a [[presbyter]] (i.e., a priest) to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] and perform other priestly functions, such as the absolution of a penitent.

Orthodox monastics, in general have little or no contact with the outside world, especially family. The pious family whose child decides to enter the monastic profession understands that their child will become "dead to the world" and therefore be unavailable for social visits.

There are a number of different levels that the nun passes through in her profession:
{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}

*'''Novice –''' When one enters a monastery the first three to five years are spent as a [[novitiate|novice]]. Novices may or may not (depending on the abbess's wishes) dress in the black inner robe ([[cassock|Isorassa]]); those who do will also usually wear the [[apostolnik]] or a black [[scarf]] tied over the head (see photo, above). The isorassa is the first part of the monastic "[[Religious habit|habit]]" of which there is only one style for Orthodox monastics (this is true in general, there have been a few slight regional variations over the centuries, but the style always seems to precipitate back to a style common in the 3rd or 4th century). If a novice chooses to leave during the novitiate period no penalty is incurred.
*'''Rassaphore –''' When the abbess deems the novice ready, the novice is asked to join the monastery. If she accepts, she is [[tonsure]]d in a formal service during which she is given the outer robe ([[Cassock|Exorassa]]) and veil ([[Epanokamelavkion]]) to wear, and (because she is now dead to the world) receives a new name. Nuns consider themselves part of a sisterhood; however, tonsured nuns are usually addressed as "Mother" (in some convents, the title of "Mother" is reserved to those who enter into the next level of Stavrophore).
*'''Stavrophore –''' The next level for monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbess feels the nun has reached a level of discipline, dedication, and [[humility]]. Once again, in a formal service the nun is elevated to the "Little Schema" which is signified by additions to her habit of certain symbolic articles of clothing. In addition, the abbess increases the nun’s [[prayer rule]], she is allowed a stricter personal ascetic practice.
*'''Great Schema –''' The final stage, called "Megaloschemos" or "[[Great Schema]]" is reached by nuns whose Abbess feels they have reached a high level of excellence. In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.

=== Protestantism ===
[[Image:Monastery Ebstorf.jpg|thumb|[[Ebstorf Abbey]] continued as a Lutheran convent in the Benedictine tradition since 1529.]]
After the Protestant Reformation, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] near [[Negenborn]] and [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Rehburg-Loccum]]) and convents (such as [[Ebstorf Abbey]] near the town of [[Uelzen]] and [[Bursfelde Abbey]] in [[Bursfelde]]) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/kloster-ebstorf-convent-bad-bevensen-near-luneburg/|title=Kloster Ebstorf|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Medieval Histories|language=English|accessdate=20 November 2017|quote=The monastery is mentioned for the first time in 1197. It belongs to the group of so-called Lüneklöstern (monasteries of Lüne), which became Lutheran convents following the Protestant Reformation. […] It is currently one of several Lutheran convents maintained by the Monastic Chamber of Hanover (Klosterkammer Hannover), an institution of the former Kingdom of Hanover founded by its Prince-Regent, later King George IV of the United Kingdom, in 1818, in order to manage and preserve the estates of Lutheran convents.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other convents, especially those in Reformed areas, closed after the Reformation, with some sisters deciding to marry.

A modern resurgence of the early Christian [[Deaconess]] office for women began in Germany in the 1840s and spread through Scandinavia, Britain and the United States, with some elements of the religious life, such as simple vows, and a daily obligation of prayer. Lutherans were especially active, and within both Lutheranism and Anglicanism some Deaconesses formed religious communities, with community living, and the option of life vows in religion.&lt;ref&gt;See CSA history [http://anglicanhistory.org/women/rich_deaconesses1907/ here].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern movement reached a zenith about 1910, then slowly declined as secularization undercut religiosity in Europe, and the professionalization of nursing and social work offered better career opportunities for young women. A small movement still exists, and its legacy is seen in the names of numerous hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Jurisson,  "The Deaconess Movement", in Rosemary Skinner Keller et al., eds. ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America'' (Indiana U.P., 2006). pp. 821-33 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WPILfbtT5tQC&amp;pg=PA821 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of the Deaconess communities eventually led to the establishment of religious communities of monks and nuns within some Protestant traditions,&lt;ref&gt;One example of a Protestant [http://www.lutheranfranciscans.org/Home.html religious order] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716185753/http://www.lutheranfranciscans.org/Home.html |date=2014-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those influenced by the more liturgical Protestant reformers (such as [[Martin Luther]]) rather than the more extreme reformers (such as [[John Calvin]]). This has allowed for communities of nuns (or, in some cases, mixed communities of nuns and monks) to be re-established in some Protestant traditions. Many of these are within the episcopal Lutheran tradition and the closeness of Lutheranism with Anglicanism its belief and practice has led to local arrangements of inter-Communion between the two traditions, such as the [[Porvoo Communion]].&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;Israeli press report concerning one [http://www.timesofisrael.com/lutheran-nuns-end-jerusalem-mission-to-shoah-survivors/ German Lutheran order] of nuns.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anglicanism ====
{{main|Anglican religious order}}
Religious communities throughout England were destroyed by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] when he separated the [[Church of England]] from papal authority during the [[English Reformation]] (see [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]). Monasteries and convents were deprived of their lands and possessions, and monastics were forced to either live a secular life on a pension or flee the country.  Many Roman Catholic nuns went to France.

[[File:Julianofnorwich.jpg|thumb|Two Anglican nuns]]
Anglican religious orders are organizations of [[laity]] or clergy in the [[Anglican Communion]] who live under a common rule. The term "religious orders" is distinguished from [[Holy Orders]] (the sacrament of [[ordination]] which bishops, priests, and deacons receive), though many communities do have ordained members.

The structure and function of religious orders in Anglicanism roughly parallels that which exists in Roman Catholicism. Religious communities are divided into orders proper, in which members take solemn vows and congregations, whose members take simple vows.

With the rise of the [[Oxford Movement]] in Anglicanism in the early 19th century came interest in the revival of "religious life" in England. Between 1841 and 1855, several religious orders for nuns were founded, among them the Community of St. Mary at [[Wantage]] and the Community of St. Margaret at [[East Grinstead]].

In the United States and Canada, the founding of Anglican religious orders of nuns began in 1845 with the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion (now defunct) in New York.

Whilst there is no single central authority for all religious orders, and many member churches of the Anglican Communion have their own internal structures for recognising and regulating religious orders, some central functions are performed by the Anglican Religious Communities Department at [[Church House, Westminster]], the headquarters of the Church of England's [[Church Commissioners]], [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]], [[Archbishops' Council]], and [[National Society for Promoting Religious Education|National Society]]. This department publishes the bi-annual ''Anglican Religious Life'', a world directory of religious orders, and also maintains an official Anglican Communion website for religious orders. ''Anglican Religious Life'' defines four categories of community.&lt;ref&gt;Anglican Religious Life 2012-13, published Canterbury Press, Norwich, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84825-089-5}}, pp. iii, iv, 19, 147, 151, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Traditional celibate religious orders and communities": Members take a vow of celibacy (amongst other vows) and follow a common Rule of life. They may be enclosed and contemplative or open and engaged in apostolic works.
* "Dispersed communities": These are orders or communities whose members, whilst taking vows (including celibacy), do not live together in community. In most cases the members are self-supporting and live alone, but follow the same Rule of life, and meet together frequently in assemblies often known as 'Chapter meetings'. In some cases some members may share a common life in very small groups of two or three.
* "Acknowledged communities": These communities live a traditional Christian life, including the taking of vows, but the traditional vows are adapted or changed. In many cases these communities admit both single and married persons as members, requiring celibacy on the part of those who are single, and unfailing commitment to their spouse on the part of married members. They also amend the vow of poverty, allowing personal possessions, but requiring high standards of tithing to the community and the wider church. These communities often have residential elements, but not full residential community life, as this would be incompatible with some elements of married family life.
* "Other communities": This group contains communities that are ecumenical (including Anglicans) or that belong to non-Anglican churches that have entered into relationships of full communion with the Anglican Church (particularly, but not only, certain Lutheran churches).

In the United States (only), there is a clear distinction between "orders" and "communities", as the Episcopal Church has its own two-fold definition of "religious orders" (equivalent to the first two groups above) and "Christian communities" (equivalent to the third group above).&lt;ref&gt;See Title III, Canon 24, sections 1 and 2 of the Canons of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, also quoted at [http://communities.anglicancommunion.org Anglican Communion Religious Communities].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Anglican Religious Life'' directory affirms this, stating "This distinction in not used in other parts of the Anglican Communion where 'communities' is also used for those who take traditional vows."&lt;ref&gt;''Anglican Religious Life 2012-13'', Canterbury Press, Norwich, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84825-089-5}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kloster Bursfelde von NO.jpg|thumb|[[Bursfelde Abbey]] has continued as a Lutheran convent since A.D. 1579]]

In some Anglican orders, there are sisters who have been ordained and can celebrate the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmbos.com/Pages/whatwedo.html What We Do] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616160844/http://www.ssmbos.com/Pages/whatwedo.html |date=2010-06-16 }} sisters of St. Margaret, (Episcopal religious community of women)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lutheranism ====
There are a plethora of religious orders within the [[Lutheran Church]]es, such as the [[Order of Lutheran Franciscans]] and [[Daughters of Mary (Lutheran)|Daughters of Mary]].

The [[Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary]], an order of Lutheran nuns, operates a guesthouse for Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="TOI"/&gt;

==== Methodism ====

==In popular culture==
{{example farm|date=November 2013}}

Nuns play an important role in the public's image of religious symbolism. A list of notable works in which nuns play a major part ranges from ''[[A Time for Miracles]]'', which is [[hagiography]], to realistic accounts by [[Kathryn Hulme]] and [[Monica Baldwin]], to the blatant [[nunsploitation]] of ''[[Sacred Flesh]]''. Works can include those which portray Catholic nuns or non-Catholic such as ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (Anglican), and ''[[Minsara Kanavu]]''  (church of south India).

Many stories that have depicted nuns have gone on to critical and audience acclaim such as ''[[Sister Act]]'', ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. These stories have been reproduced in both stage and film. Other examples of nuns in television and film include [[Sally Field]] in ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', [[Stephanie Beacham]] in ''[[Sister Kate (TV series)|Sister Kate]]'' and [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]''. Miss Clavel in the ''Madeline'' books and TV series is the nun of a French catholic boarding school.

Nuns have been used as antagonists in stories including [[Jessica Lange]] as Sister Jude in ''[[American Horror Story]]'' or [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]''.

{{Prayer}}
'''Prayer''' is an [[invocation]] or act that seeks to activate a [[rapport]] with an object of [[worship]], typically a [[deity]],  through deliberate [[communication]]. In the narrow sense, the term refers to an act of [[supplication]] or [[intercession]] directed towards a [[deity]], or a deified [[ancestor worship|ancestor]]. More generally, prayer can also have the purpose of [[thanksgiving]] or [[praise]], and in [[comparative religion]] is closely associated with more abstract forms of [[meditation]] and with [[Incantation|charms or spells]].&lt;ref&gt;F.B. Jevons, '''An Introduction to the Study of Comparative Religion'' (1908), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HgddDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73  p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set [[liturgy]] or [[ritual]], and it can be performed alone or in groups. Prayer may take the form of a [[hymn]], [[incantation]], formal [[creed]]al statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person.

Today, most major [[religion]]s involve prayer in one way or another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practised spontaneously by anyone at any time.

==Etymology==
The English term ''prayer'' is from  [[Medieval Latin]] ''precaria'' "petition, prayer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=pray (v.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pray|website=etymonline.com|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=30 December 2014}}
Via Old French ''prier'', nominalised use of the Latin adjective ''precaria'' "something obtained by entreating, something given as a favour", from ''precari'' "to ask for, entreat".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vulgate]] Latin is ''[[:wikt:oratio|oratio]]'', which translates Greek [[:wikt:προσευχή|προσευχή]]&lt;ref&gt;Biblical synonyms or alternatives for προσευχή: εὐχή, δέησις, ἔντευξις, εὐχαριστία, αἴτημα, ἱκετηρία. Richard C. Trench, Synonyms of the New Testament, s.v. [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/trench/section.cfm?sectionID=51 εὐχή].&lt;/ref&gt; in turn the  [[Septuagint]] translation  of [[Biblical Hebrew]] {{lang|he|[[:wikt:תפילה|תְּפִלָּה]]}} ''tĕphillah''.&lt;ref&gt;''Strong's Concordance'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8605&amp;t=KJV H8605].&lt;/ref&gt;

Various spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, [[Grace (prayer)|graces said over meals]], and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] regard dancing as a form of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Littlebird |first= Sarracina|title= Sacred Movement: Dance as Prayer in the Pueblo Cultures of the American Southwest |publisher= Barnard College Department of Dance |year= 2008 |url= http://dance.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/sarracina_littlebird.pdf |accessdate= 11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Sufism|Sufis]] [[Sufi whirling|whirl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi – Sufism and Dervishes |url= http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm |work= WhirlingDervishes.org |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104195830/http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm |archivedate= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindus chant mantras.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Omkarananda |first= Swami |title= How to Pray |publisher= Omkarananda Ashram Himalayas |date= n.d.  |url= http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Publications/how_to_pray.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104195625/http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Publications/how_to_pray.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish prayer may involve [[Shuckling|swaying]] back and forth and bowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Judaism: Jewish Rituals and Practices – Jewish Worship and Prayer |work= ReligionFacts.com |publisher= ReligionFacts |author= Anonymous |date= 2013-07-03 |url= http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/practices/worship_prayer.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104200647/http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/practices/worship_prayer.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}. This practice is known, in [[Yiddish]], as ''shuckling''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslims]] practice ''[[salat]]'' (kneeling and [[prostration]]) in their prayers. Quakers keep silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Avery|first=Chel|title=Quaker Worship|publisher=Quaker Information Center| url = http://www.quakerinfo.org/quakerism/worship.html|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pray according to standardized rituals and liturgies, while others prefer extemporaneous prayers. Still others combine the two.

[[Friedrich Heiler]] is often cited in Christian circles for his systematic ''Typology of Prayer'' which lists six types of prayer: primitive, ritual, Greek cultural, philosophical, mystical, and prophetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erickson, Millard J.|title=Christian theology|publisher=Baker Book House|location=Grand Rapids|year=1998|isbn=0-8010-2182-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of prayer require a prior ritualistic form of cleansing or purification such as in [[ghusl]] and [[wudhu]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopedia of Islam - Page 20, Cyril Glassé - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Prayer may be done privately and individually, or it may be done corporately in the presence of fellow believers. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily "thought life", in which one is in constant communication with a god. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses. This is actually regarded as a requirement in several Christian denominations,&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{Catholic |last= Wynne |first= John |volume= 12 |title= Prayer |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm |no-icon= 1 |prescript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although enforcement is not possible nor desirable. There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to interpret an answer to a question, if there in fact comes an answer.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; Some may experience audible, physical, or mental epiphanies. If indeed an answer comes, the time and place it comes is considered random.
Some outward acts that sometimes accompany prayer are: anointing with oil;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{bibleverse||James|5:14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; ringing a bell;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheckel|first=Roger J.|title=The Angelus| publisher = The Marian Catechists|date=January 2004|url= http://www.mariancatechist.com/html/spiritualdevelopment/prayer/sanctifyingyourdaywiththeangelus.htm|accessdate=2008-10-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080623093915/http://www.mariancatechist.com/html/spiritualdevelopment/prayer/sanctifyingyourdaywiththeangelus.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; burning incense or paper;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhist Art|publisher=Pacific Asia Museum|year=2003|url=http://www.pacificasiamuseum.org/buddhism/html/essay4.htm|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704073342/http://www.pacificasiamuseum.org/buddhism/html/essay4.htm|archivedate=2008-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; lighting a candle or candles; See, for example, facing a specific direction (i.e. towards [[Mecca]]&lt;ref name=Emerick&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerick|first=Yahiya| authorlink=Yahiya Emerick|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Islam|publisher=Alpha Books|year=2002|location= Indianapolis IN|pages=127–28|url=http://www.idiotsguides.com|isbn=0-02-864233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the East); making the [[sign of the cross]]. One less noticeable act related to prayer is [[fasting]].

A variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.

==Origins and early history==

[[File:Praying Germanic man 1890.jpg|thumb|A kneeling position with raised hands expressed "supplication" in classical antiquity. The word for "prayer" and for "supplication" is identical in ancient languages (''oratio'', προσευχή,  תְּפִלָּה etc.), with no terminological distinction between supplications addressed to human as opposed to divine powers.
Statuette known as "Praying German" or "supplicating barbarian". It is not known if this figure was originally set in a context of religious prayer or of military surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Image from [https://archive.org/details/artscraftsofourt00brow "The arts and crafts of our Teutonic forefathers"] by G. B. Brown (1910), where it is glossed as "Bronze figure of a German, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris". "the existence of other bronze barbarians in similar attitudes of prayer and subjection suggests that the composition was a popular one" (Melissa Barden Dowling, Clemency and cruelty in the Roman world, 2006, p. 151)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Anthropologically, the concept of prayer is closely related to that of [[Submission|surrender]] and [[supplication]]. 
The traditional posture of prayer in medieval Europe is kneeling or supine with clasped hands, in antiquity more typically with raised hands. The early Christian prayer posture was standing, looking up to heaven, with outspread arms and bare head. This is the pre-Christian, pagan prayer posture (except for the bare head, which was prescribed for males in Corinthians 11:4, in Roman paganism, the head had to be covered in prayer). Certain Cretan and Cypriote figures of the Late Bronze Age, with arms raised, have been interpreted as worshippers. Their posture is similar to the "flight" posture, a crouching posture with raised hands, observed in schizophrenic patients and related to the universal [[list of gestures|"hands up" gesture]] of surrender. The kneeling posture with clasped hands appears to have been introduced only with the beginning high medieval period, presumably adopted from a gesture of feudal homage.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Claire; Russell, W.M.S. (1989). "Cultural Evolution of Behaviour". Netherlands Journal of Zoology. 40 (4): 745–762 (756f.). doi:10.1163/156854290X00190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although prayer in its literal sense is not used in [[animism]], communication with the spirit world is vital to the animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a [[shaman]] who, through a [[trance]], gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits' thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using [[astrology]] or contemplating [[Fortune telling|fortune tellers]] and healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omf.org/omf/cambodia/about_cambodia/animism_profile|publisher=OMF|title=Animism Profile in Cambodia|accessdate=2008-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912124231/http://www.omf.org/omf/cambodia/about_cambodia/animism_profile|archivedate=2007-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the oldest extant literature, such as the Sumerian temple hymns of [[Enheduanna]] (c. 23th century BC) are liturgy addressed to deities and thus technically "prayer". The Egyptian [[Pyramid Texts]] of about the same period similarly contain spells or incantations addressed to the gods. In the loosest sense, in the form of [[magical thinking]] combined with [[animism]], prayer has been argued as representing a [[human cultural universal]], which would have been present since the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]], by [[anthropology|anthropologists]]  such as Sir [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and Sir [[James George Frazer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Zaleski, Carol |author2=Zaleski, Philip |title=Prayer: A History|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|year=2006|pages=24–25|isbn=0-618-77360-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliable records are available for the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions of the [[Iron Age]], most notably [[Ancient Greek religion]] (which strongly influenced [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]). These religious traditions were direct developments of the earlier [[Prehistoric religion#Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age religions]].
Ceremonial prayer was highly formulaic and [[ritual]]ized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayor|first=Diane|title=The Homeric Hymns| publisher=University of California Press|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9232/9232.intro.php| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religio Romana|publisher=Nova Roma|url=http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/posture.html|accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ancient polytheism, [[ancestor worship]] is indistinguishable from theistic worship (see also [[Euhemerism]]).
Vestiges of ancestor worship persist, to a greater or lesser extent, in modern religious traditions throughout the world, most notably in Japanese [[Shinto]] and in [[Chinese ancestor worship|Chinese folk religion]]. The practices involved in [[Shinto]] prayer are heavily influenced by Buddhism; [[Japanese Buddhism]] has also been strongly influenced by Shinto in turn.  Shinto prayers quite frequently consist of wishes or favors asked of the ''[[kami]]'', rather than lengthy praises or devotions. The practice of [[votive offering]] is also universal, and is attested at least since the Bronze Age. In Shinto, this takes the form of a small wooden tablet, called an ''[[ema (Shintō)|ema]]''.

Prayers in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] were used in the Roman world by [[augur]]s and other [[oracle]]s long after Etruscan became a dead language. The [[Carmen Arvale]] and the [[Carmen Saliare]] are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes, and whose language is full of [[archaism]]s and difficult passages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic de Forest Allen]], ''Remnants of Early Latin'' (Boston: Ginn &amp; Heath 1880 and Ginn &amp; Co 1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman prayers and [[sacrifice]]s were often envisioned as [[religious law|legal]] bargains between deity and worshipper. The Roman principle was expressed as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#do ut des|do ut des]]'': "I give, so that you may give." [[Cato the Elder]]'s treatise on [[agriculture]] contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s Mars Prayer, found in ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' (141), English translation at: {{citation |url= http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-texts/Mars-prayer.html |contribution= Cato's Mars Prayer |title= Indo-European Texts: Old Latin |editor1= Jonathan Slocum |editor2= Carol Justus |date= 13 May 2014 |publisher= [[Linguistics Research Center at UT Austin]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060903231425/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-texts/Mars-prayer.html |archivedate= 3 September 2006 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdrífa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''; Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]
[[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]], [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] and [[Slavic paganism|Slavic]] religions are recorded much later, and much more fragmentarily, than the religions of classical antiquity. They nevertheless show substantial parallels to the better-attested religions of the Iron Age. In the case of Germanic religion, the practice of prayer is reliably attested, but no actual liturgy is recorded from the early (Roman era) period. An Old Norse prayer is on record in the form of a dramatization in [[skaldic poetry]]. This prayer is recorded in stanzas 2 and 3 of the poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', compiled in the 13th century ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' from earlier traditional sources, where the [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdrífa]] prays to the gods and the [[Jörð|earth]] after being woken by the hero [[Sigurd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe25.htm|title=The Poetic Edda: Sigrdrifumol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A prayer to [[Odin]] is mentioned in chapter 2 of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' where King [[Rerir]] prays for a child.   In stanza 9 of the poem ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'', a prayer is made to "kind [[Vættir|wights]], Frigg and [[Freyja]], and many gods&lt;ref&gt;"although since the poem is often considered one of the youngest poems in the Poetic Edda, the passage has been the matter of some debate." [[Stephan Grundy|Grundy, Stephan]] (1998). "Freyja and Frigg" as collected in Billington, Sandra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover The Concept of the Goddess]'', p. 60. [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-19789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 21 of ''[[Jómsvíkinga saga]]'', wishing to turn the tide of the [[Battle of Hjörungavágr]], [[Haakon Sigurdsson]] eventually finds his prayers answered by the goddesses [[Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa]].&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER100&gt;Hollander, Lee (trans.) (1955). ''The saga of the Jómsvíkings'', p. 100. [[University of Texas Press]] {{ISBN|0-292-77623-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Folk religion]] in the medieval period produced [[syncretism]]s between pre-Christian and Christian traditions. An example is the 11th-century [[Anglo-Saxon]] charm ''[[Æcerbot]]'' for the  fertility of crops and land, or the medical ''[[Wið færstice]]''.&lt;ref name=GORDON88-90&gt;[[Gordon, R. K.]] (1962).

Dent &amp; Sons, LTD.&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th-century [[Wessobrunn Prayer]] has been proposed as a Christianized pagan prayer and compared to the pagan ''[[Völuspá]]''&lt;ref name=LAMBDIN227&gt;Lambdin, Laura C and Robert T.

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], prayers to the "Great Wit" are performed by the "clever men" and "clever women", or ''kadji''. These [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] shamans use [[maban]] or mabain, the material that is believed to give them their purported magical powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elkin|first=Adolphus P.|title=Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition|publisher=Inner Traditions - Bear &amp; Company|year=1973|isbn=0-89281-421-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] Indians are known to have used [[prayer stick]]s, that is, sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings. The [[Hopi]] Indians used prayer sticks as well, but they attached to it a small bag of sacred meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Prayer stick|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to prayer==
{{bias|bias=Judeo-Christian views and religions|date=May 2018}}

===Direct petitions===
The most common form of prayer is to directly appeal to a deity to grant one's requests.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Some have termed this as the social approach to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Moshe. Biblical Prose Prayer: As a Window to the Popular Religion of Ancient Israel. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1983 [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft8b69p1w7/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheist]] arguments against prayer are mostly directed against [[Supplication|petitionary prayer]] in particular. [[Daniel Dennett]] argued that petitionary prayer might have the undesirable psychological effect of relieving a person of the need to take active measures.&lt;ref&gt;"Surely it does the world no harm if those who can honestly do so pray for me!

This potential drawback manifests in extreme forms in such cases as [[Christian Scientists]] who rely on prayers instead of seeking medical treatment for family members for easily curable conditions which later result in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/06/us/in-child-deaths-a-test-for-christian-science.html?pagewanted=all |title= In Child Deaths, a Test for Christian Science |first= David |last= Margolick |date= 6 August 1990 |newspaper= The New York Times |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104202219/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/06/us/in-child-deaths-a-test-for-christian-science.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] (2012) argued that praying to a god which is omnipotent and all-knowing would be presumptuous. For example, he interprets [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s definition of prayer by stating that "the man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who also thinks that he can instruct god how to put them right."&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2012 n.p"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Mortality (book)|Mortality]] |last= Hitchens |first= Christopher |authorlink= Christopher Hitchens |year= 2012 |publisher= Twelve |place= New York |isbn= 9781455502752 |oclc= 776526158 |page= }}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational approach===
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] [[Siddur]] (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII).

Among Christian theologians, [[Edward McKendree Bounds|E.M. Bounds]] stated the educational purpose of prayer in every chapter of his book, ''The Necessity of Prayer''. Prayer books such as the [[Book of Common Prayer]] are both a result of this approach and an exhortation to keep it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bounds|first=Edward McKendree|title=The Necessity of Prayer|publisher=AGES Software|year=1907|isbn=0-8010-0659-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalist approach===
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation ([[meditation]]). This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher [[Maimonides]] &lt;ref&gt;Guide to the Perplexed 3:51&lt;/ref&gt; and the other medieval rationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Ha'Ikarim 4:18&lt;/ref&gt; It became popular in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths. In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority of people still hold to this approach.

===Experiential approach===
[[File:Theophile Lybaert - Old Flanders.jpeg|thumb|''Old woman praying'' by [[Théophile Lybaert]]]]
In this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], this approach is known as [[hesychasm]]. It is also widespread in [[Sufi]] Islam, and in some forms of [[mysticism]]. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve [[contemplation]], although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual.  Christian and Roman Catholic traditions also include an experiential approach to prayer within the practice of [[Lectio Divina]], historically a [[Benedictine]] practice in which scripture is read aloud; actively meditated upon using the intellect (but not analysis) possibly using the mind to place the listener within a relationship or dialogue with the text that was read; a prayer spoken; and finally concludes with [[Lectio Divina#Contemplatio: contemplate|contemplation]], a more passive experiential approach than the previous meditation, which is characterized by the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] as an experience of consciously being attentive, and having a silent love toward God, which the individual experiences without demanding to receive an experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Expressions of prayer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of God within [[Apophatic theology|Christian mysticism]] has been contrasted with the concept of experiential religion or [[Religious experience|mystical experience]] because of a long history or authors living and writing about experience with the divine in a manner that identifies God as unknowable and ineffable, the language of such ideas could be characterized paradoxically as "experiential", as well as without the phenomena of experience.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness of God: Negativity in Christian Mysticism'' by Denys Turner 1998 Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521645611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used a term called "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{Citation not found}} The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.

In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that [[Moral obligation|moral experience]] justified [[religious belief]]s, [[John Wesley]] in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the [[Methodist movement]] (paralleling the [[Romantic Movement]]) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in Science and Religion, [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 68, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher and [[Albrecht Ritschl|Albert Ritschl]] to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies [[religious belief]]s.

Such religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was&amp;nbsp;— during the period in-between world wars&amp;nbsp;— famously rejected by [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 114, 116-119&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] view are [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Raven]] and the Oxford physicist/theologian [[Charles Coulson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, p. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "religious experience" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of whom William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{Citation not found}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}}{{Citation not found}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}}{{Citation not found}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{Citation not found}}}}

===Hebrew Bible===
{{Main|Prayer in the Hebrew Bible}}
In the Hebrew Bible prayer is an evolving means of interacting with [[God]], most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, although beginning in [[Deuteronomy]], the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer, including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible's later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the [[Tefillah|form practiced]] by modern [[Jews]].

Individual prayer is described by the Tanakh two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's prayer is given. In these instances, such as with [[Isaac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%2025:21&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 25: 21 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2011:2&amp;version=NIV |title=Num. 11:2 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel+8:6&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Samuel 8:6 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+42:10&amp;version=NIV |title=Job. 42:10 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] to [[Hezekiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, "Prayer," http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=496&amp;letter=P&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
{{Main|Prayer in the New Testament}}
In the New Testament prayer is presented as a positive command ({{bibleverse||Colossians|4:2}}; {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:17}}). The [[People of God]] are challenged to include [[Christian prayer]] in their everyday life, even in the busy struggles of marriage ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:5}}) as it brings people closer to [[God in Christianity|God]].

[[Jesus]] encouraged his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray in secret in their private rooms, using the [[Lord's Prayer]], as a humble response to the prayer of the [[Pharisees]], whose practices in prayer were regarded as impious by the New Testament writers ({{bibleverse||Matthew|6:6}}).

Throughout the [[New Testament]], prayer is shown to be God's appointed method by which we obtain what He has to bestow ({{bibleverse||Matthew|7:7-11}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:24-29}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|11:13}}. Further, the [[Book of James]] says that the lack of [[blessing]]s in life results from a failure to pray ({{bibleverse||James|4:2}}). Jesus healed through prayer and expected his followers to do so also ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:17-18}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:8}}).

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish prayer}}
[[File:Jewish Canadian soldiers during WWII.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Captain Samuel Cass, a [[rabbi]], conducting the first prayer service celebrated on German territory by Jewish personnel of the [[First Canadian Army]] near [[Kleve|Cleve]], Germany, 18 March 1945]]
Observant Jews pray three times a day, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Ma'ariv]] with lengthier prayers on special days, such as the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]] including [[Musaf]] and the reading of the [[Torah]]. The [[siddur]] is the prayerbook used by Jews all over the world, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: ''[[kavanah]]'' (intention) and ''keva'' (the ritualistic, structured elements).

The most important Jewish prayers are the [[Shema Yisrael]] ("Hear O Israel") and the [[Amidah]] ("the standing prayer").

Communal prayer is preferred over solitary prayer, and a quorum of 10 adult males (a ''[[minyan]]'') is considered by [[Orthodox Judaism]] a prerequisite for several communal prayers.
[[File:Muro de las Lamentaciones, Jerusalén, Israel, 2017.gif|thumb|[[Orthodox Jewish]] men praying in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall]]]]

There are also many other ritualistic prayers a Jew performs during their day, such as washing before eating bread, washing after one wakes up in the morning, and doing grace after meals.

====Rationalist approach====
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists. One example of this approach to prayer is noted by Rabbi Steven Weil, who was appointed the Orthodox Union's Executive-Vice President in 2009. He notes that the word "prayer" is a derivative of the Latin "precari", which means "to beg". The Hebrew equivalent "tefilah", however, along with its root "pelel" or its reflexive "l’hitpallel", means the act of self-analysis or self-evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ou.org/torah/article/why_tefilah_doesn |title= Why Tefilah Doesn't Mean Prayer: Redefining our Relationship with G-d |first= Steven |last= Weil |authorlink= Steven Weil |date= September 14, 2010 |type= video presentation |work= ou.org |publisher= [[Orthodox Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is sometimes described as the person praying having a dialogue or conversation with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/862508/jewish/Talking-With-Gd.htm |first= Naftali |last= Silberberg |date= n.d. |title= Jewish Practice " Mitzvahs &amp; Traditions " Prayer " Insights – Talking With G‑d |work= [[Chabad.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational approach====
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, [[Yehuda Halevy]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph Dov Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] Siddur (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).

====Kabbalistic approach====
[[Kabbalah]] uses a series of ''[[Kavanah|kavanot]]'', directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/114937/jewish/The-Kabbalah.htm The Kabbalah of Prayer] on Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Jews, this approach has been taken by the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]] (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the [[Isaac Luria|Arizal's]] Kabbalist tradition, [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramchal]], most of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]], the [[Vilna Gaon]], and [[Jacob Emden]].

Christian prayers are quite varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The most common prayer among Christians is the [[Lord's Prayer]], which according to the [[gospel]] accounts (e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#6:9|Matthew 6:9–13]]) is how [[Jesus]] taught his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 &gt;''Examining Religions: Christianity Foundation Edition'' by Anne Geldart 1999 {{ISBN|0-435-30324-4}} page 108&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord's Prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 /&gt; In medieval England, prayers (particularly the ''[[Lord's Prayer|paternoster]]'') were frequently used as a measure of time in medical and culinary recipe books.&lt;ref&gt;Irma Taavitsainen, 'Middle English Recipes: Genre Characteristics, Text Type Features and Underlying Traditions of Writing', ''Journal of Historical Pragmatics'', 2 (2001), 85–113 (p. 103), DOI: 10.1075/jhp.2.1.05taa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians generally pray to God or to the Father. Some Christians (e.g., [[Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]) will also ask the righteous in heaven and "in Christ," such as [[Virgin Mary]] or other saints to intercede by praying on their behalf ([[intercession of saints]]). Formulaic closures include "through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all the ages of ages," and "in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

It is customary among Protestants to end prayers with "In [[Jesus]]' name, Amen" or "In the name of [[Christ]], Amen."&lt;ref&gt;See John 16:23, 26; John 14:13; John 15:16&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most commonly used closure in Christianity is simply "[[Amen]]" (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement, usually translated as ''so be it'').

In the Western or [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], probably the most common is the [[Rosary]]; In the Eastern Church (the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern rites]] of the Catholic Church and Orthodox Church), the [[Jesus Prayer]]. The Jesus Prayer is also often repeated as part of the [[Christian meditation|meditative]] [[hesychasm]] practice in [[Eastern Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Ken; David Melling (editors) (1999). ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'' {{ISBN|0-631-23203-6}} page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as [[acts of reparation]] which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins of others, e.g. for the [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|repair of the sin of blasphemy]] performed by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic |last= Slater |first= Thomas |volume= 12 |title= Reparation |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm |no-icon= 1 |prescript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of prayer among Catholics would be meditative prayer, contemplative prayer and infused prayer discussed at length by Catholic Saints St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Jesus.

====Pentecostalism====
In [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations, prayer is often accompanied by speaking in an unknown tongue, a practice now known as [[glossolalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Pentecostal glossolalia may claim that the languages they speak in prayer are real foreign languages, and that the ability to speak those languages spontaneously is a gift of the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Library - Religion – Christianity - Pentecostalism |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Company |url= http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104194445/http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|2:1-13|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|10:45-47|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people outside of the movement, however, have offered dissenting views. [[George Barton Cutten]] suggested that glossolalia was a sign of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;George Barton Cutten, ''Speaking with Tongues Historically and Psychologically Considered'', Yale University Press, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felicitas Goodman]] suggested that tongue speakers were under a form of hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Felicitas D., ''Speaking in Tongues: A Cross-Cultural Study in Glossolalia''. University of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that it is a learned behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.'

''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'': 1979 Aug Vol 88(4) 427–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
[[Christian Science]] teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Baker Eddy]], "Prayer," in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Boston, Trustees Under the Will of Mary Baker Eddy, 1934 [etc.]pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Scientists do not practice [[intercessory prayer]] as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. Prayer works through [[love]]: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Christian Science Q&amp;A|title=Is there no intercessory prayer?|url=http://www.christianscience.org/QAIsthereintercesprayer.html|accessdate=2007-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/19990830121655/http://www.christianscience.org/QAIsthereintercesprayer.html|archivedate=1999-08-30|df=}}

===Islam===
{{Main|Salat|Dua}}
[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|Muslims in prostration in [[Syria]] (2003 photograph).]]
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for prayer is ''[[salah]]''. In Islam, there are five daily obligatory prayers that are considered as one of the pillars of the religion. The command to ritual prayer occurs repeatedly in the [[Quran]]. The prayer is performed by the person while they are facing the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. There is the "call for prayer" (''[[adhan]]''), where the ''[[muezzin]]'' calls for all the followers to stand together for the prayer. The prayer consists of actions such as glorifying and praising God (such as mentioning ‘Allāhu Akbar’ (God is Great)) while standing, recitation of chapters of the Quran (such as the opening chapter of the book (''[[Al-Fatiha]]'')), [[Ruku|bowing down]] then praising God, [[prostration|prostrating]] (''[[sujud]]'') then again praising God and it ends with the words: "Peace be with you and God’s mercy". During the prayer, a Muslim cannot talk or do anything else besides pray. Once the prayer is complete, one can offer personal prayers or supplications to God for their needs that are known as ''[[dua]]''. There are many standard invocations in [[Arabic]] to be recited at various times (''e.g.'' after the prayer) and for various occasions (''e.g.'' for one's parents) with manners and etiquette such as before eating. Muslims may also say ''dua'' in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers.&lt;ref name="Emerick" /&gt; Certain [[Shi'a]] sects pray the five daily prayers divided into three separate parts of the day, providing several Hadith as supporting evidence;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UlaBw3MUGBEC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=shia+pray+3+times&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=urkrTeT9MM6IhQeAwrydCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Muslim cultures today: a reference guide] By Kathryn M.

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Báb]], and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] wrote many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others. [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s are also required to recite each day one of three [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayers]] composed by Bahá'u'lláh. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the [[Qiblih]] when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. Bahá'ís also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=P.|year=1999|title =A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford, UK|pages=274–75|isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the repetition of [[mantra]]s is closely related to the practice of repetitive prayer in Western religion ([[rosary]], [[Jesus prayer]]). Many of the most widespread Hindu and Buddhist mantras are in origin invocations of deities, e.g. [[Gayatri Mantra]] dedicated to [[Savitr]], [[Pavamana Mantra]] to [[Soma (drink)|Soma Pavamana]], and many of the Buddhist [[Dhāraṇī]] originate as recitations of lists of names or attributes of deities. Most of the shorter Buddhist mantras originate as the invocation of the name of a specific deity or ''[[bodhisattva]]'', such as ''[[Om mani padme hum]]'' being in origin the invocation of a ''bodhisattva'' called ''Maṇipadma''. However, from an early time these mantras were interpreted in the context of mystical [[sound symbolism]]. The most extreme example of this is the [[om]] syllable, which as early as in the [[Aitareya Brahmana]] was claimed as equivalent to the entire [[Vedas]] (collection of ritual hymns).&lt;ref&gt;Aitareya Brahmana 5.32, Arthur Berriedale Keith, ''The Aitareya and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda''. Harvard University Press, 1920, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Incense-LE.jpg|thumb|Buddhists praying with incense at [[Wat Phra Kaew]], Thailand]]
In the earliest Buddhist tradition, the [[Theravada]], and in the later [[Mahayana]] tradition of [[Zen]] (or [[Chán]]), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Collins|first=Steven|title=Selfless Persons|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1982|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=6|isbn=0-521-39726-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote needed|date=June 2018}}

The [[Upāya|skillful means]] (Sanskrit: ''upāya'') of the transfer of merit (Sanskrit: ''[[pariṇāmanā]]'') is an [[evocation]] and prayer. Moreover, indeterminate buddhas are available for intercession as they reside in awoken-fields (Sanskrit: ''buddha-kshetra'').

The ''[[Trikaya|nirmānakāya]]'' of an awoken-field is what is generally known and understood as a [[mandala]]. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: ''maṇḍala'') is an active prayer. An active prayer is a mindful activity, an activity in which [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] is not just cultivated but ''is''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangharakshita|first=Bhikshu|title=A Survey of Buddhism|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1993|location=Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom|pages=449–60|isbn=0-904766-65-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common prayer is "May the merit of my practice, adorn Buddhas' Pure Lands, requite the fourfold kindness from above, and relieve the suffering of the three life-journeys below. Universally wishing sentient beings, Friends, foes, and karmic creditors, all to activate the bodhi mind, and all to be reborn in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss."

The [[Generation Stage]] (Sanskrit: ''utpatti-krama'') of [[Vajrayana]] involves prayer elements.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''. Great Britain, Oxford: Oxford University Press. P.100. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tibetan Buddhism]] tradition emphasizes an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as [[guru yoga]] which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits the existence of various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or ''[[yidam]]'' are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: ''santana''; refer [[mindstream]]) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage ''yidam'' or [[tutelary deities]] will depend upon the level or more appropriately ''[[yana (Buddhism)|yana]]'' at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is ''[[śūnyatā]]''. The views of the more esoteric ''yana'' are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] emphasizes the recitation by devotees of prayer-like [[mantra]]s, a practice often called ''[[Nembutsu]]''.&lt;ref name=smithnovak03&gt;"The Flowering of Faith: Buddhism's Pure Land Tradition" (pp. 185–98) in {{cite book

According to [[Shinran]], the founder of the [[Pure Land Buddhism]] tradition that is most prevalent in the US,&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Novak (2003) state that "Pure Land Buddhism has entered America almost exclusively from Japan, and the church Shinran founded is the largest Pure Land presence on this continent" (p. 193).&lt;/ref&gt; "for the long haul nothing is as efficacious as the Nembutsu."&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|197}}&lt;ref&gt;This quotation is Smith and Novak's paraphrase of Shinran's teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realization.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

But beyond all these practices the Buddha emphasized the primacy of individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary. Nevertheless, today many lay people in East Asian countries pray to the Buddha in ways that resemble Western prayer—asking for intervention and offering devotion.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Prayer in Hinduism}}
[[File:Bangladesh Prayer.jpg|thumb|[[Shaktism|Shakta]] Hindus in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, pray to the goddess during ''[[Durga Puja]]'', October 2003]]
[[Hinduism]] has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: ''prārthanā''), from fire-based [[yajna|rituals]] to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, ''dhyanam'' involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as ''devtas'', trinity or incarnation of either ''devtas'' or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment, and also for the benefit of others. Ritual [[invocation]] was part and parcel of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the [[Vedas]], are a large collection of [[mantra]]s and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, [[Brahman]], that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the [[Hindu pantheon]]{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}. Hindus in [[India]] have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to its three manifestations, a creator god called [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]], a preserver god called [[Vishnu]] and a destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) [[Shiva]], and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together in ''[[pranam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5732hIV03kC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Stephen Jacobs (2010), ''Hinduism Today : An Introduction'', Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 44]&lt;/ref&gt; The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting ''[[namaste]]''.

===Sikhism===
[[Image:BhaiSahibJiArdas.jpg|thumb|A [[Sikh]] holy man, doing Sikh prayer ([[Ardās]])]]
The ''[[Ardās]]'' (Punjabi: ਅਰਦਾਸ) is a [[Sikh]] prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily ''[[Banis]]'' (prayers); or completion of a service like the ''[[Paath]]'' (scripture reading/recitation), ''[[kirtan]]'' (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.

The ''Ardas'' is usually always done standing up with folded hands. The beginning of the ''Ardas'' is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses words like "[[Waheguru]] please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake" when starting a new task or "[[Akal Purakh]], having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times", etc. The word "Ardās" is derived from Persian word 'Arazdashat', meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.

Ardās is a unique prayer based on the fact that it is one of the few well-known prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The Ardās cannot be found within the pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word Ardās into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all that he has done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.sgpc.net/ardas/index.asp |title= Ardas |work= sgpc.net |publisher= [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060806235347/http://www.sgpc.net/ardas/index.asp |archivedate= 2006-08-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://new.sgpc.net/ardas/# |title= Learn and recite the Holy Ardas |work= sgpc.net |publisher= [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New religious movements==
[[Wicca]]n prayers can include meditation, rituals and incantations. Prayers are seen as a form of communication with the God and Goddess. This may include prayers for ''[[esbat]]'' and ''[[sabbat]]'' celebrations, for dinner, for pre-dawn times or for your own or others safety, for healing or for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;The Wiccan Prayer Book: Daily, Mark Ventimiglia - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Raëlism]] rites and practises vary from initiation ceremonies, to sensual meditation. An initiation ceremony usually involves a Raelian putting water on the forehead of a new member. Such ceremonies are performed on certain special days on the Raelian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Susan J., Aliens Adored. Rutgers University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Sensual meditation techniques include breathing exercises and various forms of erotic meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Raël, Sensual Meditation. Tagman Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eckankar]], one of the basic forms of prayer includes singing the word "HU" which is pronounced as "hue", a holy name of God. This can be done with eyes closed or open, aloud or silently. Practitioners may experience the divine ECK or Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Eckankar: Ancient Wisdom for Today - Page 20, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of [[Theurgy#Esoteric Christianity|Theurgy]] and [[Western esotericism]] may practice a form of ritual which utilizes both pre-sanctioned prayers and names of God, and prayers "from the heart" that, when combined, allows the participant to ascend spiritually, and in some instances, induce a trance in which God or other spiritual beings may be realized. Very similar to [[Hermetic Qabalah]], and orthodox Kabbalah, it is believed that prayer can influence both the physical and non-physical worlds. The use of ritualistic signs and names are believed to be archetypes in which the subconscious may take form as the [[Inner God]], or another spiritual being, and the "prayer from the heart" to be that spiritual force speaking through the participant.

[[Image:Stelae of Ankh-af-na-khonsu (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|Many Thelemites recite "Resh" (Liber Resh vel Helios, or "Liber CC") facing the direction of the ever-present sun as it rises in the East, triumphs in the South, sets in the West, and "hides" in the North. Photo shows a close-up of the [[Stele of Revealing]].]]
In [[Thelema]] (which includes both theist as well as atheist practitioners) adherents share a number of practices that are forms of individual prayer, including basic yoga; (asana and pranayama); various forms of ritual [[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]]; rituals of one's own devising (often based upon a syncretism of religions, or Western Esotericism, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and Star Ruby); and performance of Liber Resh vel Helios (aka Liber 200), which consists of four daily adorations to the sun (often consisting of 4 hand/body positions and recitation of a memorized song, normally spoken, addressing different godforms identified with the sun).&lt;ref&gt;DuQuette, Lon Milo. The Magick of Aleister Crowley: A Handbook of the Rituals of Thelema, p. 12. Weiser, 2003. {{ISBN|1-57863-299-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no dogma within Thelema that expresses the purpose behind any individual aspirant who chooses to perform "Resh", it may be noted that the practice of "Resh" is not a simple petition toward the sun, nor a form of "worshiping" the celestial body that we call the Sun, but instead uses the positioning of that source of light, which enables life on our planet, as well as uses mythological images of that solar force, so that the individual can perform the prayer, possibly furthering a self-identification with the sun, so "that repeated application of the Liber Resh adorations expands the consciousness of the individual by compelling him to take a different perspective, by inducing him to 'look at things from the point of view of the Sun'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erwinhessle.com/writings/pvsun.php|title=The Point of View of the Sun|first=Erwin|last=Hessle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prayer healing==
{{main|Faith healing}}
Prayer is often used as a means of [[faith healing]] in an attempt to use [[religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] means to prevent illness, cure [[disease]], or improve health. 

Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. [[meta-study|Meta-studies]] have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernable effect" while a 2007 systemic review of [[studies on intercessory prayer]] reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref&gt;K.

Some attempt to heal by prayer, mental practices, spiritual insights, or other techniques, claiming they can summon divine or supernatural intervention on behalf of the ill. Others advocate that ill people may achieve healing through prayer performed by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pell-adamant-prayer-cures-cancer-20091221-l8fy.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=Pell adamant prayer cures cancer|date=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the varied beliefs of those who practice it, faith healing may be said to afford gradual relief from pain or sickness or to bring about a sudden "miracle cure", and it may be used in place of, or in tandem with, conventional medical techniques for alleviating or curing diseases. Faith healing has been criticized on the grounds that those who use it may delay seeking potentially curative conventional medical care. This is particularly problematic when parents use faith healing techniques on children.

===Efficacy of prayer healing===
{{main|Efficacy of prayer}}
[[File:Laying on of hands.jpg|thumb|To pray over an individual while [[laying on of hands|laying hands on them]] is a form of faith healing in Christianity.]]
In 1872, [[Francis Galton]] conducted a famous [[statistics|statistical]] experiment to determine whether prayer had a physical effect on the external environment. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference.&lt;ref name="Galton"/&gt; While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of [[Confounding variable|confounders]], it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.

Two studies claimed that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/07/prayer_still_us.html |author= Anonymous |date= July 20, 2005 |title= Skeptico – Prayer still useless |work= skeptico.blogs.com |type= blog |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104203127/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/07/prayer_still_us.html |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such study, with a [[double-blind]] design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population.&lt;ref name="SouthMedJ"/&gt; Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study.&lt;ref name="Infidels"/&gt; Another such study was reported by Harris et al.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began,&lt;ref&gt;Tessman I and Tessman J "Efficacy of Prayer: A Critical Examination of Claims," Skeptical Inquirer, March/April 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).

One of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990–96, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leibovici | first1 = L | year = 2001 | title = Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection: randomized controlled trial | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 323 | issue = 7327| pages = 1450–1 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1450 | pmid = 11751349 | pmc=61047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results.&lt;ref name="O'Laoire"/&gt; A 2001 double-blind study of the [[Mayo Clinic]] found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aviles | first1 = JM | last2 = Whelan | first2 = SE | last3 = Hernke | first3 = DA | last4 = Williams | first4 = BA | last5 = Kenny | first5 = KE | last6 = O'Fallon | first6 = WM | last7 = Kopecky | first7 = SL | year = 2001 | title = Intercessory prayer and cardiovascular disease progression in a coronary care unit population: a randomized controlled trial | url = | journal = Mayo Clin Proc | volume = 76 | issue = 12| pages = 1192–8 | doi = 10.4065/76.12.1192 | pmid = 11761499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krucoff | first1 = MW | last2 = Crater | first2 = SW | last3 = Gallup | first3 = D | last4 = Blankenship | first4 = JC | last5 = Cuffe | first5 = M | last6 = Guarneri | first6 = M | last7 = Krieger | first7 = RA | last8 = Kshettry | first8 = VR | last9 = Morris | first9 = K | last10 = Oz | first10 = M | last11 = Pichard | first11 = A | last12 = Sketch | first12 = MH Jr | last13 = Koenig | first13 = HG | last14 = Mark | first14 = D | last15 = Lee | first15 = KL | year = 2005 | title = Music, imagery, touch, and prayer as adjuncts to interventional cardiac care: the Monitoring and Actualisation of Noetic Trainings (MANTRA) II randomised study | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9481| pages = 211–7 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66910-3 | pmid = 16023511 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another similar study published in the ''[[American Heart Journal]]'' in 2006,&lt;ref name="STEP 2006" /&gt; Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name="Saletan 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="STEP 2006" /&gt; Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of [[cardiac bypass]] patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.&lt;ref name="STEP 2006"/&gt;

Many believe that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See [[Subject-expectancy effect]].) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, "the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=/Atoz/dc/cen/canc/gen/mindspirit.html#7 Mind and Spirit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201075605/http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=%2FAtoz%2Fdc%2Fcen%2Fcanc%2Fgen%2Fmindspirit.html |date=2009-02-01 }}. ''from the Health Library section of'' [http://www.centrastate.com CentraState Healthcare System]. Accessed May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other practices such as [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], and meditation may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.

Others feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The previously mentioned study published in the ''American Heart Journal'' indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them,&lt;ref name="STEP 2006"/&gt; saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: {{quote|Prior to the start of this study, intercessors reported that they usually receive information about the patient’s age, gender and progress reports on their medical condition; converse with family members or the patient (not by fax from a third party); use individualized prayers of their own choosing; and pray for a variable time period based on patient or family request.}}

One scientific movement attempts to track the physical effects of prayer through [[neuroscience]]. Leaders in this movement include [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]], an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  In Newberg's brain scans, monks,  priests, nuns, [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]s and gurus alike have exceptionally focused attention and compassion sites.  This is a result of the frontal lobe of the brain’s engagement (Newberg, 2009). Newburg believes that anybody can connect to the supernatural with practice. Those without religious affiliations benefit from the connection to the metaphysical as well. Newberg also states that further evidence towards humans' need for metaphysical relationships is that as science had increased spirituality has not decreased. Newburg believes that at the end of the 18th century, when the scientific method began to consume{{page needed|date=September 2010}} the human mind, religion could have vanished. However, two hundred years later, the perception of spirituality, in many instances, appears to be gaining in strength (2009). Newberg's research also provides the connection between prayer and meditation and health. By understanding how the brain works during religious experiences and practices Newberg's research shows that the brain changes during these practices allowing an understanding of how religion affects psychological and physical health (2009).  For example, brain activity during meditation indicates that people who frequently practice prayer or meditation experience lower blood-pressure, lower heart rates, decreased anxiety, and decreased depression.&lt;ref&gt;Newberg, Andrew.

===Prevalence of prayer for health===
Some modalities of [[alternative medicine]] employ prayer. A survey released in May 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018194658/http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm |archivedate=2004-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others' health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.

A '''prayer walk''' is an activity that consists in walking and [[Prayer|praying]] at the same time. It's done not for the physical benefit but for the spiritual exercise, either publicly functioning also as a [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]] or rally (to let other people know the group is praying), or quietly in sight of the subject. For instance, a person or group may be praying for a town or city, and walk the streets of the city while praying, either out loud, or in silence.

[[File:Isaiah's Lips Anointed with Fire.jpg|thumb|Prophetic inspiration: ''Isaiah's Lips Anointed with Fire'', by [[Benjamin West]]]]

In [[religion]], a '''prophet''' is an individual regarded as being in contact with a [[divinity|divine being]] and said to speak on that entity's behalf, serving as an intermediary with humanity by delivering messages or teachings from the [[supernatural]] source to other people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prophet prophet – definition of prophet by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mw1.m-w.com/dictionary/prophet prophet – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The message that the prophet conveys is called a [[prophecy]].

Claims of prophethood have existed in many cultures through history, including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], in [[ancient Greek religion]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manichaeism]], and many others.

==Abrahamic religions==

=== Judaism ===
{{See also|Nevi'im|Prophets in Judaism}}

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word נָבִיא (''nāvî''), "spokesperson", traditionally translates as "prophet".&lt;ref&gt;p.1571, Alcalay. An alternative translation of this Hebrew word is derived from an Akkadian word "nabu," meaning to call. The Hebrew "navi" has a passive sense and means "the one who has been called" (see HALOT, p.661).&lt;/ref&gt; The second subdivision of the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Tanakh|TaNaKh]] (for "Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim"), is devoted to the Hebrew prophets. The meaning of ''navi'' is perhaps described in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 18:18,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:18|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[God]] said, "...and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him." Thus, the ''navi'' was thought to be the "mouth" of God. The root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|bet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-bet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself "open". Cf. [[Rashbam]]'s comment to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Duccio di Buoninsegna 066.jpg|thumb|[[Malachi]], one of the last prophets of Israel, painting by Duccio di Buoninsegna, c. 1310 (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, [[Siena Cathedral]]). ''“He &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mashiach]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children to their parents” (Malachi 4:6)''&lt;ref&gt;cf. “If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Christ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; disciple.” ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 14:26)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In addition to writing and speaking messages from God, [[Israelites|Israelite]] or [[Jews|Jewish]] nevi'im ("spokespersons", "prophets") often acted out prophetic parables in their life.&lt;ref&gt;All the Parables of the Bible, Herbert Lockyer, Zondervan, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in order to contrast the people’s disobedience with the obedience of the [[Rechabite]]s, God has [[Jeremiah]] invite the Rechabites to drink wine, in disobedience to their ancestor’s command. The Rechabites refuse, wherefore God commends them.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 35:13–16, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah 35, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Other prophetic parables acted out by Jeremiah include burying a linen belt so that it gets ruined to illustrate how God intends to ruin Judah's pride.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 13, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cj13"&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah 13, Jeremiah, The Anchor Bible, Doubleday, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cj13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah, Lamentations, Tremper Longman, Hendrickson Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Jeremiah buys a clay jar and smashes it in the [[Gehenna|Valley of Ben Hinnom]] in front of elders and priests to illustrate that God will smash the [[Kingdom of Judah|nation of Judah]] and the city of Judah beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 19, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; God instructs Jeremiah to make a yoke from wood and leather straps and to put it on his own neck to demonstrate how God will put the nation under the yoke of [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], king of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 27–28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the prophet [[Isaiah]] had to walk stripped and barefoot for three years to illustrate the coming captivity,&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 20, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and the prophet [[Ezekiel]] had to lie on his side for 390 days and eat measured food to illustrate the coming siege.&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophetic assignment is not always portrayed as positive in the Hebrew Bible,&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Isaiah (Commentary), John Goldingay, Hendrickson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Isaiah 6:8–13, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and prophets were often the target of persecution and opposition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;’’Jeremiah (Prophet)’’, The Anchor Bible Dictionary Volume 3, Doubleday, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; God’s personal prediction for Jeremiah, "Attack you they will, overcome you they can't,"&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 1:19, The Anchor Bible, Doubleday, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; was performed many times in the [[Bible prophecy|biblical narrative]] as Jeremiah warned of destruction of those who continued to refuse repentance and accept more moderate consequences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’’Jeremiah, Lamentations’’, F.B. Huey, Broadman Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In return for his adherence to God’s discipline and speaking God’s words, Jeremiah was attacked by his own brothers,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 12:6, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; beaten and put into the stocks by a priest and [[false prophet]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 20:1–4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The NIV Study Bible, Zondervan, 1995, p. 1501&lt;/ref&gt; imprisoned by the king,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 37:18, Jeremiah 38:28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; threatened with death,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 38:4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; thrown into a cistern by Judah’s officials,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 38:6, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed by a false prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Isaiah was told by his hearers who rejected his message, "Leave the way! Get off the path! Let us hear no more about the [[Book of Isaiah#"Holy One of Israel"|Holy One of Israel]]!"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 30:11, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The life of Moses being threatened by [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]] is another example.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 2, Exodus 10:28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to I [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 9:9,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:9|105}}, Hebrew – English Bible&lt;/ref&gt; the old name for navi is ''ro'eh'', רֹאֶה, which literally means "Seer". That could document an ancient shift, from viewing prophets as seers for hire to viewing them as moral teachers. Allen (1971) comments that in the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] Era, there were essentially seer-priests, who formed a guild, [[divination|divined]], performed rituals and sacrifices, and were scribes, and then there were canonical prophets, who did none of these (and were against divination) and had instead a message to deliver.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The seer-priests were usually attached to a local shrine or temple, such as [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]], and initiated others as priests in that priesthood: it was a mystical craft-guild with apprentices and recruitment. Canonical prophets were not organised this way. The similar term ''ben-navi'' ("son of the prophet") means "member of a seer-priest guild".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some examples of prophets in the Tanakh include [[Abraham]], Moses, [[Miriam]], Isaiah, [[Samuel]], Ezekiel, [[Malachi]], and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]. In Jewish tradition [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] is not counted in the list of prophets.

A Jewish tradition suggests that there were twice as many prophets as the number which left Egypt, which would make 1,200,000 prophets.&lt;ref name="jfaq"/&gt; The [[Talmud]] recognizes the existence of [[Prophets in Judaism#The 48 Prophets|48 male prophets]] who bequeathed permanent messages to mankind.&lt;ref name="jfaq"/&gt; According to the Talmud there were also seven women who are counted as prophetesses whose message bears relevance for all generations: [[Sarah]], [[Miriam]], [[Deborah|Devorah]], [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] (mother of the prophet Samuel), [[Abigail]] (a wife of [[David|King David]]), [[Huldah]] (from the time of Jeremiah), and [[Esther]].&lt;ref name="jfaq"/&gt; The Jewish Rabbi [[Rashi]] points out that [[Rebecca]], [[Rachel]], and [[Leah]] were also prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Rashi on Genesis 29:34.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Isaiah 8#Verse 3|Isaiah 8:3-4]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-Chapter-8_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible: Book of Isaiah, chapter 8, verse 3-4. | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170219105523/https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-Chapter-8_Original-1611-KJV | archive-date = February 19, 2017 | deadurl = no}}: "And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz."&lt;/ref&gt;refers he married "the prophetess", which conceived and gave to him a son, named by God [[Maher-shalal-hash-baz|Mahèr-salàl-cash-baz]]. Her name isn't elsewhere specified.

Prophets in Tanakh are not always Jews.&lt;ref name="jfaq"&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/prophet.htm Prophets and Prophecy]&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Balaam]] in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22 describes a non-Jewish prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|24:1–24:18|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Talmud, [[Obadiah]] is said to have been a convert to Judaism.

The last nevi'im ("spokespersons", "prophets") mentioned in the [[Jewish Bible]] are [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]], all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year Babylonian exile. The [[Talmud]] ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a) states that Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi were the last prophets, and nowadays only the "[[Bath Kol]]" (בת קול, lit. ''daughter of a voice'', "voice of God") exists.

==== Traditional definitions ====
In [[Christianity]] a prophet (or seer)&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:9|9}}, [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; is one inspired by God through the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] to deliver a message for a specific purpose. God's calling of someone as a prophet does not have the purpose of to elevating an individual for their own glory, but for the glory of God and to turn people to him.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Some [[Christian]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] limit a prophet's message to words intended only for the entire church congregation, excluding personal messages not intended for the body of believers; but in the [[Bible]] on a number of occasions prophets were called to deliver personal messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|14:1–7|9}}, {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|3:11|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of a message is termed [[revelation]] and the delivery of the message is termed prophecy.

The term "prophet" applies to those who receive public or private revelation. Public revelation, in Catholicism, is part of the [[Deposit of faith]], the revelation of which was completed by Jesus; whereas Private Revelation does not add to the Deposit. The term "deposit of faith" refers to the entirety of Jesus Christ's revelation, and is passed to successive generations in two different forms, sacred scripture (the Bible) and sacred tradition.

The Bible terms anyone who claims to speak God's words or to teach in his name without being a prophet a [[false prophet]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} One [[Old Testament]] text  in the [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:21–22|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a warning against those who prophesy events which do not come to pass and says they should be put to death. Elsewhere a false prophet may be someone who is purposely trying to deceive, is delusional, under the influence of [[Satan]] or is speaking from his own spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|13:3|9}}, "Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!"&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ongoing prophecy ? ====
[[File:Mattia Preti - San Giovanni Battista Predicazione.jpg|thumb|''St. John the Baptist Preaching'', {{circa|1665}}, by [[Mattia Preti]]]]
Some Christians who believe in [[dispensationalism]] believe prophecy ended (along with the rest of the sign gifts) shortly after the coming of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], who delivered the "[[Biblical law in Christianity |fullness of the law]]". Within this group, many Protestants believe that prophecy ended with the last of the Hebrew prophets of the [[Hebrew Bible]], leaving a gap of about 400 years between then and the life of Jesus. The majority of Christians, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], allow an exception for [[John the Baptist]] as a prophet contemporary with Jesus.

[[New Testament]] passages that explicitly discuss prophets existing after the death and resurrection of [[Christ]] include [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 11:10,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Revelation|11:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 10:40–41 and 23:34,&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of Matthew {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|10:40–41|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|23:34|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel of John|John]] 13:20 and 15:20&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of John {{Bibleverse-nb||John|13:20|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||John|15:20|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 11:25–30, 13:1 and 15:32.&lt;ref&gt;Acts of the Apostles {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|11:25–30|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:1|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:32|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians believe that the Holy Spirit leads people to faith in Jesus and gives them the ability to lead a [[Christian worship |Christian life]] and to give gifts (i.e. abilities) to Christians. These may include the [[charism]]atic gifts such as prophecy, [[Glossolalia|tongues]], [[faith healing| miraculous healing]] ability, and [[clairsentience]]. Christians holding a view known as [[cessationism]] believe that these gifts were given only in New Testament times and that they ceased after the last [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle died]].

The ''[[Didache]]'' gives extensive instruction in how to distinguish between true and false prophets, as well as commands regarding tithes to prophets in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html Early Christian Writings: Didache (Chapters 11–15)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]], wrote of 2nd-century believers with the gift of prophecy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103506.htm ''Against Heresies'', Book V Chapter 6.1]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Justin Martyr]] argued in his ''Dialogue with Trypho'' that prophets were not found among the Jews in his time, but that the church had prophets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html Early Christian Writings: ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (Chapter LXXXII)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'' describes revelation in a vision regarding the proper operation of prophecy in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/shepherd.html Early Christian Writings: Shepherd of Hermas (Eleventh Commandment)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius of Caesarea |Eusebius]] mentions that [[Quadratus of Athens| Quadratus]] and Ammia of [[Alaşehir| Philadelphia]] were both prominent prophets following the age of the Twelve Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book III, Chapter 37.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250105.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book V, Chapter 17.2–4]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]], writing of the church meetings of the [[Montanism|Montanists]] (to whom he belonged), described in detail the practice of prophecy in the 2nd-century church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0310.htm ''A Treatise on the Soul'', Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of later Christian saints were claimed{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} to have powers of prophecy, such as [[Columba of Iona]] (521-597), [[Saint Malachy]] (1094-1148) or [[Padre Pio]] (1887-1968). [[Marian apparition]]s like those at [[Fátima, Portugal | Fatima]] in 1917 or at [[Kibeho]] in Rwanda in the 1980s often included prophetic predictions regarding the future of the world as well as of the local areas they occurred in.&lt;ref&gt;http://marianapparitions.org/marian_apparitions/index.html, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophetic movements in particular can be traced throughout the Christian Church's history, expressing themselves in (for example) [[Montanism]], [[Novatianism]], [[Donatism]], [[Franciscan]]ism, [[Anabaptist|Anabaptism]], [[Camisard]] enthusiasm, [[Puritan]]ism, [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]], [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]], [[Lutheranism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/products/book/lay-prophets-lutheran-europe-c-1550-1700 Jürgen Beyer, ''Lay prophets in Lutheran Europe (c. 1550–1700)'' (Brill's series in church history and religious culture 74), Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pietism]].

Some Christians also believe that the title "prophet" encompasses others than those who receive visions from God. A more modern definition of prophet is someone who spreads God's truths.{{cn|date=September 2018}} These can be revealed in a number of ways, not only visions.

Some Christian sects recognize the existence of a "modern-day" prophet. One such denomination is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which teaches that God still communicates with mankind through prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;
Whether or not the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is considered a Christian denomination is subject to dispute, see [[Mormonism and Christianity]].

=== Islam ===
{{Islamic prophets}}
{{Main article|Prophets and messengers in Islam}}

The [[Quran]] identifies a number of men as "Prophets of Islam" ({{lang-ar|نبي}} ''nabī''; pl. {{lang|ar|أنبياء}} ''anbiyāʾ''). [[Muslim]]s believe such individuals were assigned a special mission by [[God in Islam|God]] to guide humanity. Besides [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], this includes prophets such as [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham (''Ibrāhīm'')]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses (''Mūsā'')]] () and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus (''ʿĪsā'')]].

[[File:Mohammed receiving revelation from the angel Gabriel.jpg|thumb|left|A [[depictions of Muhammad|depiction of Muhammad]] receiving his first revelation from the angel Gabriel. From the manuscript ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], 1307, [[Ilkhanate]] period.]]

Other traditions place the number of prophets at 224,000. Some scholars hold that there are an even greater number in the history of mankind, and only God knows. The Qur'an says that God has sent a prophet to every group of people throughout time, and that Muhammad is the last of the prophets, sent for the whole of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message of all the prophets is believed to be the same. In Islam, all prophetic messengers are prophets (such as [[Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Muhammad]]) though not all prophets are prophetic messengers. The primary distinction is that a prophet is required to demonstrate God's law through his actions, character, and behavior without necessarily calling people to follow him, while a prophetic messenger is required to pronounce God's law (i.e. revelation) and call his people to submit and follow him. Muhammad is distinguished from the rest of the prophetic messengers and prophets in that he was commissioned by God to be the prophetic messenger to all of mankind. Many of these prophets are also found in the texts of Judaism (The Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings) and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;(see [[Biblical narratives and the Qur'an]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims often refer to Muhammad as "the Prophet", in the form of a noun.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary''. p. 1111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion, William A. Graham, William Albert Graham – 1993, p93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The militia – Page 100, James B. Whisker – 1992 "The work of Mohammed (569–632), commonly called the Prophet, the Koran was revealed in a series of visions over a period of many years beginning in 610"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz’ 26 (Part 26): Al-Ahqaf 1 To Az-Zariyat 30, Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman – 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is the result of a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] in Islam as in Christianity, and is regarded as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|45|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, four prophets are believed to have been sent [[Islamic holy books|holy books]]: the [[Torah in Islam|Torah (''Tawrat'')]] to Moses, the [[Zabur|Psalms (''Zābūr'')]] to David, the [[Gospel in Islam|Gospel]] to Jesus, and the Qur'an to Muhammad; those prophets are considered "Messengers" or ''rasūl''. Other main prophets are considered messengers or ''nabī'', even if they didn't receive a Book from God. Examples include the messenger-prophet [[Aaron#Islam|Aaron| (''Hārūn'')]], the messenger-prophet [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael (''Ismāʿīl'')]]) and the messenger-prophet [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph (''Yūsuf'')]].

Although it offers many incidents from the lives of many prophets, the Qur'an focuses with special narrative and rhetorical emphasis on the careers of the first four of these five major prophets. Of all the figures before Muhammad, Moses is referred to most frequently in the Qur'an. As for the fifth, the [[Qur'an]] is frequently addressed directly to Muhammad, and it often discusses situations encountered by him. Direct use of his name in the text, however, is rare. Rarer still is the mention of Muhammad's contemporaries.

=== Bahá'í ===
{{Main article|Manifestation of God}}

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] refers to what are commonly called prophets as "Manifestations of God" who are directly linked with the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]]. Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as "Manifestations of God" or "divine educators".&lt;ref name="eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Bahā'īs | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | isbn = 0-02-865733-0 | pages = 737–740}}&lt;/ref&gt; In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world. Thus they are seen as an intermediary between God and humanity.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifestations of God are not seen as incarnations of God, and are also not seen as ordinary mortals. Instead, the Bahá'í concept of the Manifestation of God emphasizes simultaneously the humanity of that intermediary and the divinity in the way they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; thus they have both human and divine stations.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;

In addition to the Manifestations of God, there are also minor prophets. While the Manifestations of God, or major prophets, are compared to the Sun (which produces its own heat and light), minor prophets are compared to the Moon (which receives its light from the sun). Moses, for example, is taught as having been a Manifestation of God and his brother Aaron a minor prophet. Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 4:14–17).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:14–17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish prophets are considered minor prophets, as they are considered to have come in the shadow of the dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion.

== Prophetic claims in movements deriving from Abrahamic religions ==
In modern times the term "prophet" can be somewhat controversial. Many Christians with [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic beliefs]] believe in the continuation of the gift of prophecy and the continuation of the role of prophet as taught in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ephesians|4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of prophecies can vary widely. Prophecies are often spoken as quotes from God. They may contain quotes from scripture, statements about the past or current situation, or predictions of the future. Prophecies can also 'make manifest the secrets' of the hearts of other people, telling about the details of their lives. Sometimes, more than one person in a congregation will receive the same message in prophecy, with one giving it before another.

Other movements claim to have prophets. In France, Michel Potay says he received a revelation, called ''The Revelation of Arès'', dictated by Jesus in 1974, then by God in 1977. He is considered a prophet by his followers, the [[Pilgrims of Arès]].

===Catholicism ===

A number of modern catholic saints have been claimed to have powers of prophecy, such as [[Padre Pio]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ewtn.com/padrepio/man/biography2.htm, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexandrina Maria da Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ALEXDRIN.HTM, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this many modern [[Marian apparition]]s included prophecies in them about the world and about the local areas. The [[Three Secrets of Fátima|Fátima apparition]] in 1917 included a prophecy given by Mary to three children, that on October 13, 1917 there would be a great miracle for all to see at [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]], Portugal, and on that day tens of thousands of people headed to Fátima to see what would happen including newspaper journalists. Many witnesses, including journalists, claimed to see the sun "dance" in the sky in the afternoon of that day, exactly as the visionaries had predicted several months before.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ewtn.com/fatima/sixth-apparition-of-our-lady.asp, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Our Lady of Kibeho|Kibeho apparition]] in [[Rwanda]] in the 1980s included many prophecies about great violence and destruction that was coming, and the [[Rwandan genocide]] only ten years later was interpreted by the visionaries as the fulfilment of these prophecies &lt;ref&gt;http://www.michaeljournal.org/kibeho.htm, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Several miracles and a vision of the [[Prophecy of the Popes|identity of the last 112 Popes]] were attributed to [[Saint Malachy]], the [[Archbishop of Armagh]] (1095–1148).

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===
{{See also|Watch Tower Society unfulfilled predictions}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not consider any single person in their modern-day organization to be a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibletopics.com/biblestudy/images/88f.gif |title=The Watchtower, Number 7, Vol. XCIII |accessdate=2009-09-12 |date=1972-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their literature has referred to their organization collectively as God's "prophet" on earth; this is understood, however, in the sense of declaring their interpretation of God's judgments from the Bible along with God's guidance of His Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Keep Yourselves in God's Love'', 2008 Watch Tower, page 209, "Today, prophesying would apply to any Bible-based teaching that a Christian minister does."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Would That All Were Prophets!”, ''Awake!'', Watch Tower, June 8, 1986, page 9, "True Christians are prophets in that they teach others God’s Word"&lt;/ref&gt; Their publishing company, [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower]], and official position magazine, ''[[The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower]]'', have asserted: "Ever since ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' began to be published in July 1879 it has looked ahead into the future... No, ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' is no inspired prophet, but it follows and explains a Book of prophecy the predictions in which have proved to be unerring and unfailing till now. ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' is therefore under safe guidance. It may be read with confidence, for its statements may be checked against that prophetic Book."&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower 1 January 1969''&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that they are God's one and only true channel to mankind on earth, and used by God for this purpose.

They have made many [[Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses|eschatological forecasts]], some of which have led people (including followers) to incorrect assumptions. One example is ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower's'' assertions that the end of the "[[Gentile#LDS Church usage|Gentile]] times" or "times of the nations" would occur in 1914; even prominent Watch Tower representatives such as [[Alexander Hugh Macmillan#Macmillan's proclamation of 1914|A. H. Macmillan]] incorrectly concluded and overstated their expectations. As a result, ''The Watchtower'' has acknowledged that Jehovah's Witnesses "have made mistakes in their understanding of what would occur at the end of certain time periods."&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'' p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently with these exceptions, Jehovah's Witnesses in their literature and assemblies have taught their leadership was personally chosen by Jesus Christ in 1919 (a prophetic year in Jehovah's Witnesses eschatology) and that they are "God's sole channel on earth," and "Jehovah's spirit directed organization".

=== Founders of Christian sects or movements ===

==== Latter Day Saint ====
[[File:Joseph Smith, Jr. portrait owned by Joseph Smith III.jpg|thumb|A portrait of [[Joseph Smith]]]]

{{Main article|Prophet, seer, and revelator|President of the Church|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}

[[Joseph Smith]], who established the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] in 1830, is considered a prophet by members of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], of which [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is the largest denomination. Additionally, many churches within the movement believe in a succession of modern prophets (accepted by Latter Day Saints as "[[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]]") since the time of Joseph Smith. [[Russell M. Nelson]] is the current president and prophet of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

=== Judaic messianism ===
[[Nathan of Gaza]] was a theologian and author who became famous as a prophet for the alleged messiah, [[Sabbatai Zevi]].

== Other religions ==

=== Hinduism ===
The [[Hinduism|Hindu]] concept of [[rishis]] is similar to the concept of prophets. The Sanskrit word ''rishi'' is loosely translated into English as "seer" (a prophet, a man who can foresee the future). Hinduism recognizes and reveres thousands of rishis, who can be thought of as the collective founders of the Hindu religion over many millennia. Of these, special importance is given to the [[Saptarshi]] (the Seven Sages), widely regarded as patriarchs of the Hindu religion, whose listing is different according to different texts. The Saptarshi and their clans are believed to have composed the hymns of the four [[Vedas]] by entering into communion with the Supreme Cosmic Spirit through meditation. For instance, [[Rigveda]] 1.1 is attributed to Rishi Madhucchandā Vaishwāmitra (i.e. Madhucchandā of the clan of [[Vishwamitra]]). Most rishikās were male, but some were female too. [[Lopamudra]] is the author of one hymn in the Rigveda, and [[Gargi Vachaknavi]] is described in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] as a highly respected woman in the field of Brahmajñāna. Apart from the Vedas, various rishis are also credited with composing the several [[Smriti]] texts, like [[Veda Vyasa]] who composed the ''[[Mahābhārata]]''.

=== Ifa and other African traditional religions ===
{{main|Traditional African religion|Ifá|Religion in Africa}}

[[Divination]] remains an important aspect of the lives of the people of contemporary [[Africa]], especially amongst the usually rural, socially traditionalistic segments of its population. In arguably its most influential manifestation, the system of prophecy practiced by the [[Babalawo]]s and [[Iyanifa]]s of the historically [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] regions of [[West Africa]] have bequeathed to the world a corpus of [[fortune-telling]] poetic methodologies so intricate that they have been added by [[UNESCO]] to its official ''[[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage of the World list]]''.

=== Tenrikyo ===
[[Tenrikyo]]'s prophet, [[Nakayama Miki]], is believed by Tenrikyoans to have been a messenger of God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130502133710/http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/eng/?page_id=104 oyasama]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], Swedish scientist, philosopher, theologian, revelator, and mystic.

== Native Americans ==
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Great Peacemaker]] (Deganawidah) co-founded the [[Iroquois#Iroquois Confederacy|Haudenosaunee league]] in [[pre-Columbian]] times. In retrospect, his [[Great Peacemaker#Prophecy of the boy seer|prophecy of the boy seer]] could appear to refer to the conflict between natives and Europeans (white serpent).

From 1805 until the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] that falsified his predictions in 1811, the "[[Shawnee]] prophet" [[Tenskwatawa]] lead an Indian alliance to stop Europeans to take more and more land going west. He reported [[vision (spirituality)|vision]]s he had. He is said to have accurately predicted a [[solar eclipse]]. His brother [[Tecumseh]] re-established the alliance for [[Tecumseh's War]], that ended with the latter's death in 1813. Tecumseh fought together with British forces that, in the area of the [[Great Lakes]], occupied essentially today's territory of [[Canada]].

[[Francis the Prophet]], influenced by Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, was a leader of the [[Red Stick]] faction of the [[Muscogee|Creek]] Indians. He traveled to England in 1815 as a representative of the "four Indian nations" in an unsuccessful attempt to get Great Britain to help them resist the expansionism of the white settlers.

20 years later (1832), [[Wabokieshiek]], the "[[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] Prophet", after whom [[Prophetstown, Illinois|Prophetstown]] has been named, (also called "White Cloud") claimed that British forces would support the Indians in the [[Black Hawk War]] against the United States as 20 years earlier (based on "visions"). They did not, and no longer he was considered a "prophet".

In 1869, the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] [[Wodziwob]] founded the [[Ghost Dance]] movement. The dance rituals were an occasion to announce his visions of an earthquake that would swallow the whites. He seems to have died in 1872.

The [[Northern Paiute]] [[Wovoka]] claimed he had a vision during the [[solar eclipse]] of January 1, 1889, that the Paiute dead would come back and the whites would vanish from America, provided the natives performed [[Ghost Dance]]s. This idea spread among other Native American peoples. The government were worried about a rebellion and sent troops, which lead to the death of [[Sitting Bull]] and to the [[Wounded Knee massacre]] in 1890.

== Secular usage ==
In the late 20th century the appellation of ''prophet'' has been used to refer to individuals particularly successful at analysis in the field of economics, such as in the derogatory ''prophet of greed''. Alternatively, social commentators who suggest escalating crisis are often called ''prophets of doom.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ruff sees more rough times ahead – MarketWatch | accessdate = 2009-04-09 | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/ruff-sees-more-rough-times/story.aspx?guid=%7B0354D5FB%2D2AE2%2D48CB%2DA7F0%2D4B06FBE5EE61%7D&amp;dist=TNMostRead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nouriel Roubini: I fear the worst is yet to come – Times Online | accessdate = 2009-04-09 | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5014463.ece | quote = ...after making a series of uncannily accurate predictions about the global meltdown, Roubini has become the prophet of his age... | work=The Times | location=London | first=Dominic | last=Rushe | date=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''religious name''' is a type of [[given name]] bestowed for a religious purpose, and which is generally used in religious contexts.  Different types of religious names may be in use among  [[clergy]] of a religion, as well in some cases among the [[laity]].

==Christianity==

===Catholic Church===

====Baptism name====
In [[baptism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] are given a [[Christian name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |title=Christian Names |year=1911 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |publication-place=[[New York City|New York]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be "foreign to Christian sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7K.HTM#$295 Code of Canon Law, canon 2156]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often the name of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=207 Catholic Activity: Baptismal Names]&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.

====Confirmation name====
In some countries, it is common to adopt a [[Confirmation#Confirmation name|confirmation name]], in addition to the baptismal name.

====Monastic and papal name====
In some [[religious institute]]s, a new member takes a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their ''[[:it:al secolo]]'' name. A [[Papal election|newly elected]] [[Pope]] also takes on a new name, called his [[regnal name]] or [[papal name]].

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Baptism name====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by [[baptism]] or [[chrismation]]. A person's religious name is always the name of a [[saint]], who then becomes that person's [[patron saint]]. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their "[[name day]]" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.

====Monastic name====
Orthodox [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s are often given a new monastic name at the time of their [[tonsure]] (i.e., when they take their [[monastic vows]]). A monastic name is usually the name of a [[prophet]] or a [[monastic]] saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.

==Judaism==
[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] take a [[Hebrew name]] upon conversion.  Born Jews generally have a [[patronymic]] Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their [[legal name]], especially when the latter is of [[gentile]] or non-Hebrew origin.

==Buddhism==
Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects also practice this, with newly ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given [[Dharma name]]s during their [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge ceremony]].

==Others==

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
Members of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] and some other [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organisations are given a "spiritual name" by their [[guru]] upon initiation. This name ends in "Das" or "Dasa" for men and "Dasi" for women (meaning "servant"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], a [[craft name]] is often used.

===Parody religions===
It is usual for a [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Discordian Episkopos]] to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related [[Church of the SubGenius]].

'''Sacred architecture''' (also known as '''religious architecture''') is a [[religion|religious]] [[architecture|architectural]] practice concerned with the design and construction of [[place of worship|places of worship]] or sacred or intentional space, such as [[Church architecture|churches]], [[Mosque#Architecture|mosques]], [[stupa]]s, [[synagogue architecture|synagogues]], and [[temple]]s. Many cultures devoted considerable resources to their sacred architecture and places of worship. Religious and sacred spaces are amongst the most impressive and permanent [[monolithic architecture|monolithic]] [[building]]s created by humanity. Conversely, sacred architecture as a locale for meta-intimacy may also be non-monolithic, ephemeral and intensely private, personal and non-public.

Sacred, religious and holy structures often evolved over centuries and were the largest buildings in the world, prior to the modern skyscraper. While the various styles employed in sacred architecture sometimes reflected trends in other structures, these styles also remained unique from the contemporary architecture used in other structures. With the rise of [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] [[monotheism]]s (particularly [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]), religious buildings increasingly became centres of [[worship]], [[prayer]] and [[meditation]].

The Western scholarly discipline of the [[history of architecture]] itself closely follows the history of religious architecture from ancient times until the [[Baroque period]], at least. [[Sacred geometry]], [[iconography]], and the use of sophisticated [[semiotics]] such as signs, symbols and religious motifs are endemic to sacred architecture.

== Spiritual aspects of religious architecture ==

[[File:Orthodox-Church-interior.jpg|left|thumb|An illustrated layout of the traditional interior of a [[Christian]] [[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|Orthodox church]].]]

Sacred or religious architecture is sometimes called sacred space.

Architect Norman L. Koonce has suggested that the goal of sacred architecture is to make "transparent the boundary between matter and mind, flesh and the spirit." In discussing sacred architecture, Protestant minister [[Robert Schuller]] suggested that "to be psychologically healthy, human beings need to experience their natural setting—the setting we were designed for, which is the garden." Meanwhile, [[Richard Kieckhefer]] suggests that entering into a religious building is a metaphor for entering into spiritual relationship. Kieckhefer suggests that sacred space can be analyzed by three factors affecting spiritual process: longitudinal space emphasizes the procession and return of sacramental acts, auditorium space is suggestive of proclamation and response, and new forms of communal space designed for gathering and return depend to a great degree on minimized scale to enhance intimacy and participation in worship.

== Ancient architecture ==

[[File:Karnak Temple Interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the ancient Egyptian [[Karnak|Karnak Temple]].]]

Sacred architecture spans a number of ancient architectural styles including [[Neolithic architecture]], [[ancient Egyptian architecture]] and [[Sumerian architecture]]. Ancient religious buildings, particularly temples, were often viewed as the dwelling place, the ''[[temenos]]'',  of the gods and were used as the site of various kinds of sacrifice. Ancient tombs and burial structures are also examples of architectural structures reflecting religious beliefs of their various societies. The [[Temple of Karnak]] at Thebes, Egypt was constructed across a period of 1300 years and its numerous temples comprise what may be the largest religious structure ever built. Ancient Egyptian religious architecture has fascinated archaeologists and captured the public imagination for millennia.

== Classical architecture ==

{{see also|Classical architecture|Architecture of Ancient Greece|Roman architecture}}

[[File:ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].]]

Around 600 BCE the wooden columns of the Temple of Hera at Olympia were replaced by stone columns. With the spread of this process to other sanctuary structures a few stone buildings have survived through the ages. Greek architecture preceded Hellenistic and Roman periods (Roman architecture heavily copied Greek). Since temples are the only buildings which survive in numbers, most of our concept of classical architecture is based on religious structures. The [[Parthenon]] which served as a treasury building as well as a place for veneration of deity, is widely regarded as the greatest example of classical architecture.

== Indian architecture ==

{{see also|Indian rock-cut architecture|Hoysala architecture|Hindu temple architecture}}
[[Indian architecture]] is related to the history and religions of the time periods as well as to the geography and geology of the Indian subcontinent. India was crisscrossed by trading routes of merchants from as far away as [[Siraf]] and [[China]] as well as weathering invasions by foreigners, resulting in multiple influences of foreign elements on native styles.  The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. Indian architecture comprises a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from [[West Asia|West]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe]].

=== Buddhism ===

{{see also|Buddhist architecture|stupa}}

[[Buddhist architecture]] developed in [[South Asia]] beginning in the third century BCE. Two types of structures are associated with early [[Buddhism]]: [[viharas]] and [[stupas]].
Originally, Viharas were temporary shelters used by wandering monks during the rainy season, but these structures later developed to accommodate the growing and increasingly formalized Buddhist [[monasticism]]. An existing example is at [[Nalanda]] ([[Bihar]]).

The initial function of the stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The earliest existing example of a stupa is in [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into [[chaitya]]-grihas (stupa halls). These reached their highpoint in the first century BCE, exemplified by the cave complexes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora]] ([[Maharashtra]]).

The [[pagoda]] is an evolution of the Indian stupa that is marked by a tiered [[tower]] with multiple [[eaves]] common in China, Japan, Korea, Nepal and other parts of Asia.
[[Buddhist temple]]s were developed rather later and outside South Asia, where Buddhism gradually declined from the early centuries CE onwards, though an early example is that of the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] in [[Bihar]]. The architectural structure of the stupa spread across Asia, taking on many diverse forms as details specific to different regions were incorporated into the overall design. It was spread to China and the Asian region by [[Araniko]], a [[Nepal]]i architect in the early 13th century for [[Kublai Khan]].

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu temple architecture}}
[[File:Raghunath Temple Jammu.JPG|left|upright|thumb|The [[Shikhara]] of the [[Raghunath Temple]] at [[Jammu]], [[India]] is built in the Nagara style of temple architecture.]]
[[File:Brihadeshwara front right.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]], Tanjavur, built in the Dravida style]] 
[[Hindu temple architecture]] is based on ''[[Sthapatya Veda]]'' and many other ancient religious texts like the ''[[Brihat Samhita]]'', ''[[Vastu Shastra]]'' and ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]'' in accordance to the design principles and guidelines believed to have been laid by the divine architect [[Vishvakarma]]. It evolved over a period of more than 2000 years. The Hindu architecture conforms to strict religious models that incorporate elements of [[astronomy]] and [[sacred geometry]]. In Hindu belief, the [[temple]] represents the [[macrocosm]] of the universe as well as the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of inner space. While the underlying form of Hindu temple architecture follows strict traditions, considerable variation occurs with the often intense decorative embellishments and ornamentation.

A basic [[Hindu]] [[temple]] consists of an inner sanctum, the ''[[garbhagriha]]'' or womb-chamber, a congregation hall, and possibly an antechamber and porch. The sanctum is crowned by a tower-like ''[[shikhara]]''. The [[Hindu temple]] represents Mount Meru, the axis  of the universe. There are strict rules which describe the themes and sculptures on the outer walls of the temple buildings.

The two primary styles that have developed are the [[Nagara]] style of Northern India and the [[Dravidian architecture|Dravida]] style of Southern India. A prominent difference between the two styles are the elaborate gateways employed in the South. They are also easily distinguishable by the shape and decoration of their shikharas. The Nagara style is beehive-shaped while the Dravida style is pyramid-shaped.

==Byzantine architecture==
{{see also|Byzantine architecture}}
[[File:Aya sofya.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hagia Sophia]], the Church of [[Holy Wisdom]]]] 
[[File:KariyeCamii-Aussenansicht.jpg|thumb|upright|The 6th-century Kariye Camii, Istanbul, is now a museum.]]
[[File:Ani.mosque.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ruins of Menüçehr Camii near Kars, Turkey, believed to be the oldest [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] mosque in [[Anatolia]]]]
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] architecture evolved from Roman architecture. Eventually, a style emerged incorporating Near East influences and the Greek cross plan for church design. In addition, brick replaced stone, classical order was less strictly observed, mosaics replaced carved decoration, and complex domes were erected. One of the great breakthroughs in the history of Western architecture occurred when Justinian's architects invented a complex system providing for a smooth transition from a square plan of the church to a circular dome (or domes) by means of squinches or pendentives. The prime example of early Byzantine religious architecture is the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Istanbul.

==Islam==
{{see also|Islamic architecture}}
Byzantine architecture had a great influence on early Islamic architecture with its characteristic round arches, vaults and domes. Many forms of mosques have evolved in different regions of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. Notable mosque types include the early [[Abbasid]] mosques, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of [[Anatolia]].

[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[Mezquita]], a hypostyle mosque with columns arranged in grid pattern, in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]]]]
The earliest styles in Islamic architecture produced ''Arab-plan'' or ''hypostyle'' mosques during the [[Umayyad Dynasty]]. These mosques follow a square or rectangular plan with enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat prayer hall roofs, which required numerous [[column]]s and [[support (structure)|support]]s.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Masdjid. I. In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers |issn=1573-3912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]] was constructed as a hypostyle mosque supported by over 850 columns.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab-plan mosques continued under the [[Abbasid]] dynasty.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] introduced ''central dome mosques'' in the 15th century that have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having one large dome at the center, there are often smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, in areas where prayer is not performed.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051124083425/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dome of the Rock]] mosque in Jerusalem is perhaps the best known example of a central dome mosque.

''Iwan mosques'' are most notable for their domed chambers and ''[[iwan]]s'', which are vaulted spaces open out on one end. In ''iwan'' mosques, one or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall. The style represents a borrowing from pre-Islamic Iranian architecture and has been used almost exclusively for mosques in [[Iran]]. Many ''iwan'' mosques are converted [[Zoroastrism|Zoroastrian]] fire temples where the courtyard was used to house the sacred fire.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"/&gt; Today, iwan mosques are no longer built.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"/&gt; The [[Shah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran]] is a classic example of an ''iwan'' mosque.
[[File:Mosque of Uqba minaret.jpg|right|thumb|View of the square three-tiered minaret of the [[Mosque of Uqba]] (Great Mosque of Kairouan); this mosque, founded in 670, is one of the most impressive mosques in North Africa, situated in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]]]]

A common feature in mosques is the [[minaret]], the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The first mosques had no minarets, and even nowadays the most conservative Islamic movements, like [[Wahhabism|Wahhabis]], avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and unnecessary. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in [[Basra]] during the reign of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]]. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church (building)|churches]] with their [[bell tower]]s. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose &amp;mdash; calling the faithful to prayer.&lt;ref name="Manara"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Manara, Manar | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domes have been a hallmark of [[Islamic architecture]] since the 7th century. As time progressed, the sizes of mosque domes grew, from occupying only a small part of the roof near the [[mihrab]] to encompassing all of the roof above the prayer hall. Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in India popularized onion-shaped domes in [[South Asia]] and [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architecture of Mughal India |last=Asher |first=Catherine B. |date=1992-09-24 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ISBN=|chapter=Aurangzeb and the Islamization of the Mughal style |page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ablution area inside Eastern wall of Badshahi mosque.JPG|right|thumb|People washing before prayer at the [[Badshahi Masjid|Badshahi mosque]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]]]

The prayer hall, also known as the musalla, has no furniture; chairs and pews are absent from the prayer hall.&lt;ref name="unitulsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/Mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=The University of Tulsa |title=Mosque FAQ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230180348/http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |archivedate=December 30, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer halls contain no images of people, animals, and spiritual figures although they may be decorated with [[Arabic calligraphy]] and verses from the [[Qur'an]] on the walls.

Usually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the ''[[qibla]] wall'', which is the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The ''qibla'' wall is normally set perpendicular to a line leading to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing Signs: Fatimid Public Text |date=1998-12-16 |last=Bierman |first=Irene A. |publisher=University of California Press |ISBN=|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregants pray in rows parallel to the ''qibla'' wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the ''qibla'' wall, usually at its center, is the [[mihrab]], a niche or depression indicating the ''qibla'' wall. Usually the ''mihrab'' is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during [[Friday prayer]]s, a raised [[minbar]] or pulpit is located to the side of the ''mihrab'' for a [[khatib]] or some other speaker to offer a sermon ([[khutbah]]). The mihrab serves as the location where the [[imam]] leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~islamarc/WebPage1/htm_eng/index/keyword1_e.htm |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Terms 1: Mosque |publisher=University of Tokyo Institute of Oriental Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosques often have [[wudu|ablution]] fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. However, worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"/&gt; Modern mosques may have a variety of amenities available to their congregants and the community, such as  [[clinic|health clinics]], [[library|libraries]] and [[gym]]nasiums.

==Medieval architecture==
[[File:Urnesstavkirke.jpg|left|thumb|Norwegian stave church]]
{{see also|medieval architecture}}
{{see also|Church architecture}}
{{see also|Cathedral architecture}}
The religious architecture of Christian churches in the Middle Ages featured the [[Latin cross]] plan, which takes the Roman [[Basilica]] as its primary model with subsequent developments. It consists of a [[nave]], [[transept]]s, and the [[altar]] stands at the east end (see ''[[Cathedral diagram]]''). Also, [[cathedral]]s influenced or commissioned by [[Justinian I|Justinian]] employed the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]] of domes and a [[Greek cross]] (resembling a plus sign), centering attention on the altar at the ''center'' of the church. The [[Church of the Intercession on the Nerl]] is an excellent example of Russian orthodox architecture in the Middle Ages. The [[Urnes stave church]] (Urnes stavkyrkje) in [[Norway]] is a superb example of a medieval stave church.

[[Gothic architecture]] was particularly associated with cathedrals and other churches, which flourished in Europe during the high and late medieval period. Beginning in 12th century France, it was known as "the French Style" during the period. The style originated at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|abbey church of Saint-Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sHrUQclzjlIC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=gothic+originated+saint+denis&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=dD7aTqOVBs2ZhQedteHPDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=gothic%20originated%20saint%20denis&amp;f=false Andrzej Piotrowski (2011), ''Architecture of Thought'', U of Minnesota Press, p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable gothic religious structures include [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], and the [[Chartres Cathedral]].

The Renaissance brought a return of classical influence and a new emphasis on rational clarity. Renaissance architecture represents a conscious revival of Roman Architecture with its symmetry, mathematical proportions, and geometric order. [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s plan for the [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] as the dome of the Florence Cathedral in 1418 was one of the first important religious architectural designs of the Italian renaissance.

==Baroque architecture==

{{see also|baroque architecture}}
Evolving from the renaissance style, the [[baroque]] style was most notably experienced in religious art and architecture. Most architectural historians regard [[Michelangelo]]'s design of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]] as a precursor to the Baroque style. Baroque style can be recognized by broader interior spaces (replacing long narrow naves), more playful attention to light and shadow, extensive ornamentation, large frescoes, focus on interior art, and frequently, a dramatic central exterior projection. The most important early example of the baroque period was the [[Santa Susanna]] by [[Carlo Maderno]]. [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] by [[Christopher Wren]] is regarded as the prime example of the rather late influence of the Baroque style in England.

{{main|Temple architecture (Latter-day Saints)}}
[[Temple (LDS Church)|Temples]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] offer a unique look at design as it has changed from the simple church like structure of the [[Kirtland Temple]] built in the 1830s, to the [[castellated]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] styles of the early [[Utah]] temples, to the dozens of modern temples built today.  
Early temples, and some modern temples, have a priesthood assembly room with two sets of pulpits at each end of the room, with chairs or benches that can be altered to face either way.  Most, but not all temples have the recognizable statue of the [[Angel Moroni]] atop a spire.  The [[Nauvoo Temple]] and the [[Salt Lake Temple]] are adorned with symbolic stonework, representing various aspects of the faith.

==Modern and post-modern architectures==
[[File:IndependenceTemple2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Community of Christ Temple in Independence, Missouri, USA is postmodern in design.]] 
{{see also|Modern architecture|Postmodern architecture}}
[[Modern architecture]] spans several styles with similar characteristics resulting in simplification of form and the elimination of ornament. The most influential modernist architects in the early to mid 20th century include [[Dominikus Böhm]], [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]], and [[Auguste Perret]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven J. Schloeder]], ''Architecture in Communion: Implementing the Second Vatican Council through Liturgy and Architecture.'' (Ignatius Press: 1998): 23-24 and 234-38. {{ISBN|0-89870-631-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While secular structures clearly had the greater influence on the development of modern architecture, several excellent examples of modern architecture can be found in religious buildings of the 20th century. For example, [[Unity Temple]] in Chicago is a [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. The [[United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel]], started in 1954 and completed in 1962, was designed by [[Walter Netsch]] and is an excellent example of modern religious architecture. It has been described as a "phalanx of fighters" turned on their tails and pointing heavenward. In 1967, Architect [[Pietro Belluschi]] designed the strikingly modern [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption]] (San Francisco), the first Catholic cathedral in the United States intended to conform to [[Vatican II]].

Post-modern architecture may be described by unapologetically diverse aesthetics where styles collide, form exists for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. [[Independence Temple|The Temple]] at Independence, Missouri was conceived by Japanese architect [[Gyo Obata]] after the concept of the chambered nautilus. The Catholic [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] (Los Angeles) was designed in 1998 by [[Jose Rafael Moneo]] in a post-modern style. The structure evokes the area's Hispanic heritage through the use of adobe coloring while combining stark modern form with some traditional elements. The [[Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń]] on the other hand is a much more traditional edifice. Designed by [[Barbara Bielecka]] and built between 1994 and 2004, its form includes references to a number of Polish structures. The columns possess a slenderness and delicacy inspired by those of the Renaissance court of [[Wawel Castle]] in [[Kraków]], while the huge 420-foot spire that will be erected next to the basilica bears more than an accidental resemblance to the Baroque spire that adorns the [[Jasna Gora]] monastery of [[Czestochowa]], home of the [[Black Madonna]].

The '''''shi''''' ({{zh|c=尸|p=''shī''|w=''sh'ih''|l=corpse}}) was a ceremonial "personator" who represented a dead relative during ancient [[Ancestor Veneration in China|Chinese ancestral sacrifices]]. In a ''shi'' ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the descendant "corpse" personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey messages from the spirit. [[James Legge]] (1895 IV:135), an early translator of the Chinese classics, described ''shi'' personation ceremonies as "grand family reunions where the dead and the living met, eating and drinking together, where the living worshipped the dead, and the dead blessed the living." In modern terms, this ancient Chinese ''shi'' practice would be described as [[necromancy]], [[mediumship]], or [[spirit possession]].

==Word==
[[File:尸-oracle.svg|thumb|150px|[[Oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-bronze.svg|thumb|150px|[[Bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-seal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Seal script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]

The word ''shi'' 尸 "corpse; personator; inactive; lay out; manage; spirit tablet" can be discussed in terms of [[Chinese character]] evolution, [[Historical Chinese phonology|historical phonology]], [[semantics]], and English translations.

===Characters===
The modern character [[Wikt:尸|尸]] for ''shi'' "corpse; personator" is a graphic simplification of ancient [[pictograph]]s showing a person with a bent back and dangling legs. The first records of ''shi'' are on [[oracle bones]] dating from the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–ca. 1046 BCE). The [[oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" was used interchangeably for ''yi'' [[Wikt:夷|夷]] "barbarian; non-Chinese people (esp. eastern, see ''[[Dongyi]]''); at ease; level". The [[bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸, found in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] dating from the Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty]] (ca. 1045 BCE-ca. 256 BCE), had a more curved back and legs. The graphically reduced [[seal script]] for ''shi'', standardized during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-207 BCE), resembles the [[regular script]] 尸.

Today, ''shi'' 尸 is more commonly used as the [[Radical 44|"corpse/body radical"]] in [[Chinese characters]] (number 44 in the [[List of Kangxi radicals]]) than to write the original word "corpse". Many characters written with this radical involve the body (e.g., ''niao'' [[Wikt:尿|尿]] "urine" with 水 "water"), but not all (e.g., ''wu'' [[Wikt:屋|屋]] "house; room" with 至 "go to"). 

''Shi'' 尸 "corpse; cadaver" has a [[variant Chinese character]] [[Wikt:屍|屍]] that combines the "corpse radical" 尸 with ''si'' [[Wikt:死|死]] "dead" (e.g., ''[[jiang shi]]'' 僵屍 "stiff corpse") Michael Carr (2007:358) explains, "This semantically redundant ''shi'' 屍 'dead-corpse' graphically distinguishes the original 'corpse' meaning of ''shi'' 尸from its various other meanings such as 'personator'."

===Meanings===
[[Chinese classics]] used the word ''shi'' 尸 in six meanings: 
*(1) "corpse; body of a dead person"
*(2) "personator of a dead ancestor"
*(3) "motionless; inactive"
*(4) "lay out; arrange; expose"
*(5) "manage; direct; spirit tablet"
*(6) "proper names (of a place, family, and bird)"
Carr (2007:362) outlines the semantic connections among these ''shi'' meanings. The basic meaning (1) "corpse" was semantically extended into both (2) "act on behalf of a corpse" or "personator of a dead ancestor" and (3) "act like a corpse" or "motionless; inactive; doing nothing". Meaning (4) "lay out, arrange; display" generalizes "lay out a corpse." Meaning (5) "manage; direct; ancestral tablet" links the representative ''shi'' (2) "personator" with the metaphorical replacement "ancestral tablet". Meaning (6) uses ''shi'' to transcribe proper names.

Meaning (1) is the core sense of "corpse; dead body; cadaver; carcass". Early ritual texts, notably the ''[[Liji]]'' "Classic of Rites", ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Rites of Zhou", and ''[[Etiquette and Rites|Yili]]'' "Etiquette and Rites", frequently use ''shi'' "corpse" in [[mortuary]] and [[funeral]] contexts. Here is an example ''Liji'' passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as death took place, the corpse was transferred to the couch, and covered with a large sheet. The clothes in which the deceased had died were removed. A servant plugged the mouth open with the spoon of horn; and to keep the feet from contracting, an easy stool was employed. These observances were the same for a ruler, a great officer, and an ordinary officer. (22, tr. Legge 1885 28:181)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' meaning (2) "personator; sacrificial representative of a dead person's spirit" is discussed below.

Meaning (3) figuratively expands ''shi'' to "corpse-like", which can contextually mean either "motionless; calm; quiescent" or "inactive; negligent; remiss". A ''Shijing'' ode (245, tr. Karlgren 1950:214) laments that, "the good men sit motionless and silent". Karlgren explains, "'The good men act the corpse,' play the part of a representative of the dead at a sacrifice, who sits still and silent during the whole ceremony; here then, remain inactive, do nothing to help." The ''[[Lunyu]]'' ("Confucian Analects") uses ''shi'' to praise [[Confucius]] (tr. Legge 1895 I:235), "In bed, he did not lie like a corpse." Commentators disagree whether this means "sleep with the arms and legs sprawled out" or "sleep facing the north (the land of the dead)".

Meaning (4) is defined as Chinese ''chen'' [[Wikt:陳|陳]] "lay out; set forth, array; arrange; display". Examples in classic texts range from specifically "lay out (a corpse)" to generally "lay out; set out; arrange". The ''Liji'' distinguishes between ''shi'' 尸 "uncoffined corpse" and ''jiu'' [[Wikt:柩|柩]] (with the "wood radical" and a ''jiu'' 匛 "long; enduring" phonetic) "coffined corpse" (tr. Legge 1885 27:117): "(The corpse) on the couch is called [''shi''] (the laid out); when it is put into the coffin, that is called [''jiu''] (being in the long home)." A ''[[Shijing]]'' poem (185, tr. Karlgren 1950) refers to men called off to war, "There are mothers who set forth the (sacrificial) dishes."

Meaning (5) of ''shi'' is defined as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:主|主]] "master; manage, preside; spirit tablet, ancestral tablet". The ''[[Chuci]]'' (tr. Hawkes 1959:55) uses ''shi'' asking about [[King Wu of Zhou]], whose father [[King Wen of Zhou]] did not live to see the conquering of the previous dynasty, Shang-Yin: "When Wu set out to kill Yin, why was he so grieved? He went into the battle carrying the 'corpse.' Why was he in such haste?" Commentators disagree whether this ''shi'' means ''zhu'', specifically ''muzhu'' 木主 "wooden spirit/ancestral tablet" or ''jiu'' "corpse in a coffin". Hawkes justifies translating "corpse": "According to some accounts it was the 'spirit tablet' of his dead father [King Wen] which King Wu carried in his chariot to battle. But I think the poet understood him to have taken the actual corpse, and was surprised that he had not waited to bury it."

The sinologists Eduard Erkes and Bernhard Karlgren debated this ''Chuci'' usage of ''shi'' "corpse; spirit tablet". Erkes (1928) proposed that the ''zhu'' was a wooden ancestral tablet shaped in the image of the deceased. Karlgren (1930) disagreed and argued that the ''zhu'' was phallic shaped:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to think that the substitution of [muzhu] 'wooden tablet' for the corpse (if really a corpse is intended; the word shi is ambiguous) proves the [muzhu] to have been an image of the corpse, and therefore he translates [muzhu] by 'wooden statue.' Nothing could be more arbitrary. The [muzhu], wooden ancestral tablet, was the resting place of the ancestor's spirit, once his body was dead and decomposed. In this sense it was a substitute for his body, his spiritual force had entered it, and therefore it was carried into battle, bringing this mental force of his into play on the side of his descendant. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erkes (1931) countered Karlgren by citing other texts describing a human-shaped ''muzhu'' "wooden lord". For instance, the ''[[Shiji]]'' ("Record of History", tr. Erkes) records this King Wu story with ''muzhu'' instead of ''shi'': "He (viz. Wu-Wang) made a wooden image of Wen-Wang and took it with [him] on his carriage into the battle." Erkes further suggested, "very probably the custom of carrying a [muzhu] into battle had developed from an earlier one of taking the body itself, and that therefore the [muzhu] was something representing the corpse, i.e., an image of the deceased."

Meaning (6) includes some semantically unrelated usages of ''shi''. ''Shi'' 尸 is an ancient place name (in [[Henan]]); a surname (e.g., the [[Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)|Syncretist]] philosopher [[Shizi (book)|Shizi]] 尸子, ca. 390–330 BCE); and a variant of ''shi'' [[Wikt:鳲|鳲]] (which is used in bird names like ''shijiu'' 鳲鳩 "cuckoo; turtledove").

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Standard Chinese]] ''shī'' pronunciation of 尸 phonologically descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" and ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian" (which anciently had interchangeable characters): ''śi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸and ''i'' &lt; *''djər'' 夷 ([[Bernhard Karlgren]] 1957), ''syij'' &lt; *''hljij'' 尸and ''yij'' &lt; *''ljɨj'' 夷 (William Baxter 1992), and ''śi'' &lt; *''lhi'' 尸 and ''ji'' &lt; *''ləi'' 夷 (Axel Schuessler 2009).

There are several hypothetical [[etymologies]] for ''shi'' "corpse". Karlgren proposed that ''si'' &lt; *''sjər'' 死 "die, dead" and ''shi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸 "the dead, corpse" were etymologically [[cognate]]. Paul K. Benedict (1972) suggested possible [[Proto-Sino-Tibetan]] roots for ''shi'': either *''(s-)raw'' "corpse; carcass" or *''siy'' "die". Schuessler (2007) hypothesizes a semantic development from *''li'' 夷 "extend; expose; display; set out; spread out" to *''lhi'' 尸 "to spread out; lie down flat (in order to sleep); motionless; to set forth (sacrificial dishes)", to "personator of a dead ancestor", to "corpse". He rejects Karlgren's assumption that ''shi'' "corpse" is cognate to ''si'' "to die", "because the MC [Middle Chinese] initial ''ś-'' (&lt; *''lh-'', *''nh-'', *''hj-'') never derives from an *''s-'', except when they share an initial *''l'' or *''n''."

===Translations===
English translations of the ceremonial ''shi'' 尸 include ''[[personator]]'', ''[[impersonator]]'', ''[[:wikt:representative|representative]]'', ''[[Mediumship|medium]]'', and ''[[shaman]]''. Carr reviews the choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously, rendering this into English is problematic because there is no Western analogy for the ceremonial ''shi'' 'corpse.' ''Personator'' is chosen as the nearest English translation. ''Impersonator'' would be possible, but this word implies falsehood, which was not originally associated with the ''shi''. ''Representative'' is too general in meaning, and does not usually have a sense of spirituality, unless modified by ''of the dead/ancestor''. Paper [1995] suggests ''Incorporator of the Dead'', which has a parallel 'one who embodies' etymology, but the derivate words ''incorporate'' and ''incorporation'' commonly have other meanings. ''Medium'' and ''shaman'' are similar with ''shi'' in meaning and are part of Chinese traditions; however, the descriptions of a dignified personator are unlike the spirit-possession of either. Another translational tactic would be to coin a [[nonce word]], such as Waley's [1937] "the Dead One," Eberhard's [1968] "death boy," or Wilhelm's [1967] "corpse boy," but the sense of such a coinage is not always clear. Therefore, in the absence of a better English word, ''personator'' will translate this meaning of ''shi''. (2007:364-365) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early descriptions==
Zhou Dynasty classic texts (c. 11th-3rd centuries BCE) use the word ''shi'' 尸 hundreds of times. Lothar von Falkenhausen contrasts the frequently recorded ''shi'' "personator" with the rarely noted [[Wu (shaman)|''wu'']] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] "shaman; spirit medium". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At ancestral sacrifices, the ancestral spirits descend into individuals designated from among their descendants, the "Impersonators" (''shi'' 尸). Occupying their ritual rôle by virtue of their kinship position vis-à-vis the ancestor that is sacrificed to, the Impersonators are not trained religious specialists like the Spirit Mediums. Although it has been speculated that the actions of the ''shi'' may have originally involved trance and possession, the surviving source materials — none earlier than the Western Zhou period — show them as staid and passive, acting with the utmost demeanor and dignity. (1995) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some early ''shi'' meanings are contextually ambiguous. For instance, the ''[[Yijing]]'' ("Book of Changes") uses ''yu shi'' [[Wikt:輿|輿]]尸 "carry corpses; corpse carrier" twice for [[I Ching hexagrams#Hexagram 7|Hexagram 7]] (tr. Wilhelm 1967:34-35): "Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon. Misfortune … Let the eldest lead the army. The younger transports corpses. Then perseverance brings misfortune." [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] summarizes the ''Yijing'' commentaries.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. (1967:34) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Marshall (2002:77) concludes this hexagram refers to carrying a corpse, and compares the "Israelites carrying the Ark of the Covenant into battle against the Philistines".

===Shijing===
The ''[[Shijing]]'' ("Classic of Poetry", ca. 11th-6th centuries BCE) contains early and detailed descriptions of personation ceremonies, in the following themes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an abundance of sacrificial wine and food (odes 166, 209, 210, and 248) shared by both the ancestral spirits (through the personator) and their descendants. Drunkenness is frequently mentioned: 209/5 "The spirits [note: 'souls' not 'liquor'] are all drunk," 209/6 "all are happy; they are drunk," 247/1, 2 "We are drunk with wine," and 248/5 "the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry." Most significantly, the ancestral spirits speak directly through the intoxicated personators (166, 210, and 247), approve of the sacrificial offerings, and bless their descendants (166, 209, 210, 247, and 248). (Carr 2007:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' "personator" occurs fourteen times in two pairs of consecutive ''Shijing'' odes (209–210 and 247–248, tr. Karlgren 1950:203-204). Ode 209 says "we make (the representative of the dead) sit at ease, we (assist him =) encourage him to eat" and "The august representative of the dead then rises, the drums and bells (by their sound) escort away the representative." The following ode 210 describes sacrificial wine and food, "he presents them  to our representative of the dead and to our guests."

''Shijing'' odes 247 and 248, which portray ancestral feasts to the Zhou royal house, exclusively use the term ''gongshi'' 公尸 with the modifier ''gong'' [[Wikt:公|公]] "prince; duke; public; palace; effort". Compare these ''gongshi'' translations: "representative of the (dead) princes" (Karlgren), "personators of your ancestors" (Legge, admitting 1895 IV:447, "The expression 公尸, 'ducal personators,' is somewhat difficult to account for"), "impersonator of the Ancient", "ducal Dead", or "Dead One" (Waley, noting 1937:215, "Impersonator of a former Duke or ruler"). Ode 247 (''Jizui'' 既醉 "Already Drunk") describes a sacrificial feast for ancestral spirits, and says "the representative of the (dead) princes makes a happy announcement".

Ode 248 (''Fuyi'' 鳧鷖 "Wild Ducks") describes another feast, which commentators say was held on the following day to reward the personator, and details sacrificial offerings and ancestral blessings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The wild ducks are on the [Jing] (river); the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is at peace; your wine is clear, your viands are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (achieve, complete you =) make you perfect. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the sands; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and (approves =) finds it good; your wine is plentiful, your viands are fine; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (act for =) favor you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the island; the representative of the (dead) prices comes and feasts and reposes; your wine is strained, your viands are sliced; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and descend on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are at the junction of the river; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is (treated in temple-fashion =) revered; the feast is in the temple, that is where felicity and blessings descend; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and are piled up (heavily =) amply on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are in the gorge; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry; the roast and broiled things are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; there will be no after trouble. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Shijing'', other texts refer to ''shi'' frequently drinking sacrificial [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|''jiu'']] 酒 "alcoholic beverage; liquor", which Paper (1995:113) interprets as a ritual means to induce hallucinations of ancestral spirits. Based upon a ''Liji'' ceremony (tr. Legge 1885 28:246) describing a ''shi'' personator drinking nine cups of ''jiu'', with an estimated alcohol content from 5% to 8%, and volume measurements of Zhou bronze sacrificial cups, Paper (1995:114) calculates a "conservative estimate is that the ''shi'' consumed between 2.4 and 3.9 ounces of pure alcohol (equivalent to between 5 and 8 bar shots of eighty-proof liquor)."

===Child personators===
Several texts refer to a Chinese custom that a personator should be a child of the same sex as the dead ancestor, preferably either a legitimate grandson or his wife. However, personation by younger relatives, who were of lower [[social status]] than their elders, created an exception to traditional Chinese culture. The earliest textual reference comes from the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'' ("Book of Mencius") questioning the status shown to a younger brother during the personation ceremony.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should ask him, "Which do you respect most, — your uncle, or your younger brother?" He will answer, "My uncle." Ask him again, "If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect, — to him or to your uncle?" He will say, "To my younger brother." You can go on, "But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?" He will reply to this, "I show the respect to my younger brother because of the position which he occupies." (6, tr. Legge 1895 IV:400). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Liji'' reiterates that personation contradicted the established social hierarchy (18, tr. Legge 1895 28:88): "Thus it is that there are two among his subjects whom the ruler does not treat as subjects. When one is personating (his ancestor) he does not treat him as such, nor does he treat his master as such." Another ''Liji'' passage (7, tr. Legge 1895 27:337-338) explains: "A rule of propriety says, 'A superior man may carry his grandson in his arms, but not his son.' This tells us that a grandson may be the personator of his deceased grandfather (at sacrifices), but a son cannot be so of his father." When a grandson personated his grandfather's spirit, it reversed the normal family hierarchy and a father would have to worship his own son. 

Scholars have differing hypotheses explaining why a grandchild would make the most suitable personator. [[Marcel Granet]] (1930:337–338) said the basic reason was a predominance of uterine over agnatic [[primogeniture]]; the grandfather is the closest of the uterine relatives, and thus closer to his grandson than the father is. [[Wolfram Eberhard]] (1968:338) explained that a child makes the best personator owing to the ancient Chinese believed that a soul is small. [[Julian Jaynes]] (1976:344–345) mentions a Greek parallel; the philosopher [[Iamblichus]] wrote that "young and simple persons" make the most suitable mediums. Stephen Bokenkamp mentions examples besides ''shi'' rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In China, possessions by spirits that occurred outside of this ritual scenario often involved younger members of the family as well. As in instances of mediumism around the world, the youthful and illiterate were regarded as more reliable conduits to the dead, since they could hardly be suspected of having fabricated their utterances and writings themselves. This fact brings to the fore questions of power. Women and junior male members of a family frequently found that mediumism was a way to bring attention to their own, otherwise easily ignored, concerns. (2007:40) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Female personators===
Two ritual texts mention female personators. The ''Liji'' (15, tr. Legge 1885 28:75) describes a wife personating her husband's dead grandmother: "A wife, on festive occasions, even though it were on receiving a gift from the ruler, (only) made a curtsy. When seated as a personatrix (of the deceased grandmother of her husband), she did not bow with her head to her hands, but made the curtsy." The ''Yili'' (14, tr. Steele 1917:119.) euphemistically says a female personator should preferably not be the wife of a concubine's grandson; "A man personates a dead man, and a woman a woman. In the latter case a woman of a different surname is chosen, and as such not one of inferior standing."

===Historical changes in personation===
Several early texts and commentaries reiterate a traditional history of personation beginning in the second millennium BCE as a sacred communion with ancestral spirits, but ending as a drinking party in the late 1st millennium BCE. When the personation ceremony supposedly originated during the [[Xia Dynasty]] (ca. 2100-ca. 1600 BCE), a personator would make contact with the dead ancestral spirit before sitting down to eat and drink. During the Yin or Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), a personator would sometimes sit down without having contacted the spirit, and by the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE), a personation ceremony became a revelry with several personators repeatedly making toasts and drinking sacrificial wines.

Two ''Liji'' chapters describe how personation rituals changed during the Zhou period.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the [Zhou] dynasty the representatives of the dead sat. Their monitors and cup-suppliers observed no regular rules. The usages were the same (as those of Yin [Shang]), and the underlying principle was one. Under the [Xia] dynasty, the personators had stood till the sacrifice was ended (whereas) under the Yin [Shang] they sat. Under [Zhou], when the cup went round among all, there were six personators. [Zengzi] said, "The usages of [Zhou] might be compared to a subscription club." (10, tr. Legge 1885 27:405-406) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(When the representative of the departed) had made the libation with the [jia] cup, or the horn, (the sacrificer) was told (to bow to him) to put him at ease. Anciently, the representative stood when nothing was being done; when anything was being done, he sat. He personated the spirit. The officer of prayer was the medium of communication between him and the sacrificer. (11, tr. Legge 1885 27:446) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later sources repeat this legendary history of personation. For example, He Xiu 何休's 2nd-century commentary to the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals|Chunqiu]]'' ("Spring and Autumn Annals") ''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]'' says (tr. Carr 2007:371), "The Xia had standing personators, the Shang [Yin] had sitting personators, and the Zhou had six personators who would make serial toasts." Granet (1930:337) mentions the Zhou personation parties: "It was not long before this archaic custom was criticized by the ritualists. When the sacrifices were offered simultaneously to several ancestors each of whom was represented, the ceremony was found indeed to assume a displeasing likeness to a picnic."

===Doubts about personation===
The above ''Liji'' description of Zhou "subscription club" personation ceremonies quotes [[Confucius]]'s student and compiler [[Zengzi]] (505-436 BCE). The ''Liji'' contains three passages where Zengzi questions his teacher about whether personators were needed for ancestral rituals. For instance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Zengzi] asked, "Is it necessary that there should be a representative of the dead in sacrifices? Or may he be dispensed with as when the satisfying offerings are made to the dead?" Confucius said, "In sacrificing to a full-grown man for whom there have been the funeral rites, there must be such a representative, who should be a grandson; and if the grandson is too young, someone must be employed to carry him in his arms. If there be no grandson, some one of the same surname should be selected for the occasion. In sacrificing to the one who had died prematurely, there are (only) the satisfying offerings, for he was not full-grown. To sacrifice to a full-grown man, for whom there have been the funeral rites without a representative, would be to treat him as if he had died prematurely." (7, tr. Legge 1885 27:337-338) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hypothetical origins ==
Chinese scholars have long disagreed about when and how ''shi'' personation originated. Henri Doré (1914 1:99-102) summarizes the four principal opinions, which are worth quoting in full.

The first opinion is that personation was a bygone superstition. The [[Tang Dynasty]] historian [[Du You]] criticizes the ''shi'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients employed a personator. This rite deserves censure, and has been abolished by our great Worthies. One vied with the other in practicing it. Now that an era of progress has set in, and these silly customs have disappeared, it is important not to revive them; common sense bids to refrain from them. Some half-baked literati of our days would fain re-establish this ceremony of the personator. This is quite absurd. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second opinion is that the personator was not the agent of the departed, but merely its metaphorical representative or ''shenxiang'' 神象 "image of the spirit". The [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Ban Gu]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The personator is found in the ceremony wherein sacrifice is offered to ancestors, because the soul emitting no perceptible sounds and having no visible form, the loving sentiment of filial piety finds no means of displaying itself, hence a personator has been chosen to whom meats are offered, after which he breaks the bowls, quite rejoiced, as if his own father had eaten plenty. The personator, drinking abundantly, imparts the illusion that it is the soul which is satiated. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Carr (2007:386) notes, "This passage sounds as though Ban had personally observed a personation ceremony."    
   
Some [[Qing Dynasty]] scholars held a third opinion, namely, that the personator was bearer of the ancestral tablet. The ''Jishuo quanzhen'' 集說詮真 "Collected Sayings Explaining Truth" says, "The filial son chooses a personator to carry the tablet, but not to be the resting place of the soul of the dead person. His intention is therefore manifest." The ''Yuzhou dayiyi'' 宇宙大疑議 "Discussion of Universal Great Doubts" says: "The personator is employed during sacrifices to the dead, in order to carry the ancestral tablet … hence there is no need of having such a one immediately after death, as the tablet is not yet erected."

The fourth opinion refutes the first three condemnations of personators as mere representatives or tablet-holders for the dead, and contends that a personator was temporarily the seat of a dead ancestor's soul. Two leading [[Neo-Confucianist]] philosophers held this judgment.
[[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients, when sacrificing to the dead, employed the personator, because the soul and the vital force of the dead person after being separated from the body, seek an agent of the same nature. Now, men being all of the same kind, the father and the children being all of one family and of the same stock, the soul of the departed person is requested to come and establish its seat in one of them as in an agent. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
His follower [[Zhu Xi]] concurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times all employed a personator when sacrificing to the dead. Since the descendants continue the life of their ancestors, the personator shares, therefore, in the life of the departed person, and the ancestor's soul descends undoubtedly upon his descendants, and reposes therein to enjoy the sacrifice offered. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carr (2007:387-388) offers a contemporary explanation for ''shi'' "corpse" personation: [[Julian Jaynes]]'s psychological [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]] hypothesis. Jaynes proposed that human "[[consciousness]]", meaning [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]], began evolving around 1000 BCE. Prior to that, ancient people had "bicameral mentality" in which one part of the brain "spoke" (often in an [[authority figure]]'s voice) while another part listened and obeyed. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the theory of the bicameral mind, hallucinations of a person in some authority could continue after death as an everyday matter. And hence the almost universal custom of feeding the corpses after death, and burying them with the appurtenances of life. (Jaynes 1976:290) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
If the original personators were bicameral, they could have directly hallucinated voices from a ''shi'' "corpse". Carr notes the historical correspondence between Jaynes's first millennium BCE timeline for the breakdown of the bicameral mind in other parts of the world and the 11th-3rd centuries BCE personation practices in China.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several early sources give variations of the same chronicle about the personation ceremony. It began during the Xia Dynasty, when personators would communicate on behalf of the dead; continued during the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties; but was criticized and discontinued after the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when personators were no longer able to speak for the dead. (2007:387) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:SanXingDui ZongMuMianJu.jpg|thumb|[[Sanxingdui]] bronze mask]]
Wearing [[Ritual mask#Ritual masks|ritual masks]] is a recent hypothesis about ''shi''. Paper (1995:82) suggested the possibility that Shang and Zhou ''shi'' wore bronze masks "symbolizing the spirit of the dead to whom the sacrifices were offered". Liu believes the phantasmagoric bronze masks discovered at [[Sanxingdui]], dating from c. 12th-11th centuries BCE, might have been ritually worn by ''shi'' 尸.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''shi'' was generally a close, young relative who wore a costume (possibly including a mask) reproducing the features of the dead person. The ''shi'' was an impersonator, that is, a person serving as a reminder of the ancestor to whom sacrifice was being offered. During such a ceremony, the impersonator was much more than an actor in a drama. Although the exact meaning may have been different, the group of Sanxingdui masked figures in bronze all have the character of an impersonator. It is likely the masks were used to impersonate and identify with certain supernatural beings in order to effect some communal good. (2000:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History, format and structure ==
The cover story of the magazine's very first issue paid tribute to [[scientist]] and [[science-fiction]] writer [[Isaac Asimov]].
&lt;ref name=Skeptic1&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv01n1&amp;Category_Code=BIA "Vol. 1 No.1 (Premiere Issue) Tribute to Isaac Asimov"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As Asimov wrote a number of stories featuring robots and coined the term "[[robotics]]", the cover of volume 12, #2 (2006), which is devoted to the topic of artificial intelligence, depicts a [[robot]] sitting on a park bench reading that first issue.&lt;ref name="Skeptic2"&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv12n2 "Vol. 12 No. 2 Artificial Intelligence"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every issue of the magazine opens with a description of The Skeptics Society and its mission statement, which is to explore subjects such as [[creationism]], [[pyramid power]], [[Bigfoot]], [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical claims]] (as in the examples of [[Holocaust denial]] and extreme [[Afrocentrism]]), the use or misuse of theory and [[statistics]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[urban myths]], [[witch-hunt]]s, [[mass hysterias]], [[genius]] and [[intelligence]], and cultural influences on science, as well as controversies involving [[protoscience]]s at the leading edge of established science, and even [[fads]] like [[cryonics]] and [[low-carb diet]]s.  In addition to publishing the magazine, the Society also:

* sponsors lecture series at the [[California Institute of Technology]]
* produces and sells tapes of the lectures, as well as other books on pertinent subjects
* holds field trips to investigate and research such subjects
* conducts social events to promote good-will
* provides resources for the public, skeptic organizations (such as [[SkeptiCamp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepticamp.org | title=Skepticamp | accessdate =2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the media, with which they may approach controversial subjects from a skeptical viewpoint

In 2011, the magazine had three regular columnists: [[James Randi]] wrote "’Twas Brillig…," [[Harriet A. Hall]] wrote "The Skep Doc" and [[Karen Stollznow]] wrote "Bad Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Table of Contents | magazine=Skeptic | publisher=Skeptics Society | url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol16n02.html | volume=16 | issue=2 | accessdate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine's page count was between approximately 100 and 110 pages until the 2010s. It was reduced to approximately 80 pages with Vol. 16 No. 3 (2011).{{CN|date=March 2018}} {{As of |2018}}, the magazine had two regular columnists: Harriet A. Hall and [[Carol Tavris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptic: CURRENT ISSUE: VOLUME 23 NUMBER 1|url=https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|website=skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330232530/https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|archivedate=30 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typical topics ===
Each issue features an [[editorial]]. In the past this was provided by [[James Randi]], and was often a reaction to stories from mainstream news media such as the 2005 story by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[newsmagazine]] ''[[Primetime Live]]'' featuring a [[Brazil]]ian [[faith healer]], [[João de Deus (medium)|João Teixeira]].{{CN|date=March 2018}} Other times Randi wrote about topics he had investigated in the past, such as alleged [[dowser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-08-31/#feature/|title = A Report from the Paranormal Trenches|website=Skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|date = 2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged [[psychic]]s like [[Sylvia Browne]], and UFOs.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The magazine also features a large correspondence section called "Forum". This includes not only letters from lay readers but also in-depth comments and rebuttals from [[professional]]s, contributing to extended academic debate across issues raised in past editions.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The bulk of the magazine treats a variety of topics. [[Front cover|Cover stories]] have ranged from examination of alleged [[UFO]]s in [[religious icons]] and theories of the likelihood of [[artificial intelligence]] to tributes to luminaries such as [[Isaac Asimov]]&lt;ref name=Skeptic1/&gt; and [[Ernst Mayr]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sulloway, Frank J.]] (February 2005). [http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-02-11/ "Ernst Mayr, 1904–2005Remembrances &amp; Tribute"]. ''Skeptic''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some editions feature special sections devoted to a particular topic or theme that is examined through multiple articles by different authors, such as [[intelligent design]] - a frequently recurring topic in the magazine, given the ongoing [[creation vs. evolution controversy]].{{CN|date=March 2018}}

=== ''Junior Skeptic'' ===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:JuniorSkeptic.jpg|thumb|right|''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, and is written and illustrated in a manner more appealing to children]] --&gt;
Bound into most issues is a 10-page young-readers' section called ''[[Junior Skeptic]]''.  Heralded by a cover printed on glossy paper (the rest of the magazine is printed on non-glossy stock), ''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, or provides practical instruction written and illustrated in a style more appealing to children.

[[Daniel Loxton]] is the Editor of ''Junior Skeptic''. He writes and illustrates most issues.

The first edition of ''Junior Skeptic'' appeared in volume 6, #2 of ''Skeptic'' (2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15041">'''Spiritual direction''' is the practice of being with people as they attempt to deepen their relationship with the [[divinity|divine]], or to learn and grow in their own personal [[spirituality]].  The person seeking direction shares stories of his or her encounters of the divine, or how he or she is cultivating a life attuned to spiritual things.  The director listens and asks questions to assist the directee in his or her process of [[Introspection|reflection]] and spiritual growth. Spiritual direction advocates claim that it develops a deeper awareness with the spiritual aspect of being human, and that it is not [[psychotherapy]], counseling, or financial planning.

== Forms ==
While there is some degree of variability, there are primarily two forms of spiritual direction: regular direction and [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] direction. They differ largely in the frequency of meeting and in the intensity of reflection.

Regular direction can involve a one- to two-hour meeting every four to eight weeks, and thus is slightly less intense than retreat direction, although spiritual exercises and disciplines are often given for the directee to attempt between meetings.

If the directee is on a retreat (lasting a weekend, a week or even 40 days), he or she will generally meet with his or her director on a daily basis for one hour. During these daily meetings, exercises or spiritual disciplines such as [[lectio divina]] are given to the directee as fodder to continue his or her spiritual growth. Alternatively, retreat centres often offer direction or companionship to persons visiting the centre alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivendellretreat.org/personal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510043839/http://www.rivendellretreat.org/personal.html |archivedate=2012-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola]] are a popular example of guidelines used for spiritual direction.

== Historical traditions ==

=== Western Christianity ===
Within [[Christianity]], spiritual direction has its roots in [[early Church|Early Christianity]].  The [[gospel]]s describe [[Jesus]] serving as a mentor to his disciples. Additionally, [[The Book of Acts|Acts of the Apostles]] Chapter 9 describes Ananias helping [[Paul of Tarsus]] to grow in his newfound experience of Christianity.  Likewise, several of the [[Pauline epistles]] describe Paul mentoring both Timothy and Titus among others.  Tradition tells us that [[John the Evangelist]] tutored [[Polycarp]], the 2nd-century bishop of [[Smyrna]].

Theologian [[John Cassian]] who lived in the 4th century provided some of the earliest recorded guidelines on the Christian practice of spiritual direction.&lt;ref name=christ&gt;{{cite web | title = Got Your 'Spiritual Director' Yet? |publisher= [[Christianity Today]] | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/aprilweb-only/4-28-51.0.html?paging=off 
|date=April 1, 2003| accessdate = 2014-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced mentoring in the monasteries. Each novice was put under the care of an older monk. [[Benedict of Nursia]] integrated Cassian's guidelines into what is now known as the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]].

Spiritual direction is widespread in the Catholic religion: a person with wisdom and spiritual discernment, usually but not exclusively a priest or consecrated in general, provides counsel to a person who wishes to make a journey of faith and discovery of God's will in his life. The spiritual guide aims to discern, understand what the Holy Spirit, through the situations of life, spiritual insights fruit of prayer, reading and meditation on the Bible, tells the person accompanied. The spiritual father or spiritual director may provide advice, give indications of life and prayer, resolving doubts in matters of faith and morals without replacing the choices and decisions to the person accompanying.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
Eastern Orthodoxy comes from the same pre-schism traditions, but the role of a "spiritual director" or "elder" in Orthodoxy has maintained its important role.  The original Greek term geron (meaning "elder", as in gerontology) was rendered by the Russian word [[starets]], from Old Church Slavonic starĭtsĭ, "elder", derived from starŭ, "old". The Greek tradition has a long unbroken history of elders and disciples, such as [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] and [[John Moschos]] in the seventh century, [[Symeon the Studite|Symeon the Elder]] and [[Symeon the New Theologian]] in the eleventh century, and contemporary charismatic gerontes such as [[Porphyrios (Bairaktaris) of Kafsokalivia|Porphyrios]] and [[Paisios (Eznepidis)|Paisios]]. [[Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[Nil Sorsky]] were two most venerated startsy of Old [[Muscovy]]. The revival of elders in the Slavic world is associated with the name of [[Paisius Velichkovsky]] (1722–94), who produced the Russian translation of the [[Philokalia]]. The most famous Russian starets of the early 19th century was [[Seraphim of Sarov]] (1759-1833), who went on to become one of the most revered Orthodox saints.
The [[Optina Pustyn]] near [[Kozelsk]] used to be celebrated for its startsy (Schema-Archimandrite Moses, Schema-Hegumen Anthony, Hieroschemamonk Leonid, Hieroschemamonk Macarius, Hieroschemamonk Hilarion, Hieroschemamonk Ambrose, Hieroschemamonk Anatole (Zertsalov)).[1] Such writers as [[Nikolay Gogol]], [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Konstantin Leontyev]] sought advice from the elders of this monastery. They also inspired the figure of Zosima in Dostoyevsky's novel [[The Brothers Karamazov]]. A more modern example of a starets is Archimandrite [[John Krestiankin]] (1910-2006) of the [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]] who was popularly recognized as such by many [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] living in [[Russia]].

=== Judaism ===
In [[Judaism]], the Hebrew term for spiritual director differs among traditional communities. The verb ''Hashpa'ah'' is common in some communities though not all; the spiritual director called a ''mashpi'a'' occurs in the [[Habad]]-Lubavitch community and also in the [[Jewish Renewal]] community. A  ''mashgiakh ruchani'' is the equivalent role among [[mitnagedim]] (adherents of the ''[[Musar movement|mussar]]'' tradition). The purpose of hashpa'ah is to support the directee in her or his personal relationship with God, and to deepen that person's ability to find God's presence in ordinary life. Amongst [[Lubavitchers]] this draws on the literature and praxis of [[Hasidism]] as it is practiced according to Habad standards, and to Jewish mystical tradition generally. Spiritual mentorship is customary in the Hasidic world, but not necessarily in the same way.

=== Sufism ===
In [[Sufism]], the term used for spiritual master is ''[[murshid]]'', Arabic for "guide" or "teacher". He is more than a spiritual director and believed to be guiding the disciples based on his direct connectivity with the Divine. The murshid's role is to spiritually guide and verbally instruct the disciple on the Sufi path after the disciple takes an oath of allegiance or [[Bay'ah]] (''bai'ath'') with him. The concept of Murshid Kamil Akmal (also known as Insan-e-Kamil) is significant in most [[tariqa]]s. The doctrine states that from pre-existence till pre-eternity, there shall always remain a [[Qutb]] or a Universal Man upon the earth who would be the perfect manifestation of God and at the footsteps of the Islamic prophet [[Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="Murshid Kamil Akmal (Perfect Spiritual Guide)"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman|title=Perfect Spiritual Guide (Murshid-e-Kamil Akmal) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVxlAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=murshid+kamil+akmal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=murshid%20kamil%20akmal&amp;f=false|publisher=Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supererogation''' ([[Latin|Late Latin]]: ''supererogatio'' "payment beyond what is due or asked", from ''super'' "beyond" and ''erogare'' "to pay out, expend", itself from ''ex'' "out" and ''rogare'' "to ask") is the performance of more than is asked for; the action of doing more than [[duty]] requires. In [[ethics]], an act is '''supererogatory''' if it is good but not morally required to be done. It refers to an act that is more than is necessary, when another course of action—involving less—would still be an acceptable action. It differs from a duty, which is an act wrong not to do, and from acts morally neutral. Supererogation may be considered as performing above and beyond a normative course of duty to further benefits and functionality.

==In Catholicism==
In the [[theology]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], "works of supererogation" (also called "acts of supererogation") are those performed beyond what God requires. For example, in [[1 Corinthians 7]], [[Paul the Apostle]] says that while everyone is free to marry, it is better to refrain from marriage and remain celibate to better serve God. The Roman Catholic Church holds that the [[counsels of perfection]] are supererogatory acts, which specific [[Christian]]s may engage in above their moral duties. Similarly, it teaches that to determine how to act, one must engage in reasonable efforts to be sure of what the right actions are; after the reasonable action, the person is in a state of [[vincible ignorance|invincible ignorance]] and guiltless of wrongdoing, but to undertake more than reasonable actions to overcome ignorance is supererogatory, and praiseworthy.

According to the classic teaching on [[indulgence]]s, the works of supererogation performed by all the saints form a treasure with God, the "[[treasury of merit,]]" which the church can apply to exempt [[repentance (Christianity)|repentant]] sinners from the works of [[penance|penitence]] that would otherwise be required of them to achieve full reconciliation with the church.

==In Protestantism==
[[Martin Luther]]'s opposition of this teaching seeded the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Church of England]] denied the doctrine of supererogation in the fourteenth of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], which states that works of supererogation

&lt;blockquote&gt;
cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they not only render unto God as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer_(ECUSA)/Historical_Documents_of_the_Church/Articles_of_Religion Book of Common Prayer (ECUSA)/Historical Documents of the Church/Articles of Religion. XIV.  Of Works of Supererogation.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Protestant movements followed suit, such as in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]].

==In Islam==
A [[Muslim]] must complete a minimum of the [[Salah#The Five Daily Prayers|five daily prayers]], each typically lasting an average of 5 to 10 minutes. Supererogatory prayers beyond these are known as [[Nafl prayer|nafl]] prayers, and praying them is considered to bear additional reward. There are also several other supererogatory acts in [[Islam]], such as fasting outside of the month of [[Ramadhan]], or giving [[sadaqah]] (charity, consisting of simple acts of kindness to financial assistance) that is not obligatory.

==Discussion==
Whether an act is supererogatory or obligatory can be debated. In many schools of thought, donating money to [[Charitable organization|charity]] is supererogatory. In other schools of thought that regard some level of charitable donation to be duty (such as with the [[tithe]] in [[Judaism]], [[zakat]] in Islam, and similar standards in many Christian sects), only exceeding a certain level of donation (e.g. going above the common 2.5%-of-capital-assets standard in zakat) would count as supererogatory.

In [[criminal law]], it may be observed that state prohibitions on killing, stealing, and so on derive from the state's duty to protect one's own citizens. However, a nation state has no duty to protect the citizens of an adjacent nation from crime. To send a [[peacekeeping]] force into another country would be — in the view of the nation doing it — supererogatory.

Some schools of ethics do not include supererogatory acts. In [[utilitarianism]], an act can only be better because it would bring more good to a greater number, and in that case it becomes a duty, not a supererogatory act. The lack of a notion of supererogation in utilitarianism and related schools leads to the [[demandingness objection]], arguing that these schools are too ethically demanding, requiring unreasonable acts.

In Christian theology, a '''supernatural gift''' is a gift of God that is conferred on man that is above all the powers of created nature.&lt;reF&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Supernatural Gift}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the gift of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] which enables man to attain salvation despite [[original sin]].

'''Swami Satyabhakta''' ({{lang-hi|स्वामी सत्यभक्त}}) (born as '''Darbarilal'''; 10 November 1899 – 10 December 1998) was a scholar, philosopher, reformer and the founder of  Satya Samaj.&lt;ref&gt;In The Mirror Of My Memories, Life Of Pandit Nathu Ram Premi: Scholar And Social Reformer, by Pandit Sukhlal Sanghvi, Jain Jagaran ke Agraduta, Bharatiya Jnanapitha, 1952, p. 267-268&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born Mulchanda at Shahpur, [[Sagar district|Sagar]], he moved to [[Damoh]] to his aunt's house after the death of his mother at age 4, where he was renamed Darbarilal. He met [[Ganeshprasad Varni]] at [[Damoh]] and influenced by him, he joined the pathshala established by Varniji at Sagar. At age 19, he graduated with the title Nyayatirth and became a teacher at Sdyavad Vdyalaya at [[Varanasi]] for a year. He then moved to [[Seoni]] and then Indore, where he developed his rationalistic principles.

In 1923, he became a reformer.&lt;ref&gt;Sadhu Satyasnehi, Sankshipt Jivan Parichaya, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[Bombay]] during 1926-1936, where he edited Jain Jagat and Jain Prakash. He started writing a series of articles that were later compiled into Jain Dharma Samiksha.&lt;ref&gt;Jain Dharma Samiksha, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually moved to [[Wardha]] in 1936 and established his Ashrama there.

== Works ==

He was a prolific author. His writings include Buddhahridayam,&lt;ref&gt;Buddhahridayam, Siddayya, Shaik, Satyabhakta, Darbarilal,1967&lt;/ref&gt; Jain Dharma Mimansa,&lt;ref&gt;Jain Dharma Mimansa, Darbarilal Satyabhakt, Satya Samaj Granthamala, Bombay, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Mahavira Ka Antahsthal,&lt;ref&gt;Mahavira Ka Antahsthal, Satyashram Wardha, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Manav Bhasha,&lt;ref&gt;Hindī Vyākaraṇa Kā Itihāsa, Ananta Caudharī,

He also composed a set of prayers towards Satyar deities, published as Satya Sangita.  He wrote a text Nirativada on social economics, that advocated an economic system that avoids the extremes of marxism and Capitalism.

      <comment>The use of [sic] here is bizarre, and implies that the usage is incorrect when it is not.  Anyone who doesn't know the meanings of the verb "to bear" can look it up in a dictionary.  And why would it be marked with a [sic] in Mormon usage, but not in the reference to Quaker usage?</comment>

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]] and in [[religion]], '''testimony''' is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The words "testimony" and "testify" both derive from the [[Latin]] word ''testis'', referring to the notion of a disinterested [[Third-party source|third-party]] witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testify|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testify |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testimony|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testimony |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

In the [[law]], testimony is a form of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that is obtained from a [[witness]] who makes a solemn statement or declaration of fact. Testimony may be oral or written, and it is usually made by [[oath]] or [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] under penalty of [[perjury]]. To be admissible in court and for maximum reliability and validity, written testimony is usually witnessed by one or more persons who swear or affirm its authenticity also under penalty of perjury. Unless a witness is testifying as an [[expert witness]], testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is generally limited to those opinions or inferences that are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony. 

Legitimate expert witnesses with a genuine understanding of legal process and the inherent dangers of false or misleading testimony refrain from making statements of fact. They also recognize that they are in fact not witnesses to an alleged crime or other event in any way, shape or form. Their expertise is in the examination of evidence or relevant facts in the case. They should make no firm judgement or claim or accusation about any aspect of the case outside their narrow range of expertise. They also should not allege any fact they can't immediately and credibly prove scientifically.
 
For example, a hair sample from a crime scene entered as evidence by the prosecution should be described by an expert witness as "consistent with" a sample collected from the defendant, rather than being described as a "match". A wide range of factors make it physically impossible to prove for certain that two hair or tissue samples came from a common source.

Having not actually witnessed the defendant at the scene, the expert witness can not state for a fact that the sample is a match to the defendant, particularly when the samples were collected at different times and different places by different collectors using different collection methods. Ultimately, the testimony of expert witnesses is regarded as supportive of evidence rather than evidence in and of itself, and a good defense attorney will point out that the expert witness is not in fact a witness to anything, but rather an observer.

When a witness is asked a question, the opposing attorney can raise an [[Objection (law)|objection]], which is a legal move to disallow or prevent an improper question to others, preferably before the witness answers, and mentioning one of the standard reasons, including:
* argumentative
* asked and answered
* [[best evidence rule]]
* calls for speculation
* calls for a conclusion
* [[compound question]] or narrative
* [[hearsay]]
* inflammatory
* incompetent witness (e.g., child, mental or physical impairment, intoxicated)
* irrelevant, immaterial (the words "irrelevant" and "immaterial" have the same meaning under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Historically, irrelevant evidence referred to evidence that has no probative value, i.e., does not tend to prove any fact. Immaterial refers to evidence that is probative, but not as to any fact material to the case. See Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Ed.).
* lack of foundation
* [[leading question]]
* [[privilege (evidence)|privilege]]
* vague
* [[ultimate issue (law)|ultimate issue testimony]]
There may also be an objection to the answer, including:
* non-responsive

Up until the mid-20th century, in much of the [[United States]], an attorney often had to follow an objection with an '''exception''' to preserve the issue for appeal. If an attorney failed to "take an exception" immediately after the court's ruling on the objection, he waived his client's right to appeal the issue. Exceptions have since been abolished, due to the widespread recognition that forcing lawyers to take them was a waste of time.

When a party uses the testimony of a witness to show proof, the opposing party often attempts to [[Witness impeachment|impeach]] the witness. This may be done using [[cross-examination]], calling into question the witness's [[Competence (law)|competence]], or by attacking the [[Character evidence|character]] or [[Habit evidence|habit]] of the witness. So, for example, if a witness testifies that he remembers seeing a person at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday and his habit is to be at his desk job on Tuesday, then the opposing party would try to impeach his testimony related to that event.

==Religion==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fasting]] --&gt;
[[Christians]] in general, especially within the [[Evangelical]] tradition, use the term "to testify" or "to give one's testimony" to mean "to tell the story of how one became a Christian". Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian's life in which they believe God did something deemed particularly worth sharing. Christians often give their testimony at their own [[baptism]] or at [[evangelistic]] events. Many Christians have also published their testimonies on the internet.

===Types===
Many [[Holiness movement|holiness]] churches devote a portion of their mid-week service to allow members to give a personal testimony about their faith and experiences in living the Christian life.

In the [[Religious Society of Friends]], the word ''testimony'' is used to refer to the ways in which [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] ''testify'' or ''bear witness'' to their beliefs in their everyday lives. In this context, the word ''testimony'' refers not to the underlying belief, but the committed action which arises out of their beliefs, which ''testifies'' to their beliefs. Common areas which modern [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] are said to testify are [[peace testimony|testimony towards peace]], [[testimony of simplicity|testimony to simplicity]], [[testimony of integrity|testimony to truth and integrity]], [[testimony of equality|testimony to equality]].

In some [[religion]]s (most notably [[Mormonism]] and [[Islam]]) many adherents testify as a profession of their [[faith]], often to a congregation of believers. In [[Mormonism]], testifying is also referred to as "bearing one's testimony," and often involves the sharing of personal experience—ranging from a simple anecdote to an account of [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelation]]—followed by a statement of belief that has been confirmed by this experience. Within [[Mormon]] [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]], the word "testimony"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://lds.org/study/topics/testimony?lang=eng |contribution= Testimony |title= Gospel Study: Study by Topic |work= LDS.org |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |date= |accessdate= 2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become synonymous with "belief." Although testimony and belief are often used interchangeably, they are inherently different. Most Mormons believe that when faith is acted upon, individuals can receive a spiritual witness which solidifies belief into testimony. Mormons are taught that if the exercise of faith brings forth good works, they can know their religious principles are true. An individual who no longer believes in the religion is referred to as having "lost their testimony."

==Literature==
[[File:Bataan Death March Testimonies.jpg|thumb|[[Bataan Death March|Bataan Death March Testimonies]]]]
Some published [[oral history|oral]] or written [[autobiography|autobiographical]] [[narrative]]s are considered "testimonial [[literature]]" particularly when they present [[evidence (law)|evidence]] or [[first-person narrative|first person]] accounts of [[human rights]] abuses, [[violence]] and [[war]], and living under conditions of social [[oppression]]. This usage of the term comes originally from [[Latin America]] and the Spanish term ''"testimonio"'' when it emerged from human rights [[tribunal]]s,  [[truth commissions]], and other [[international human rights instruments]] in countries such as [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. One of the most famous, though controversial, of these works to be translated into English is ''[[I, Rigoberta Menchú]]''. The autobiographies of [[Frederick Douglass]] can be considered among the earliest significant English-language works in this [[genre]].

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], a testimony is known as statements that are based on personal experience or personal knowledge. A statement is accepted on the basis of person's testimony if his or her asserting it renders it acceptable. We can also, rationally accept a claim on the basis of another person's testimony unless at least one of the following is found to be true:
# The claim is implausible;
# The person or the source in which the [[Cause of action|claim]] is quoted lacks [[credibility]];
# The claim goes beyond what the person could know from his or her own [[experience]] and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A practical study of Argument|edition=6th|author=[[Trudy Govier]]|origyear=1985|year=2005|isbn=9780534605254}} For the notion of testimony in general, and especially after David Hume, see the seminal research by C. A. J. Coady, Testimony: A Philosophical Study, Oxford 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matheson Trust associates have included, among others, [[Martin Lings]], [[Gai Eaton|Charles Le Gai Eaton]], [[William Stoddart]] and [[Reza Shah-Kazemi]].

== Matheson Monographs ==

Since 2008, The Matheson Trust had been co-producing publications with a number of kindred organisations and established publishers: The Prometheus Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prometheustrust.co.uk/index.html |title=Prometheus Trust |publisher=Prometheus Trust |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fons Vitae&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fonsvitae.com/ |title=fonsvitae.com |publisher=fonsvitae.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (KY), Archetype UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archetype.uk.com/home.htm |title=Archetype Home |publisher=Archetype.uk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but December 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel Zinner |url=http://samuelzinner.blogspot.com/ |title=See Samuel Zinner's blog announcement |publisher=Samuelzinner.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the launch of an independent series, the "Matheson Monographs", covering "scriptural exegesis, the modalities of spiritual and contemplative life, studies of particular religious traditions, comparative analyses, studies of traditional arts, crafts and cosmological sciences, contemporary scholarly expositions of religious philosophy and metaphysics, translations of both classical and contemporary texts and transcriptions of lectures by, and interviews with, spiritual and scholarly authorities from different religious and philosophical traditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/publications/index.php#copublications |title=Publications |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matheson Library ==

In March 2011 the Matheson Trust website was launched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/announce/2011/03/04/matheson-website-launched/ |title=Matheson Website Launched — The Matheson Trust |publisher=Themathesontrust.org |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting an online library of free selected books and articles, almost exclusively in English, including authors and sources as varied as [[Abdallah Bin Bayyah|Shaykh Abdallah Bin Bayyah]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/ |title=archbishopofcanterbury.org |publisher=archbishopofcanterbury.org |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Berzin]] archives, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Jonathan Sacks|Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks]], [[James Cutsinger]], [[Gavin D'Costa]], [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], [[Harry Oldmeadow]], the journal [[Ali Lakhani|Sacred Web]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Timothy Winter]] (Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad), [[The Woolf Institute of Abrahamic Faiths]] and others. Documents are free to browse and download, most in [[PDF]] format, with a few articles in HTML.&lt;br /&gt;

As of October 2018, there are more than 600 holdings in the library, a quarter of which are audio recordings.

=== Audio Library ===

One of the purported aims of the Matheson Library is to use existing contemporary media technologies to make available resources from ancient traditions, either in the form of recitation of traditional scriptures or in the scholarly transmission of the doctrines and insights pertaining to the different religions. An ongoing ''hear!'' project is converting scholarly texts and other texts of interest into [[MP3]] format, and making them available through the Audio section of the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themathesontrust.org/type/audio/ |title=Audio |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 the ''Matheson Trust Sacred Audio Collection'' was launched, a repository of selected liturgical audio recordings from the major religious traditions. This collection includes live recordings from temples and ritual gatherings around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/sacred-audio-collection |title=Sacred Audio Collection |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">'''The Tolerance Act''' ({{lang-sv|Toleransediktet}}) was a Swedish law, enacted by [[Gustav III of Sweden]] 24 January 1781. It guaranteed freedom of religion and full citizen rights for all Christian immigrants and residents in Sweden.   

Since the [[Uppsala Synod]] of 1593, Lutheranism had officially been the only religion allowed in Sweden, though the foreign embassies were given dispensation. The Tolerance Act was introduced in line with the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. There were also an economical aspect, as it would make it easier for foreigners to work in Sweden. By the Act, all Christian immigrants were granted full freedom of religion and guaranteed their right to bring up their children in their faith as well. This act was followed in 1782 by the ''[[Judereglementet]]'' (The Jew's Law), which guaranteed the freedom of religion for Jewish immigrants. This Act was a step toward full freedom of religion in Sweden. However, they only applied to immigrants and foreigners, while the Lutheran Swedish citizens were still prohibited their freedom of religion through the ''[[konventikelplakatet]]''. 

The Tolerance Act was replaced by the [[Dissenter Acts (Sweden)]] from the 1850s, which guaranteed freedom of religion to all Swedish citizens. 

The final act was the law of 1951, which allowed for complete freedom of conscience by allowing citizens from leaving their religion without replacing it with another one, thereby formally also allowing atheism.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}

In [[religion]], '''transcendence''' refers to the aspect of a [[deity]]'s nature and power that is wholly independent of the material [[universe]], beyond all known [[physical law]]s. This is contrasted [[immanence]], where a god is said to be fully present in the physical world and thus accessible to creatures in various ways. In [[religious experience]] transcendence is a state of being that has overcome the limitations of physical existence and by some definitions has also become independent of it. This is typically manifested in  [[prayer]], [[séance]], [[meditation]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s and [[paranormal]] "visions".

It is affirmed in various religious traditions' concept of the [[divinity|divine]], which contrasts with the notion of a [[god]] (or, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]) that exists exclusively in the physical order ([[immanence|immanentism]]), or indistinguishable from it ([[pantheism]]). Transcendence can be attributed to the divine not only in its being, but also in its knowledge. Thus, a god may transcend both the universe and knowledge (is beyond the grasp of the human mind).

Although transcendence is defined as the opposite of [[immanence]], the two are not necessarily [[mutually exclusive]]. Some [[theology|theologians]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] of various religious traditions affirm that a god is both within and beyond the universe ([[panentheism]]); in it, but not of it; simultaneously pervading it and surpassing it.

==View by religion==
===Bahá'í Faith===
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] believe in a [[Monotheism|single]], imperishable [[god]], the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1988 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-85229-486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Bahá'í tradition, god is described as "a personal god, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA
 |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-9.html#gr26 | page= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a mind, will and purpose.  Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] or sometimes ''divine educators''.&lt;ref name="eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, nor to create a complete and accurate image.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages =1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism]] "transcendence", by definition, belongs to the mortal beings of the [[Buddhist cosmology#Formless Realm (Ārūpyadhātu)|formless realms]] of existence. However, although such beings are at 'the peak' of [[Samsara]], Buddhism considers the development of transcendence to be both temporary and a spiritual cul-de-sac, which therefore does not eventuate a permanent cessation of Samsara. This assertion was a primary differentiator from the other [[Sramana]] teachers during [[Gautama Buddha]]'s own training and development.&lt;ref&gt;Ariyapariyesana Sutta - "'This Dhamma (of Alara Kalama) leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness (one of the four states of formlessness).'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, in the various forms of Buddhism—Theravada, Mahayana (especially Pure Land and Zen) and Vajrayana—the notion of transcendence sometimes includes a [[soteriological]] application. Except for Pure Land and Vajrayana, the role played by transcendent beings is minimal and at most a temporary expedient. However some Buddhists believe that [[Nirvana]] is an eternal, transcendental state beyond name and form, so for these Buddhists, Nirvana is the main concept of transcendence. The more usual interpretation of Nirvana in Buddhism is that it is a cessation—a permanent absence of something (namely suffering), and therefore it is not in any way a state which could be considered transcendent.

Primordial enlightenment and the dharma are sometimes portrayed as transcendent, since they can surpass all samsaric obstructions.

===Christianity===
{{Attributes of God}}
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
The Catholic Church, as do other Christian Churches, holds that God transcends all creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#35/z Catechism of the Catholic Church §§42, 212]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], "...concerning God, we cannot grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to him."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, Thomas. SCG I, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropomorphic depictions of God are largely metaphorical and reflect the challenge of "human modes of expression" in attempting to describe the infinite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#35/z CCC §43]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] observed "...[I]t is only by the use of such human expressions that Scripture can make its many kinds of readers whom it wants to help to feel, as it were, at home."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 15, 25&lt;/ref&gt; The "sense of transcendence" and therefore, an awareness of the "sacred", is an important component of the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincolndiocese.org/op-ed/bcwriting/102-reflecting-on-transcendence-in-the-liturgy-the-new-translation-of-the-mass-and-what-will-it-mean-for-us Conley, James D., "Reflecting on Transcendence in the Liturgy", ''southern Nebraska Register'']&lt;/ref&gt; God is recognized as both transcendent and [[Immanence|immanent]].

===Hinduism===
Transcendence is described and viewed from a number of diverse perspectives in [[Hinduism]]. Some traditions, such as [[Advaita Vedanta]], view transcendence in the form of God as the [[Nirguna Brahman]] (God without attributes), transcendence being absolute. Other traditions, such as [[Bhakti yoga]], view transcendence as God with attributes ([[Saguna Brahman]]), the Absolute being a personal deity ([[Ishvara]]), such as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]].

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] transcendence is described as a level of spiritual attainment, or state of being which is open to all spiritual aspirants (the goal of [[yoga]] practice), the state at which one is no longer under the control of animalistic, base desires and is aware of a higher spiritual reality.
{{quote|When the [[yogi|yogī]], by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and becomes situated in transcendence — devoid of all material desires — he is said to be well established in yoga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/6/18/en1 BG 6.18] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118000234/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/6/18/en1 |date=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The exact nature of this transcendence is given as being "above the modes of material nature", which are known as ''[[gunas]]'' (ropes) which bind the living entity to the world of ''[[samsara]]'' (repeated rebirth) in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhagavadgitaasitis.com/14/22-25/en1 BG 14.22-25] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303001808/http://www.bhagavadgitaasitis.com/14/22-25/en1 |date=3 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Tawhid|Tanzih}}
''Tawhid'' is the act of believing and affirming that [[God]] (Arabic: [[Allah]]) is one and unique (''wāḥid''). The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the entire creation.&lt;ref name="EncRel"&gt;Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Qur'an:&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Say: He is God, the One and Only;  God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him." (Sura {{cite quran|112|1-4|style=nosup|expand=no}}, ''Yusuf Ali'') &lt;br&gt;Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were God's will, God could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom God will as your successors, even as God raised you up from the posterity of other people." (Sura {{cite quran|6|133|style=nosup|expand=no}}, ''Yusuf Ali'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Vincent J. Cornell, the Qur'an also provides a [[monism|monist]] image of God by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things:"God is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward; God is the Knower of everything (Sura {{cite quran|57|3|style=nosup|expand=no}})"&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt; All Muslims have however vigorously criticized interpretations that would lead to a monist view of God for what they see as blurring the distinction between the creator and the creature, and its incompatibility with the radical monotheism of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Gottlie (2006), p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to explain the complexity of unity of God and of the divine nature, the Qur'an uses 99 terms referred to as "Most Beautiful Names of Allah" (Sura 77:180)[12]. Aside from the supreme name "Allah" and the neologism al-Rahman (referring to the divine beneficence that constantly  (re)creates, maintains and destroys the universe), other names may be shared by both God and human beings. According to the Islamic teachings, the latter is meant to serve as a reminder of God's [[immanence]] rather than being a sign of one's divinity or alternatively imposing a limitation on God's transcendent nature.

Tawhid or Oneness of God constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;D. Gimaret, ''Tawhid'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Qur'an.&lt;ref name="Barlas96"&gt;Asma Barlas (2003-2007) Believing Women in Islam. University of Texas Press, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Ramadan (2005), p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
[[Jewish]] theologians, especially since the [[Middle Ages]], have described the transcendence of God in terms of [[divine simplicity]], explaining the traditional characteristics of God as [[omniscient]] and [[omnipotent]].  Interventions of divine transcendence occur in the form of events outside the realm of natural occurrence such as [[miracle]]s and the [[revelation]] of the [[Ten Commandments]] to [[Moses]] at [[Mt. Sinai]].

In Jewish [[Kabbalistic]] [[cosmology]], God is described as the "[[Ein Sof]]" (literally, without end) as reference to God's divine simplicity and essential unknowability. The emanation of creation from the Ein Sof is explained through a process of filtering. In the Kabbalistic [[creation myth]] referred to as the "breaking of the vessels," filtering was necessary because otherwise this intense, simple essence would have overwhelmed and made impossible the emergence of any distinct creations. Each filter, described as a vessel, captured the emanation of this creative force until it was overwhelmed and broken by the intensity of God's simple essence. Once broken, the vessel's shards, full of absorbed "divine sparks," fell into a vessel below. This process ultimately continued until the "light" of Godliness was sufficiently reduced to allow the world we inhabit to be sustained without breaking. The creation of this world, however, comes with the consequence that Godly transcendence is hidden, or "exiled" (from the immanent world). Only through the revelation of sparks hidden within the shards embedded in our material world can this transcendence be recognized again. In [[Hasidic]] thought, divine sparks are revealed through the performance of commandments or "[[mitzvot]]," (literally, the obligations and prohibitions described in the [[Torah]]). A Kabbalistic explanation for the existence of malevolence in the world is that such terrible things are possible with the divine sparks being hidden. Thus there is some urgency to performing mitzvot in order to liberate the hidden sparks and perform a "[[tikkun olam]]" (literally, healing of the world). Until then, the world is presided over by the immanent aspect of God, often referred to as the [[Shekhinah]] or divine spirit, and in feminine terms.

===Sikhism===
'''[[Waheguru]]''' ({{lang-pa|ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ}}, ''{{IAST|Vāhigurū}}'') is a term most often used in [[Sikhism]] to refer to [[God]], the [[Supreme Being]] or the creator of all. It means "Wonderful Teacher" in the Punjabi language, but in this case is used to refer to the Sikh God. ''Wahi'' means "wonderful" (a Middle Persian borrowing) and "[[Guru]]" ({{lang-sa|गुरु}}) is a term denoting "teacher". Waheguru is also described by some{{According to whom|date=August 2014}} as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions.

Cumulatively, the name implies wonder at the Divine Light eliminating spiritual darkness. It might also imply, "Hail the Lord whose name eliminates spiritual darkness." Earlier, [[Shaheed Bhai Mani Singh]], ''Sikhan di Bhagat Mala'', gave a similar explication, also on the authority of [[Guru Nanak]]. Considering the two constituents of "Vahiguru" ("vahi" + "guru") implying the state of wondrous ecstasy and offering of homage to the Lord, the first one was brought distinctly and prominently into the devotional system by Guru Nanak, who has made use of this interjection, as in [[Majh ki Var]] (stanza 24), and [[Suhi ki Var]], [[sloka meter|sloka]] to [[pauri]] 10.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Sikh doctrine identifies one panentheistic god (Ek Onkar) who is omnipresent and has infinite qualities, whose name is true (Satnam), can do anything (Karta purkh), has no fear (Nirb  hau), is not the enemy of anyone (Nirvair), is beyond time (Akaal), has no image (Murat), is beyond birth and death circulation (Ajunee), is self-existent (Sai Bhang) and possesses the grace of word guru (eternal light) we can meet him (Gurprasaad). Sikhs do not identify a gender for Ek Onkar, nor do they believe it takes a human form. In the Sikh tradition, all human beings are considered equal regardless of their religion, sex, or race. All are sons and daughters of Waheguru, the Almighty.&lt;ref name="Heartbeat"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ek-Onkar-Satnam-Heartbeat-Nanak/dp/1477214267/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384679886&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Ek+Onkar+Satnam%3A+The+Heartbeat+of+Nanak | title=Ek Onkar Satnam: The Heartbeat of Nanak | publisher=AuthorHouseUK | author=Taoshobuddha | date=22 Aug 2012 |page=438 | isbn=1-4772-1426-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "death of God" and the end of transcendence in secular culture==
{{See also|God is dead|Richard L. Rubenstein}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
In 1961, Christian theologian [[Gabriel Vahanian]]'s published ''The Death of God''. Vahanian argued that modern secular culture had lost all sense of the sacred, lacking any sacramental meaning, no transcendental purpose or sense of providence. He concluded that for the modern secular mind "God is dead", but he did not mean that God did not exist. In Vahanian's vision a transformed post-Christian and post-modern culture was needed to create a renewed experience of deity.

Paul Van Buren and William Hamilton both agreed that the concept of transcendence had lost any meaningful place in modern secular thought. According to the norms of contemporary modern secular thought, God is dead. In responding to this denial of transcendence Van Buren and Hamilton offered secular people the option of Jesus as the model human who acted in love. The encounter with the Christ of faith would be open in a church-community.

[[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] offered a radical theology of the death of God that drew upon [[William Blake]], Hegelian thought and Nietzschean ideas. He conceived of theology as a form of poetry in which the immanence (presence) of God could be encountered in faith communities. However, he no longer accepted the possibility of affirming his belief in a transcendent God. Altizer concluded that God had incarnated in Christ and imparted his immanent spirit which remained in the world even though Jesus was dead. It is important that such ideas are understood as socio-cultural developments and not as ontological realities. As Vahanian expressed it in his book, the issue of the denial of God lies in the mind of secular man, not in reality.

Critiquing the death of God theology, Joseph Papin, the founder of the Villanova Theology Institute, noted: "Rumbles of the new theology of the 'Requiem for God," (theologians of the death of God) proved to be a totally inadequate foundation for spanning a theological river with a bridge.  The school of the theology of the "Requiem of God," not even implementing a "Requiem for Satan," will constitute only a footnote to the history of theology. . . . 'The Grave of God,' was the death rattle for the continuancy of the aforementioned school without any noticeable echo." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Post-Conciliar Perspectives," The Dynamic in Christian Thought|last=Papin|first=Joseph|publisher=Villanova University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Piet Schoonenberg (Nijmegen, Netherlands) directly critiqued Altizer concluding: "Rightly understood the transcendence of God does not exclude His immanence, but includes it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="The Transcendence of God, Part I," Transcendence and Immanence, Reconstruction in the Light of Process Thinking, Festschrift in Honor of Joseph Papin, ed. Joseph Armenti|last=Schoonenberg|first=Piet|publisher=Abbey Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schoonenberg went on to say: "We must take God's transcendence seriously by not imposing any limits whatsoever, not even the limits that our images or concepts of transcendence evoke. This however occurs when God's transcendence is expressed as elevated over the world to the exclusion of his presence in this world; when his independence is expressed by excluding his real relation and reaction to the world; or when we insist upon his unchangeable eternity to the exclusion of his real partnership in human history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="From Transcendence to Immanence, Part II," Wisdom and Knowledge, Essays in Honor of Joseph Papin, ed.

Radtke, ''Drei Schriften des Theosophen von Tirmid̲'', ii (Beirut-Stuttgart, 1996), pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; and particular verses of the [[Quran]] and certain [[hadith]] were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as "documentary evidence"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; of the existence of saints. Graves of saints around the Muslim world became centers of pilgrimage — especially after 1200 CE — for masses of Muslims seeking their ''[[barakah]]'' (blessing).&lt;ref name=brown-59/&gt;

Since the first Muslim hagiographies were written during the period when the Islamic mystical trend of [[Sufism]] began its rapid expansion, many of the figures who later came to be regarded as the major saints in orthodox [[Sunni Islam]] were the early Sufi mystics, like [[Hasan of Basra]] (d. 728), [[Farqad Sabakhi]] (d. 729), [[Dawud Tai]] (d. 777–781), [[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] (d. 801), [[Maruf Karkhi]] (d. 815), and [[Junayd of Baghdad]] (d. 910).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, "the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of [[Sufism]] ... into orders or brotherhoods".&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"&gt;Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam: Language and Meaning'' (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2009), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In the common expressions of Islamic piety of this  period, the saint was understood to be "a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples".&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; In many prominent Sunni Islamic [[creed]]s of the time, such as the famous ''[[Al-Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah|Creed of Tahawi]]'' (c. 900) and the ''[[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi|Creed of Nasafi]]'' (c. 1000), a belief in the existence and miracles of saints was presented as "a requirement" for being an orthodox Muslim believer.&lt;ref name="Jonathan A.C. Brown 2012 p. 123"&gt;Jonathan A. C. Brown, "Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints", ''Journal of Sufi Studies'' 1 (2012), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor 1999 pp. 5-6"&gt;Christopher Taylor, ''In the Vicinity of the Righteous'' (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the Sufis, the preeminent saints in traditional Islamic piety are the [[sahaba|Companions]] of [[Muhammad]], their [[tabiun|Successors]], and the [[Taba Tabe'een|third generation after the Prophet, often called "the Successors of the Successors"]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''What is Sufism?'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), pp. 36–37, 45, 102, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[prophets of Islam]] are also believed to be saints by definition, although they are rarely referred to as such, in order to prevent confusion between them and ordinary saints; as the prophets are exalted by Muslims as the greatest of all humanity, it is a general tenet of Sunni belief that a single prophet is greater than all the regular saints put together.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;See Al-Ṭaḥāwī, ''Al-ʿAqīdah aṭ-Ṭaḥāwiyya'' XCVIII-IX&lt;/ref&gt; In short, it is believed that "every prophet is a saint, but not every saint is a prophet".&lt;ref&gt;Reza Shah-Kazemi, "The Metaphysics of Interfaith Dialogue", in ''Paths to the Heart: Sufism and the Christian East'', ed. James Cutsinger (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2002), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, the traditional Sunni and Shia idea of saints has been challenged by movements such as [[Salafism]], [[Wahhabism]], and [[Islamic modernism]], all three of which have, to a greater or lesser degree, "formed a front against the  veneration and theory of saints."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements has indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to resist "acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations".&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor pp. 5-6"&gt;Christopher Taylor, In the Vicinity of the Righteous (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the presence of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital role in daily expressions of piety among vast segments of Muslim populations in Muslim countries like [[Pakistan]], [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Senegal]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Morocco]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Regarding the rendering of the Arabic ''walī'' by the English "saint", prominent scholars such as [[Gibril Haddad]] have regarded this as an appropriate translation, with Haddad describing the aversion of some Muslims towards the use of "saint" for ''walī'' as "a specious objection ... for [this is] – like 'Religion' (''din''), 'Believer' (''mu'min''), 'prayer' (''salat''), etc. – [a] generic term for holiness and holy persons while there is no confusion, for Muslims, over their specific referents in Islam, namely: the reality of ''iman'' with Godwariness and those who possess those qualities."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/ShaykhGibrilFouadHaddad/photos/a.657828704229541.1073741828.585959144749831/1247518531927219/?type=3&amp;comment_id=1248075658538173&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R0%22%7D]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Persian language|Persian]], which became the second most influential and widely-spoken language in the Islamic world after [[Arabic]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  the general title for a saint or a spiritual master became ''pīr'' ({{lang-fa|پیر}}, literally "old [person]", "elder"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newby|first1=Gordon|title=A Concise Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2002|publisher=One World|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85168-295-3|page=173|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although the ramifications of this phrase include the connotations of a general "saint,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  it is often used to specifically signify a spiritual guide of some type.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Amongst [[Indian Muslims]], the title ''peer baba'' (पीर बाबा) is commonly used in [[Hindustani language|Hindi]] to refer to Sufi masters or similarly honored saints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, saints are also sometimes referred to in the Persian or [[Urdu]] vernacular with "[[Hazrat]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In [[Sufism|Islamic mysticism]], a ''pīr's'' role is to guide and instruct his disciples on the mystical path.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Hence, the key difference between the use of ''walī'' and ''pīr'' is that the former does not imply a saint who is also a spiritual master with disciples, whilst the latter directly does so through its connotations of "elder."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, other Arabic and Persian words that also often have the same connotations as ''pīr'', and hence are also sometimes translated into English as "saint", include ''[[murshid]]'' ({{lang-ar|مرشد}}, meaning "guide" or "teacher"), ''[[sheikh#Sufi term|sheikh]]'' and ''sarkar'' (Persian word meaning "master").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the Turkish Islamic lands, saints have been referred to by many terms, including the Arabic ''walī'', the Persian ''s̲h̲āh'' and ''pīr'',  and Turkish alternatives like ''baba'' in Anatolia, ''ata'' in [[Central Asia]] (both meaning "father"), as well as ''eren'' or ''ermis̲h̲'' (&lt; ermek "to reach, attain") or ''yati̊r'' ("one who settles down") in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Their tombs, meanwhile, are "denoted by terms of Arabic or Persian origin alluding to the idea of pilgrimage (''mazār'', ''ziyāratgāh''), tomb (''ḳabr'', ''maḳbar'') or domed mausoleum (''gunbad'', ''ḳubba''). But such tombs are also denoted by terms usually used for dervish convents, or a particular part of it (''tekke'' in the [[Balkans]], ''langar'', 'refectory,' and ''ribāṭ'' in [[Central Asia]]), or by a quality of the saint (''pīr'', 'venerable, respectable,' in [[Azerbaijan]])."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jahangir with sufi.jpg|thumb|upright=1| A [[Mughal miniature]] dated from the early 1620s depicting the [[Mughal emperor]] [[Jahangir]] (d. 1627) preferring a Sufi [[saint]] to his contemporary, the [[King of England]] [[James I]] (d. 1625); the picture is inscribed: "Though outwardly kings stand before him, he fixes his gazes on saints."]]

According to various traditional Sufi interpretations of the Quran, the concept of sainthood is clearly described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=64U41q5MgLYC|title=Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition|author=Muhammad Hisham Kabbani|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars, however, assert that the [[Quran]] does not ''explicitly'' outline a doctrine or theory of saints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the Quran, the adjective ''walī'' is applied to [[God]], in the sense of Him being the "friend" of all believers (2:257). However, particular Quranic verses were interpreted by early Islamic scholars to refer to a special, exalted group of holy people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; These included 10:62:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; "Surely God's friends (''awliyāa l-lahi''): no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and 5:54, which refers to God's love for those who love Him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Additionally, some scholars&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; interpreted 4:69, "Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger, they are with those unto whom God hath shown favor: the prophets and the ''ṣidīqīna'' and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they," to carry a reference to holy people who were not prophets and were ranked below the latter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The word ''ṣidīqīna'' in this verse literally connotes "the truthful ones" or "the just ones," and was often interpreted by the early Islamic thinkers in the sense of "saints," with the famous Quran translator [[Marmaduke Pickthall]] rendering it as "saints" in their interpretations of the scripture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, the Quran referred to the miracles of saintly people who were not prophets like [[Khidr]] (18:65-82) and the [[People of the Cave]] (18:7-26), which also led many early scholars to deduce that a group of venerable people must exist who occupy a rank below the prophets but are nevertheless exalted by God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The references in the corpus of [[hadith|hadith literature]] to ''bona fide'' saints like the pre-Islamic Jurayj̲,&lt;ref&gt;Buk̲h̲ārī. ''Saḥīḥ al-ʿamal fi ’l-ṣalāt'', Bāb 7, ''Maẓālim'', Bāb 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslim (Cairo 1283), v, 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maḳdisī, ''al-Badʾ wa ’l-taʾrīk̲h̲'', ed. Huart, Ar. text 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samarḳandī, ''Tanbīh'', ed. Cairo 1309, 221&lt;/ref&gt; only lent further credence to this early understanding of saints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Collected stories about the "lives or ''vitae'' of the saints", began to be compiled "and transmitted at an early stage"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; by many regular Muslim scholars, including [[Ibn Abi al-Dunya]] (d. 894),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; who wrote a work entitled ''Kitāb al-Awliyāʾ'' (''Lives of the Saints'') in the ninth-century, which constitutes "the earliest [complete] compilation on the theme of God's friends."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Prior to Ibn Abi al-Dunya's work, the stories of the saints were transmitted through [[oral tradition]]; but after the composition of his work, many Islamic scholars began writing down the widely circulated accounts,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; with later scholars like Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī (d. 948) making extensive use of Ibn Abi al-Dunya's work in his own ''Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ'' (''The Adornment of the Saints'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is, moreover, evident from the ''Kitāb al-Kas̲h̲f wa ’l-bayān'' of the early [[Baghdad]]i [[Sufi]] [[mysticism|mystic]] [[Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz]] (d. 899) that a cohesive understanding of the Muslim saints was already in existence, with al-Kharraz spending ample space distinguishing between the virtues and miracles (''karāmāt'') of the [[prophet]]s and the [[saint]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The genre of [[hagiography]] (''[[manāḳib]]'') only became more popular with the passage of time, with numerous prominent Islamic thinkers of the [[medieval period]] devoting large works to collecting stories of ''various'' saints or to focusing upon "the marvelous aspects of the life, the miracles or at least the prodigies of a [specific] Ṣūfī or of a saint believed to have been endowed with miraculous powers."&lt;ref&gt;Pellat, Ch., "Manāḳib", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late ninth-century, important thinkers in [[Sunni Islam]] officially articulated the previously-oral doctrine of an entire hierarchy of saints, with the first written account of this hierarchy coming from the pen of [[al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi]] (d. 907-912).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; With the [[ijma|general consensus]] of Islamic scholars of the period accepting that the [[ulema]] were responsible for maintaining the "exoteric" part of Islamic orthodoxy, including the disciplines of [[shariah|law]] and [[fiqh|jurisprudence]], while the Sufis were responsible for articulating the religion's deepest inward truths,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; later prominent mystics like [[Ibn Arabi]] (d. 1240) only further reinforced this idea of a saintly hierarchy, and the notion of "types" of saints became a mainstay of Sunni mystical thought, with such types including the ''ṣiddīqūn'' ("the truthful ones") and the ''abdāl'' ("the substitute-saints"), amongst others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It should be noted, however, that many of these concepts appear in writing far before al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Arabi; the idea of the ''abdāl'', for example, appears as early as the ''[[Ancient South Arabian script|Musnad]]'' of [[Ibn Hanbal]] (d. 855), where the word signifies a group of major saints "whose number would remain constant, one always being replaced by some other on his death."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Melchert, The Ḥanābila and the Early Sufis, Arabica, T. 48, Fasc. 3 (Brill, 2001), p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; It is, in fact, reported that Ibn Hanbal explicitly identified his contemporary, the mystic [[Maruf Karkhi]] (d. 815-20), as one of the ''[[abdal]]'', saying: "He is one of the substitute-saints, and his supplication is answered."&lt;ref&gt;Gibril F. Haddad, ''The Four Imams and Their Schools'' (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, "the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of [[Sufism]]—the mysticism of Islam—into orders or brotherhoods."&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; In general Islamic piety of the period, the saint was understood to be "a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples."&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; It was by virtue of his spiritual wisdom that the saint was accorded veneration in medieval Islam, "and it is this which ... [effected] his 'canonization,' and not some ecclesiastical institution" as in [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; In fact, the latter point represents one of the crucial differences between the Islamic and Christian veneration of saints, for saints are venerated by unanimous consensus or popular acclaim in Islam, in a manner akin to all those Christian saints who began to be venerated prior to the institution of [[canonization]].&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; In fact, a belief in the existence of saints became such an important part of medieval Islam&lt;ref name="Jonathan A.C. Brown 2012 p. 123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor 1999 pp. 5-6"/&gt;  that many of the most important [[creed]]s articulated during the time period, like the famous ''[[Al-Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah|Creed of Tahawi]]'', explicitly declared it a requirement for being an "orthodox" Muslim to believe in the existence and veneration of [[saint#Islam|saints]] and in the traditional narratives of their lives and miracles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonathan A.C. Brown 2012 p. 123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor 1999 pp. 5-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Renard 2008"/&gt; Hence, we find that even medieval critics of the widespread practice of [[ziyara|venerating ''the tombs'' of saints]], like [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (d. 1328), never denied the existence of saints as such, with the [[Hanbali]] [[jurist]] stating: "The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''al-Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'', 1980, p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of one contemporary academic, practically all Muslims of that era believed that "the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable."&lt;ref&gt;Josef W. Meri, ''The Cult of Saints among Muslims and Jews in Medieval Syria'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, the idea of saints has been challenged by the movements of [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], whose influence has "formed a front against the veneration and theory of saints."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For the adherents of [[Wahhabism]], for example, the practice of venerating saints appears as an "abomination", for they see in this a form of [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is for this reason that the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], which adheres to the Wahhabi creed, "destroyed the tombs of saints wherever ... able"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; during its expansion in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] from the eighteenth-century onwards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements have indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to also resist "acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations."&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor pp. 5-6"/&gt; At the same time, the movement of [[Islamic Modernism]] has also opposed the traditional veneration of saints, for many proponents of this ideology regard the practice as "being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium."&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'' (New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009), p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the presence, however, of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital part in the daily piety of vast portions of Muslim countries like Pakistan, [[Egypt]], Turkey, [[Senegal]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Morocco]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:Dara Shikoh and Mian Mir.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5| Detail from an Indian [[miniature art|miniature]] depicting the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[prince]] [[Dara Shikoh]] (d. 1659) seeking the advice of a local saint named [[Mian Mir]] (d. 1635), undated but perhaps from the late seventeenth-century]]
The general definition of the Muslim saint in classical texts is that he represents a "[friend of God] marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness",  being specifically "chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work [[miracle worker|miracles]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Moreover, the saint is also portrayed in traditional hagiographies as one who "in some way ... acquires his Friend's, i.e. God's, good qualities, and therefore he possesses particular authority, forces, capacities and abilities."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Amongst classical scholars, [[Qushayri]] (d. 1073) defined the saint as someone "whose obedience attains permanence without interference of sin; whom God preserves and guards, in permanent fashion, from the failures of sin through the power of acts of obedience."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn `Abidin, ''Rasa'il'', 2:277&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, the same author quoted an older tradition in order to convey his understanding of the purpose of saints, which states: "The saints of God are those who, when they are seen, God is remembered."&lt;ref&gt;Abū’l-Qāsim al-Qushayrī, ''Laṭā'if al-Isharat bi-Tafsīr al-Qur'ān'', tr. Zahra Sands (Louisville: Fons Vitae; Amaan: Royal Aal-al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought, 2015), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi]] (d. 869), the most significant ninth-century expositor of the doctrine,  posited six common attributes of true saints (not necessarily applicable to all, according to the author, but nevertheless indicative of a significant portion of them), which are: (1) when people see him, they are automatically reminded of God; (2) anyone who advances towards him in a hostile way is destroyed; (3) he possesses the gift of clairvoyance (''firāsa''); (4) he receives divine inspiration (''ilhām''), to be strictly distinguished from revelation proper (''waḥy''),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''Return to the Spirit'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''Mecca: From Before Genesis Until Now'' (London: Archetype, 2004), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter being something only the [[prophet]]s receive; (5) he can work miracles (''karāmāt'') by the leave of [[God]], which may differ from saint to saint, but may include marvels such as walking on water (''al-mas̲h̲y ʿalā ’l-māʾ'') and shortening [[space and time]] (''ṭayy al-arḍ''); and (6) he associates with [[Khidr]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Radtke and J. O’Kane, ''The Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism'' (London, 1996), pp. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Al-Tirmidhi states, furthermore, that although the saint is not sinless like the prophets, he or she can nevertheless be "preserved from sin" (''maḥfūz'') by the grace of God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The contemporary scholar of Sufism [[Martin Lings]] described the Islamic saints as "the great incarnations of the Islamic ideal.... spiritual giants with which almost every generation was blessed."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, "Proofs of Islam", ''Ilm Magazine'', Volume 10, Number 1, December 1985, pp. 3-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical testimonies===
{{Main article|Miracles of the Saints (Islam)}}
The doctrine of saints, and of their miracles, seems to have been taken for granted by many of the major authors of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (ca. 700-1400),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as well as by many prominent late-medieval scholars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The phenomena in traditional Islam can be at least partly ascribed to the writings of many of the most prominent Sunni theologians and doctors of the classical and medieval periods,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; many of whom considered the belief in saints to be "orthodox" doctrine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Examples of classical testimonies include:

* "God has saints (''awliyā'') whom He has specially distinguished by His friendship and whom He has chosen to be the governors of His kingdom… He has made the saints governors of the universe… Through the blessing of their advent the rain falls from heaven, and through the purity of their lives the plants spring up from the earth, and through their spiritual influence the Muslims gain victories over the truth concealers" ([[Hujwiri]] [d. 1072-7]; [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] jurist and mystic)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* "The miracles of the saints (''awliyā'') are a reality. The miracle appears on behalf of the saint by way of contradicting the customary way of things.... And such a thing is reckoned as an evidentiary miracle on behalf of the Messenger to one of whose people this act appears, because it is evident from it that he is a saint, and he could never be a saint unless he were right in his religion; and his religion is the confession of the message of the Messenger" ([[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi|al-Nasafī]] [d. 1142], ''Creed'' XV; [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] theologian)&lt;ref&gt;Earl Edgar Elder (ed. and trans.), ''A Commentary on the Creed of Islam'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1950), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The Qur’an has pointed to it in different places, and the Hadith of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators" ([[Ibn Taymiyya]] [d. 1328], ''Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya''; [[Sunni]] [[Hanbali]] theologian and jurisconsult)&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'' (al-Madani Publishing House, 1980), p. 603&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for veneration of deceased saints by pilgrims in an appeal for blessings (''[[Barakah]]'') even though the saints will not rise from the dead until the Day of Resurrection (''[[Yawmuddin|Yawm ad-Dīn]]'')  may come from the hadith that states “the Prophets are alive in their graves and they pray”.&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by al-Bazzaar; classed as authentic by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2790, according to {{cite web |last1=Saalih al-Munajjid |first1=Muhammad |title=26117: The Lives of the Prophets |url=https://islamqa.info/en/26117 |website=Islam Question and Answer |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (According to the Islamic concept of  [[Punishment of the Grave]] -- established by [[hadith]] -- the dead are still conscious and active, with the wicked suffering in their graves as a prelude to hell and the pious at ease.) According to Islamic historian Jonathan A.C. Brown, "saints are thought to be no different" than prophets, "as able in death to answer invocations for assistance" as they were while alive.&lt;ref name=brown-59&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

==Types and hierarchy==
[[File:The Poets Hafiz and Saadi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|A drawing of ''The Two Poet Saints [[Hafez]] and [[Saadi Shirazi]]'' (ca. 17th century), thought to be executed by a certain Muhammad Qāsim]]
Saints were envisaged to be of different "types" in classical Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Aside from their earthly differences as regard their temporal duty (i.e. [[jurist]], [[hadith]] [[scholar]], [[judge]], [[traditionist]], [[historian]], [[ascetic]], poet), saints were also distinguished cosmologically as regards their celestial function or standing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Islam, however, the saints are represented in traditional texts as serving separate celestial functions, in a manner similar  to the [[angel]]s, and this is closely linked to the idea of a celestial hierarchy in which the various types of saints play different roles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A fundamental distinction was described in the ninth-century by al-Tirmidhi in his ''Sīrat al-awliyāʾ'' (''Lives of the Saints''), who distinguished between two principal varieties of saints: the ''walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh'', on the one hand, and the ''walī Allāh'' on the other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to the author, "the [spiritual] ascent of the ''walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh'' must stop at the end of the [[Creation myth|created]] [[cosmos]] ... he can attain God's proximity, but not God Himself; he is only admitted to God's proximity (''muḳarrab''). It is the ''walī Allāh'' who reaches God. Ascent beyond God's throne means to traverse consciously the realms of light of the [[Names of God in Islam|Divine Names]].... When the ''walī Allāh'' has traversed all the realms of the Divine Names, i.e. has come to know God in His names as completely as possible, he is then extinguished in God's essence. His soul, his ego, is eliminated and ... when he acts, it is God Who acts through him. And so the state of extinction means at the same time the highest degree of activity in this world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Although the doctrine of the hierarchy of saints is already found in written sources as early as the eighth-century,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; it was al-Tirmidhi who gave it its first systematic articulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
According to the author, forty major saints, whom he refers to by the various names of ''ṣiddīḳīn'', ''abdāl'', ''umanāʾ'', and ''nuṣaḥāʾ'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; were appointed after the death of [[Muhammad]] to perpetuate the knowledge of the divine mysteries vouchsafed to them by the prophet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These forty saints, al-Tirmidhi stated, would be replaced in each generation after their earthly death; and, according to him, "the fact that they exist is a guarantee for the continuing existence of the world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Among these forty, al-Tirmidhi specified that seven of them were especially blessed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Despite their exalted nature, however, al-Tirmidhi emphasized that these forty saints occupied a rank below the prophets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Later important works which detailed the hierarchy of saints were composed by the mystic ʿAmmār al-Bidlīsī (d. between 1194 and 1207), the spiritual teacher of [[Najmuddin Kubra]] (d. 1220), and by [[Ruzbihan Baqli]] (d. 1209), who evidently knew of "a highly developed hierarchy of God's friends."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The differences in terminology between the various celestial hierarchies presented by these authors were reconciled by later scholars through their belief that the earlier mystics had highlighted particular parts and different aspects of a single, cohesive hierarchy of saints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Regional veneration==
The amount of veneration a specific saint received varied from region to region in Islamic civilization, often on the basis of the saint's own history in that region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While the veneration of saints played a crucial role in the daily piety of [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s all over the Islamic world for more than a thousand years (ca. 800-1800), exactly ''which'' saints were most widely venerated in any given cultural climate depended on the hagiographic traditions of that particular area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Thus, while [[Moinuddin Chishti]] (d. 1236), for example, was honored throughout the Sunni world in the medieval period, his ''cultus'' was especially prominent in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], as that is where he was believed to have preached, performed the majority of his miracles, and ultimately settled at the end of his life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===North Africa===
As has been remarked by scholars, the veneration of saints has played "an essential role in the religious, and social life of the [[Maghreb]] for more or less a millennium,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; in other words since Islam first reached the lands of North Africa in the eighth-century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first ''written'' references to ascetic Muslim saints in Africa, "popularly admired and with followings,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; appear in tenth-century hagiographies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Idris (ed.), ''Manâqib d'Abû Ishâq al-Jabnyânî et de Muhriz b. Khalaf'', Paris 1959&lt;/ref&gt; As has been noted by scholars, however, "the phenomenon may well be older,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; for many of the stories of the Islamic saints were passed down orally before finally being put to writing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  One of the most widely venerated saints in early North African Islamic history was Abū Yaʿzā (or Yaʿazzā, d. 1177), an illiterate [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] [[miracle worker]] whose reputation for sanctity was admired even in his own life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Lobignac, "Un saint berbère, Moulay Ben Azza", in ''Hésperis'', xxxi [1944]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Dermenghem, ''Le culte des saints dans l'Islam maghrébin'', Paris 1954, 1982 [second edition])&lt;/ref&gt; Another immensely popular saint of the time-period was Ibn Ḥirzihim (d. 1163), who also gained renown for his personal devoutness and his ability to work miracles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was [[Abu Madyan]] (d. 1197), however, who eventually became one of the ''Awliya Allah'' of the entire [[Maghreb]]. A "spiritual disciple of these two preceding saints,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Abū Madyan, a prominent Sunni Maliki scholar, was the first figure in Maghrebi Sufism "to exercise an influence beyond his own region."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Abū Madyan travelled to the East, where he is said to have met prominent mystics like the renowned [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] (d. 1166).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Upon returning to the Maghreb, Abū Madyan stopped at [[Béjaïa]] and "formed a circle of disciples."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Abū Madyan eventually died in [[Tlemcen]], while making his way to the [[Almohad]] [[court]] of [[Marrakesh]]; he was later venerated as a prime ''Awliya Allah'' of Tlemcen by popular acclaim.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bel, "Sidi Bou Medyan et son maître Ed-Daqqâq à Fès", in ''Mélanges René Basset'', Paris 1923, i, 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Addas, "Abū Madyan and Ibn ʿArabī", in ''Muhyiddin Ibn ʿArabi: A Commemorative Volume'', Shaftesbury 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Abū Madyan's most notable disciples was [[Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish al-Alami|ʿAbd al-Salām Ibn Mas̲h̲īs̲h̲]] (d. 1127),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; a "saint ... [who] had a posthumous fame through his being recognised as a master and a 'pole' by" [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī]] (d. 1258).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was this last figure who became ''the'' preeminent saint in Maghrebi piety, due to his being the founder of one of the most famous Sunni Sufi orders of North Africa: the [[Shadhiliyya]] [[tariqa]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Adhering to the [[Maliki]] [[rite]] in its [[jurisprudence]], the Shadhili order produced numerous widely honored Sunni saints in the intervening years, including [[Ahmad Zarruq|Fāsī Aḥmad al-Zarrūq]] (d. 1494),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; who was educated in [[Egypt]] but taught in [[Libya]] and [[Morocco]], and [[Muhammad al-Jazuli|Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Jazūlī]] (d. 1465), "who returned to Morocco after a long trip to the East and then began a life as a hermit,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  and who achieved widespread renown for the miracles he is said to have wrought by the leave of God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Eventually, the latter was buried in [[Marrakesh]], where he ended up becoming of the city's seven most famous ''Awliya Allah'' for the Sunnis of the area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some of the most popular and influential Maghrebi saints and mystics of the following centuries were [[Mohammed ibn Nasir|Muḥammad b. Nāṣir]] (d. 1674), [[Ahmad al-Tijani|Aḥmad al-Tij̲ānī]] (d. 1815), [[Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi|Abū Ḥāmid al-ʿArabī al-Darqāwī]] (d. 1823), and [[Ahmad al-Alawi|Aḥmad b. ʿAlāwī]] (d. 1934),&lt;ref&gt;M. Lings, ''A Moslem saint of the twentieth century, Shaikh Ahmad al-ʿAlawī'', London 1961, Fr. tr. ''Un saint musulman du 20 e siècle, le cheikh Ahmad al-ʿAlawī'', Paris 1984&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter three originating Sufi orders of their own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Famous adherents of the Shadhili order amongst modern Islamic scholars include [[Abdallah Bin Bayyah]] (b. 1935), [[Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki]] (d. 2004), [[Hamza Yusuf]] (b. 1958), and [[Muhammad al-Yaqoubi]] (b. 1963).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The veneration of saints in Maghrebi Sunni Islam has been studied by scholars with regard to the various "types" of saints venerated by Sunnis in those areas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These include:

* (1) the "pure, ascetic hermit,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  who is honored for having refused all ostentation, and is commemorated not on account of his written works but by virtue of the reputation he is believed to have had for personal sanctity, miracles, and "inward wisdom or gnosis";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
* (2) "the ecstatic and eccentric saint" (''mad̲j̲d̲h̲ūb''),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; who is believed to have maintained orthodoxy in his fulfillment of the pillars of the faith, but who is famous for having taught in an unusually direct style or for having divulged the highest truths before the majority in a manner akin to [[Hallaj]] (d. 922).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Famous and widely venerated saints of this "type" include Ibn al-Marʾa (d. 1214), ʿAlī al-Ṣanhāj̲ī (ca. 16th-century), ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Mad̲j̲d̲h̲ūb (literally "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān the Ecstatic", d. 1569);&lt;ref&gt;A.L. de Premare, ''Sîdî ʿAbder-Rahmân al-Medjdûb'', Paris-Rabat 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
* (3) the "warrior saint" (pl. ''murābiṭūn'') or martyr;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (4) female saints, who may belong to one of the aforementioned three categories or some other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It has been remarked that "Maghrebi sainthood is by no means confined to men, and ... some of the tombs of female saints are very frequently visited."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (5) "Jewish saints", that is to say, venerable Jewish personages whose tombs are frequented by Sunni Muslims in the area for the seeking of blessings&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Regarding the veneration of saints amongst Sunni Muslims in the Maghreb in the present day, scholars have noted the presence of many "thousands of minor, local saints whose tombs remain visible in villages or the quarters of towns."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although many of these saints lack precise historiographies or hagiographies, "their presence and their social efficacity ... [are] immense"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  in shaping the spiritual life of Muslims in the region. For the vast majority of Muslims in the Maghreb even today, the saints remain "very much alive at their tomb, to the point that the person's name most often serves to denote the place."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  While this classical type of Sunni veneration represents the most widespread stance in the area, the modern influence of [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]] have challenged the traditional practice in some quarters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Turkey, the Balkans, the Caucasus and Azerbaijan===
Scholars have noted the tremendously "important role"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the veneration of saints has historically played in Islamic life all these areas, especially amongst Sunnis who frequent the many thousands of tombs scattered throughout the region for blessings in performing the act of ''ziyāra''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to scholars, "between the Turks of the Balkans and Anatolia, and those in Central Asia, despite the distance separating them, the concept of the saint and the organisation of pilgrimages displays no fundamental differences."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The veneration of saints really spread in the Turkish lands from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and played a crucial role in medieval Turkic Sunni piety not only in cosmopolitan cities but also "in rural areas and amongst nomads of the whole Turkish world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the reasons proposed by scholars for the popularity of saints in pre-modern Turkey is that Islam was majorly spread by the early Sunni Sufis in the Turkish lands, rather than by purely exoteric teachers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Most of the saints venerated in Turkey belonged to the [[Hanafi]] school of Sunni jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As scholars have noted, saints venerated in traditional Turkish Sunni Islam may be classified into three principal categories:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (1) The ''g̲h̲āzīs'' or early Muslims saints who preached the faith in the region and were often martyred for their religion. Some of the most famous and widely venerated saints of this category include the [[prophet]] [[Muhammad]]'s companion [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari|Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī]] (d. 674), who was killed beneath the walls of [[Constantinople]] and was honored as a martyr shortly thereafter,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and Sayyid Baṭṭāl G̲h̲āzī (d. 9th-century), who fought the Christians in [[Anatolia]] during the [[Umayyad]] period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (2) Sufi saints, who were most often Sunni mystics who belonged to the [[Hanafi]] school of Sunni jurisprudence and were attached to one of the orthodox Sufi orders like the [[Naqshbandi]] or the [[Mevlevi]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (3) The "greats figures of Islam", both pre-Islamic and those who came after [[Muhammad]], as well as certain sainted rulers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Reverence of Awliya Allah==
Reverence for Awliya Allah have been an important part of both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] Islamic tradition that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages.&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, pp. 119-120"&gt;Martin Lings, ''What is Sufism?'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), pp. 119-120 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the sheer omnipresence of this belief, the late Martin Lings wrote: "There is scarcely a region in the empire of Islam which has not a Sufi for its Patron Saint."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''What is Sufism?'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; As the veneration accorded saints often develops purely organically in Islamic climates, the ''Awliya Allah'' are often recognized through popular acclaim rather than through official declaration.&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, pp. 119-120"/&gt; Traditionally, it has been understood that the ''Wali'Allah'' of a particular place prays for that place's wellbeing and for the health and happiness of all who live therein.&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, pp. 119-120"/&gt; Here is a partial list of Muslim ''Awliya Allah'':
[[File:Nizamuddin Dargah and Jamaat Khana Masjid, Delhi.jpg|thumb|upright|The shrine of [[Nizamuddin Auliya|Niẓām al-Dīn Awliyā]] (d. 1325) in [[Delhi]], India, where he is honored as an ''Awliya Allah'' of the city; the shrine is the most popular site of Muslim pilgrimage in the [[Indian Subcontinent]]]]

[[File:Baldung Hexen 1508 kol.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|''Witches'' by [[Hans Baldung]]. Woodcut, 1508]]
'''Witchcraft''' or '''witchery''' broadly means the practice of and belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. ''Witchcraft'' is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision,&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=witchcraft+definition&amp;ots=aw4oz13kOS&amp;sig=2CWBjLB2TIsUt1aNz_nyUPxOf5E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=witchcraft%20definition&amp;f=false Witchcraft in the Middle Ages], Jeffrey Russell, p.4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cross-cultural]] assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious [[divination|divinatory]] or medicinal role,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is often present within societies and groups whose [[cultural framework]] includes a magical [[world view]].&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Magic Circle (Waterhouse painting)|The Magic Circle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886]]

The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both "primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001, p xiii: ''"Magic is central not only in 'primitive' societies but in 'high cultural' societies as well"''&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Scientifically, the existence of magical powers and witchcraft are generally believed to [[pseudoscience|lack credence]] and to be unsupported by high-quality [[scientific method|experimental testing]], although individual witchcraft practices [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|and effects]] may be open to [[scientific knowledge|scientific explanation]] or explained via [[mentalism]] and [[Psychological theories of magic|psychology]].

Historically, the [[Christian views on magic|predominant concept of witchcraft in the Western world]] derives from [[Old Testament]] [[biblical law|laws]] against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the [[Early Modern Period]]. It posits a [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] [[conflict between good and evil]], where witchcraft was generally [[evil]] and often associated with [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]] and [[Devil worship]]. This culminated in deaths, [[torture]] and [[scapegoating]] (casting blame for human misfortune),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Burton Russell |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft |title=Witchcraft – Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and many years of large scale [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch-trials]] and [[witch-hunting|witch hunts]], especially in [[Protestant]] Europe, before largely ceasing during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christian views in the modern day are diverse and cover the gamut of views from intense belief and opposition (especially from Christian [[fundamentalist]]s) to non-belief, and in some churches even approval. From the mid-20th century, witchcraft – sometimes called contemporary witchcraft to clearly distinguish it from older beliefs – became the name of a branch of [[modern paganism]].  It is most notably practiced in the [[Wiccan]] and modern witchcraft traditions, and no longer practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press. pp. 45–47, 84–5, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western mainstream Christian view is far from the only societal perspective about witchcraft. Many cultures worldwide continue to have widespread practices and cultural beliefs that are loosely translated into English as "witchcraft", although the English translation masks a very great diversity in their forms, magical beliefs, practices, and place in their societies. During the [[History of colonialism|Age of Colonialism]], many cultures across the globe were exposed to the modern Western world via [[colonialism]], usually accompanied and often preceded by intensive [[Christianity and colonialism|Christian missionary activity]] ''(see "[[Christianization#Colonial era (16th−19th centuries)|Christianization]]")''. Beliefs related to witchcraft and magic in these cultures were at times influenced by the prevailing Western concepts. Witch hunts, scapegoating, and killing or shunning of suspected witches still occurs in the modern era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pearlman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/papuanewguinea/9987294/Papua-New-Guinea-urged-to-halt-witchcraft-violence-after-latest-sorcery-case.html |title=Papua New Guinea urged to halt witchcraft violence after latest 'sorcery' case |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with killings both of victims [[Murder for body parts#Medicine murder|for their supposedly magical body parts]], and of suspected witchcraft practitioners.

Suspicion of modern medicine due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic [[healthcare]] consequences.

{{Further information|Witch (word)}}
The word ''witch'' is of uncertain origin. There are numerous etymologies that it could be derived from. One popular belief is that it is "related to the English words wit, wise, wisdom [Germanic root *weit-, *wait-, *wit-; Indo-European root *weid-, *woid-, *wid-]," so "craft of the wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12416396|title=Power in the Name: The Origin and Meaning of the Word &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot;|first=Michael|last=Dilts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is from the [[Old English]] wiccecræft, a compound of "wicce" ("witch") and "cræft" ("craft").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas|title=witchcraft (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=witchcraft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, witches differ from sorcerers in that they don't use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and one may be unaware of  being a witch, or may have been convinced of his/her nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176–9 |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-465-02131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |date=1937 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, as well as some who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |date=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464–5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-297-00220-8}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an [[ideology]] for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.&lt;ref name="Pocs"&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 9–10. The first three categories were proposed by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Alleged practices ===
[[File:A Witch.jpg|thumb|''A Witch'', 1902, by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
Historically the witchcraft label has been applied to practices people believe influence the mind, body, or property of others against their will—or practices that the person doing the labeling believes undermine social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} believe the malefic nature of witchcraft is a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against their will was clearly present in many cultures, as traditions in both folk magic and religious magic have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples appear in early texts, such as those from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. Malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

{{quote|It is argued here that the medical arts played a significant and sometimes pivotal role in the witchcraft controversies of seventeenth century New England. Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Gevitz, N. ""The Devil Hath Laughed at the Physicians": Witchcraft and Medical Practice in Seventeenth-Century New England." Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 55 no. 1, 2000, pp. 5–36. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/15172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people&amp;nbsp;– even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=alleged+practices+witchcraft#v=onepage&amp;q=alleged%20practices%20witchcraft&amp;f=false|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spell casting ====
{{See also|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most widely known characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], "spell" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantation]]s; by the performance of physical [[ritual]]s; by the employment of magical [[herb]]s as amulets or [[potion]]s; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see [[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736–1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necromancy (conjuring the dead) ====
Strictly speaking, "[[necromancy]]" is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]]&amp;nbsp;– although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical [[Witch of Endor]] performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==== Demonology ====
{{main article|Demonology}}
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], Protestants, and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. The key century was the fifteenth, which saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft, culminating in the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' but prepared by such fanatical popular preachers as Bernardino of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;For this dramatic rise in witchcraft consciousness during the fifteenth century and Bernardino's critical role in it, see Chapter 2 (pp. 52–108) Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-53854-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word [[Warlock]] came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' (Latin for "Hammer of The Witches") was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false |title=The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788|publisher= Britannica Educational Publishing |page=27 |accessdate=2013-06-29|isbn=9781615303434 |date=2011-01-15 |editor-last1= Campbell|editor-first1=Heather M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on the work,&lt;ref&gt;'In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.', Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), 'Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was later officially condemned by the Catholic Church in 1490.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

==== White witches ====

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term "witch" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. As Alan McFarlane noted, "There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=+interchangeable+terms+for+these+practitioners,+&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study|first=Alan|last=Macfarlane|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415196123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scot]] explained, "At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scot |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Scot |date=1584 |title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft |volume=Booke V |chapter=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as "witches" in the negative sense. Many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20witches%20black%20witches&amp;f=false Alan Macfarlane p. 127 who notes how "white witches" could later be accused as "black witches".]&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' ("diviner-healers") were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft".&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a horned male deity or a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===
[[Éva Pócs]] states that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or [[Occultism]]

She identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
* The "neighbourhood witch" or "social witch": a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The "magical" or "sorcerer" witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The "supernatural" or "night" witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Neighbourhood witches" are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of "sorcerer" witches and "supernatural" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence related to accusations====
Belief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such incidents are common in places such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tanzania]]. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance. Witchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf |title=A Global Issue that Demands Action |publisher=the Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1 |title=CONFLICT BETWEEN STATE LEGAL NORMS AND NORMS UNDERLYING POPULAR BELIEFS: WITCHCRAFT IN AFRICA AS A CASE STUDY |publisher=DUKE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE &amp; INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol 14:351 |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |title=WITCH HUNTS IN MODERN SOUTH AFRICA: AN UNDER-REPRESENTED FACET OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE |publisher=MRC-UNISA Crime, Violence and Injury Lead Programm |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425074549/http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/opinions/columns/AHRC-ETC-056-2011 |title=NEPAL: Witchcraft as a Superstition and a form of violence against women in Nepal — Asian Human Rights Commission |publisher=Humanrights.asia |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mensah Adinkrah |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/10/4/325.abstract |title=Witchcraft Accusations and Female Homicide Victimization in Contemporary Ghana |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=325–356 |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07|doi=10.1177/1077801204263419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft ===
{{Further information|Neoshamanism|Modern paganism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as "witchcraft" have grown dramatically since the early 20th century. Generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[ritual]] and [[spirituality]], they are understood to involve varying degrees of [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|magic]], [[shamanism]], [[folk medicine]], [[spiritual healing]], calling on [[elemental]]s and [[spirit]]s, veneration of ancient [[Pantheon (religion)|deities]] and [[archetype]]s, and attunement with the forces of nature.

The first [[Neopagan]] groups to publicly appear, during the 1950s and 60s, were [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]. They operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7591-0202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wicca ====
{{Main article|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pan-European witch-cult]] originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner's]] claim in 1954 in ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=978-1-86163-110-7|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=978-1-86163-164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large "Eclectic Wiccan" movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205–252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939–1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35–62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed "witches." They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=====Witchcraft, feminism, and media=====
Wiccan literature has been described as aiding the empowerment of young women through its lively portrayal of female protagonists. Part of the recent growth in Neo-Pagan religions has been attributed to the strong media presence of fictional works such as the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Harry Potter]] series with their depictions of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=tosenberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosenberger|first=Catherine|title=Neo-Paganism for teens|url=http://jeunessejournal.ca/index.php/yptc/article/view/81/63|journal=Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures|volume=2.2|year=2010|pages=172–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread accessibility to related material through internet media such as chat rooms and forums is also thought to be driving this development. Wiccan beliefs are currently often found to be compatible with liberal ideals such as the [[Green movement]], and particularly with [[feminism]] by providing young women with means for empowerment and for control of their own lives.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=Christine|title=Becoming a woman through Wicca: Witches and wiccans in contemporary teen fiction|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=39|issue=1|year=2008|pages= 43–52|doi=10.1007/s10583-007-9058-0|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4140/2/CLE_Jarvis_Wicca_article_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merskin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|title=Joining Forces: Teen Girl Witches and Internet Chat Groups|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/1/3/0/p171306_index.html |journal=Proceedings of the International Communication Association|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case particularly in North America due to the strong presence of feminist ideals.&lt;ref name=tosenberger/&gt; The 2002 study [[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]] suggests that Wiccan religion represents the second wave of feminism that has also been redefined as a religious movement.&lt;ref name=jarvis/&gt;

==== Stregheria ====
{{Main article|Stregheria}}
Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional witchcraft ====
{{Main article|Traditional witchcraft}}
Traditional witchcraft is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of witchcraft. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===
{{main article|Satanism|Satanism and Witchcraft}}
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi's]] Sabbatic goat (known as The Goat of Mendes or [[Baphomet]]) is one of Satanism's most common symbols.]]

[[Satanism]] is a broad term referring to diverse beliefs that share a symbolic association with, or admiration for, [[Satan]], who is seen as a liberating figure. While it is heir to the same historical period and pre-Enlightenment beliefs that gave rise to modern witchcraft, it is generally seen as completely separate from modern witchcraft and Wicca, and has little or no connection to them.

Modern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the "dark side of Christianity" rather than a branch of Wicca: – the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)&lt;ref name=JamesRLewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&amp;q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966).  After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31–34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=March 2006|title=Religious Satanism, 16th century Satanism, Satanic Dabbling, etc|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|author=B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the [[British Royal Navy]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Helen.

[[Luciferianism]], on the other hand, is a belief system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm|title=How Luciferians Differ From Satanists|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not revere the [[devil]] figure or most characteristics typically affixed to [[Satan]].

[[Madeline Montalban]] was an English witch who adhered to a specific form of luciferianism which revolved around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=26, 85–86}} Although initially seeming favourable to Gerald Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=69}} She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, [[Charles Cardell]], although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n tradition, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and his wife, [[Maxine Sanders]], who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=69–70}} In contemporary times luciferian witches exist within traditional witchcraft.{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}}

== Historical and religious perspectives ==
===Near East beliefs===
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile Valley]]. It played a conspicuous role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. The latter tradition included an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] anti-witchcraft ritual, the [[Maqlû]]. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes:

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L.

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main article|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]
The [[King James Version]] uses the words "witch", "witchcraft", and "witchcrafts" to translate the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} ''kāsháf'' ({{IPA-he|kɔˈʃaf}}) and {{hebrew|קֶסֶם}} (''qésem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate {{lang|grc|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeia'' in the [[Greek New Testament]]. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11–12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live") thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]] in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, usually translated as "witch" or "sorceress", is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeía'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, φαρμακεία, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that "witch" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} include "mutterer" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning "herb", and ''hapaleh'', meaning "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means "herbalist" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33–35 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:
{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word {{hebrew|אֹב}} ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6). The word in most New Testament translations is "sorcerer"/"sorcery" rather than "witch"/"witchcraft".

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.

However, some of the rabbis practiced "magic" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than "unclean" forces) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9–10) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.

==== Islam ====
Divination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460 “Magic”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

Also according to the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|publisher=Routledge|others=Leaman, Oliver, 1950-, Credo Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781780343686|location=Abingdon, Oxon [England]|pages=381|oclc=764567609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And they follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon.

Islam distinguishes between God-given gifts, which can heal sickness, and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Good supernatural powers are therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', whereas sorcery or black magic is achieved through help of [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]]. In the Qurʾānic narrative, the [[Solomon in Islam|Prophet Sulayman]] had the power to speak with animals and command jinn, and he thanks God for this نعمة (i.e. gift, privilege, favour, bounty), which is only given to him with God’s permission.{{Cite Quran|27|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir Ibn Kathir'' for surah 21, verse 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was accused of being a magician by his opponents.{{Cite Quran|10|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1374|title=Magic - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of seeking help from the jinn is prohibited and can lead to possession. The ''ruqya'' contains verses of the Qur'an as well as prayers specifically targeted against demons. The knowledge of which verses of the Qur'an to use in what way is what is considered "magic knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[tagati]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as "witch", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as "witch doctor" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a "witch doctor" is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga''{{'}}s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

Complimentary remarks about witchcraft by a native Congolese initiate: "From witchcraft ... may be developed the remedy (''kimbuki'') that will do most to raise up our country."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.12).&lt;/ref&gt; "Witchcraft ... deserves respect ... it can embellish or redeem (''ketula evo vuukisa'')."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.14).&lt;/ref&gt; "The ancestors were equipped with the protective witchcraft of the clan (''kindoki kiandundila kanda''). ... They could also gather the power of animals into their hands ... whenever they needed. ... If we could make use of these kinds of witchcraft, our country would rapidly progress in knowledge of every kind."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, pp. 54b-55a (13.9.16).&lt;/ref&gt; "You witches (''zindoki'') too, bring your science into the light to be written down so that ... the benefits in it ... endow our race."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 55b (13.10.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cameroon ====

In eastern Cameroon, the term used for witchcraft among the [[Maka people|Maka]] is ''djambe''&lt;ref&gt;Geschiere, Peter; "''The Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa''" (1997) University of Virginia Press. {{ISBN|0-8139-1703-4}} (paperback). Translated by Geschiere, Peter &amp; Roitman, Janet from the originally published in French: "''Sorcellerie et politique en Afrique – La viande des autres''" (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to a force inside a person; its powers may make the proprietor more vulnerable. It encompasses the occult, the transformative, killing and healing.&lt;ref&gt;''idem'' (Geschiere, 1997, p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Every year, hundreds of people in the [[Central African Republic]] are convicted of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312100813/http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-balaka|Christian militias]] in the Central African Republic have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive women accused of being 'witches' in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Esslemont 2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Esslemont | first=Tom | title=Witch burning rebels stoke Central African Republic violence | newspaper=Reuters | date=26 November 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-witchcraft/witch-burning-rebels-stoke-central-african-republic-violence-idUSKBN0TF03920151126 | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====
{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Dowden in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 |title=Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcism]]s, sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html|title=Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists|website=Christianity Today|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis snatching]]) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bavier |first=Joe |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Penis theft panic hits city.. |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, the belief in magical warfare technologies (such as "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, even if it is suboptimal at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nunn |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Nunn |last2=Sierra |first2=Raul Sanchez de la |date=2017 |title=Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=582–87 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20171091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this is one reason why the belief in witchcraft persists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Ghana ====
In [[Ghana]], women are often accused of witchcraft and attacked by neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108050152/http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |title=My Mum is Not A Witch |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there exist six [[witch camp]]s in the country where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety.&lt;ref name="Camps"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19437130 | title=Ghana witch camps: Widows' lives in exile | publisher=BBC | accessdate=September 1, 2012| work=BBC News | date=September 2012 | last1=Whitaker | first1=Kati }}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch camps, which exist solely in Ghana, are thought to house a total of around 1000 women.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt;

Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has "stolen" a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja |first=Uchenna |title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kenya ====
It was reported on May 21, 2008 that in [[Kenya]], a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 |title=Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches" |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malawi ====
In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011. Hunting the vulnerable: Witchcraft and the law in Malawi; Consultancy Africa Intelligence (16 June):&lt;/ref&gt; Various secular and Christian organizations are combining their efforts to address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meer, Erwin 2011. The Problem of Witchcraft in Malawi, Evangelical Missions Quarterly (47:1, January): 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William Kamkwamba]], witches and wizards are afraid of money, which they consider a rival evil. Any contact with [[cash]] will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.&lt;ref&gt;Kamkwamba, William. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Harper Collins. 2009. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
In [[Nigeria]], several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business—which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593|title=Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria|website=humantrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017185346/http://humantrafficking.org/publications/593|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by "detecting" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of "exorcisms", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
Among the Mende (of [[Sierra Leone]]), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. "The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kuranko language]], the term for witchcraft is ''suwa'ye''&lt;ref&gt;West, Harry G. "''Ethnographic Sorcery''" (p.24); 2007. The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-89398-3}} (pbk.), {{ISBN|0-226-89398-7}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "extraordinary powers".

==== Tanzania ====
In [[Tanzania]] in 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly condemned [[witchdoctor]]s for killing [[Albinism|albinos]] for their body parts, which are thought to bring good luck. 25 albinos have been murdered since March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7518049.stm Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, albinos are often murdered for their body parts on the advice of witch doctors in order to produce powerful amulets that are believed to protect against witchcraft and make the owner prosper in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/blogs/?p=348|title=Wicasta 2011.

=== Americas ===
==== Caribbean ====

Brua is an Afro-Caribbean religion and healing tradition that originates in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean. A healer in this culture is called a ''kurioso'' or ''kuradó'', a man or woman who performs ''trabou chikí'' (little works) and ''trabou grandi'' (large treatments) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns, in which sorcery is involved. Sorcery usually involves reference to the ''almasola'' or ''homber chiki'', a devil-like entity. ''Transcultural Psychiatry'' published a paper called "Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua" by Jan Dirk Blom, Igmar T. Poulina, Trevor L. van Gellecum and Hans W. Hoek of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016204|title=Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua|first1=Jan Dirk|last1=Blom|first2=Igmar|last2=T.

==== Colonial North America ====
[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html |title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents |publisher=Masslive.com |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1645–1663, about eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft. Thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1645–1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93. These witch trials were the most famous in [[British North America]] and took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Prior to the witch trials, nearly 300 men and women had been suspected of partaking in witchcraft, and 19 of these people were hanged, and one was “pressed to death”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America: A Narrative History|year=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-393-91265-4|page=85|author=George Brown Tindall|edition=Brief Ninth Edition, Volume One|author2=David Emory Shi |editor=Jon Durbin. Retrieved 10/3/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. [[Giles Corey|One man]] who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]]. The best known trials were conducted by the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692 in Salem Town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education|title=Salem Witch Museum|website=www.salemwitchmuseum.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the "Witch of Pungo" was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

In Maryland, there is a legend of Moll Dyer, who escaped a fire set by fellow colonists only to die of exposure in December&amp;nbsp;1697. The historical record of Dyer is scant as all official records were burned in a courthouse fire, though the county courthouse has on display the rock where her frozen body was found. A letter from a colonist of the period describes her in most unfavourable terms. A local road is named after Dyer, where her homestead was said to have been. Many local families have their own version of the Moll Dyer affair, and her name is spoken with care in the rural southern counties.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Thompson, "Sister Witch: The Life of Moll Dyer" (2017 Solstice Publishing) {{ISBN|978-1973105756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of witchcraft and wizardry led to the prosecution of a man in Tennessee as recently as 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topix.com/forum/city/jamestown-tn/TPAPB6U4LVF0JDQC8/p2|title=Old Stories|work=Topix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1wvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67|title=History of Fentress County, Tennessee|last1=Hogue|first1=Albert Ross|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Touring the East Tennessee Backroads |first=Carolyn |last=Sakowski|page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLBrUbj02IcC&amp;pg=PA212|isbn=9780895874764 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Crucible]]'' by Arthur Miller is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the [[Salem witch trials]] that took place in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during 1692–93.

==== Diné / Navajo ====
In [[Navajo people|Diné culture]], witches are seen as the polar opposite of [[medicine man|ceremonial people]]. While spiritual leaders perform "[[Navajo song ceremonial complex|sings]]" for healing, protection and other beneficial purposes, all practices referred to as "witchcraft" are intended to hurt and curse. Witches are associated with harm to the community and transgression of societal standards, especially those relating to family and the dead.

The ''yee naaldlooshii'' is the type of witch known in English as a "[[skin-walker]]". They are believed to take the forms of animals in order to travel in secret and do harm to the innocent.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "with it, he goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of  ''{{lang|nv|’ánti’įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Corpse powder or corpse poison ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}}}, literally "witchery" or "harming") is a substance made from powdered corpses.  The powder is used by witches to curse their victims.&lt;ref name="PerroneStockel1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrone|first1=Bobette|last2=Stockel|first2=H. Henrietta|last3=Krueger|first3=Victoria|title=Medicine women, curanderas, and women doctors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApJayEh43ZcC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2512-1|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the ''{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}'' is a curse and disease, usually indicated by an immediate action to administration of the poison, like fainting, swelling of the tongue, or [[Trismus|lockjaw]]. Sometimes, however, the victims simply [[wasting|wastes away]], as from a normal disease.

Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico, during the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a "conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged."&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Ruth. ''Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico.'' American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, Asunción. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an "affirmation of hegemony" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of mirrors: power, witchcraft, and caste in colonial Mexico.'' Durham, N.C.:Duke University Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, notoriety has been awarded to a place called [[Catemaco#The "witches" of Catemaco|Catemaco]], in the state of Veracruz, which has a history of witchcraft, and where the practice of witchcraft by contemporary ''brujos'' and ''brujas'' thrives.

In Mexico City, people who practice brujería, [[Santería]], voodoo, ocultism and magic may find items, herbs and supplies at the ''[[mercado de Sonora]]''.

==== South America ====
In [[Chile]] there is a tradition of the [[Kalku]] in [[Mapuche religion]]; and the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] in the folklore and [[Chilote mythology]].

The presence of the witch is a constant in the [[ethnographic]] [[history]] of [[colonial Brazil]], especially during the several denunciations and confessions given to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of [[Bahia]] (1591–1593), [[Pernambuco]] and [[Paraíba]] (1593–1595).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} João Ribeiro Júnior, ''O Que é Magia'', p.48-49, Ed.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Okabe - The cat witch.jpg|thumb|Okabe – The cat witch, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]

In Japanese folklore, the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of "The Grateful foxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes – Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services. The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires. It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master's enemies. The most feared power of the ''kitsune-mochi'' is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or "hereditary witches".&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''Tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

==== Philippines ====
Witchcraft in [[the Philippines]] is often classified as malevolent, with practitioners of black magic called ''[[Mangkukulam]]'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and ''[[Mambabarang]]'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]; there are also practitioners of benevolent, white magic, in addition to some who practise both. ''Mambabarang'' in particular are noted for their ability to command insects and other invertebrates to accomplish a task, such as delivering a curse to a target.

Magic and witchcraft in the Philippines varies considerably across the different [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]], and is commonly a modern manifestation of [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] spirituality interwoven with [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] religious elements such as the invocation of [[saints]] and the use of [[pseudo-Latin]] prayers (''oración'') in spells, and ''[[anting-anting]]'' (amulets).

Practitioners of traditional herbal-based medicine and divination called ''[[albularyo]]'' are not considered witches. They are perceived to be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. [[Feng shui]], an influence of [[Filipino Chinese]] culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.

=== Europe ===
{{Main article|European witchcraft|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}
[[File:Die Hexe (Albrecht Dürer).jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht Dürer]] circa 1500: Witch Riding Backwards On A Goat]]
[[File:Sejdmen.jpg|thumb|During the Christianisation of Norway, King [[Olaf Trygvasson]] had male [[völva]]s (shamans) tied up and left on a [[skerry]] at [[tide|ebb]].]]Witchcraft in Europe between 500–1750 was believed to be a combination of sorcery and heresy. While sorcery attempts to produce negative supernatural effects through formulas and rituals, heresy is the Christian contribution to witchcraft in which an individual makes a pact with the Devil. In addition, heresy denies witches the recognition of important Christian values such as baptism, salvation, Christ and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witchcraft|last=Monter|first=E. William|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the witch accusations in Europe took place in the 14th and 15th centuries; however as the social disruptions of the 16th century took place, witchcraft trials intensified.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witch Trials: Their Foundations in Popular and Learned Culture, 1300–1500|last=Kiekhefer|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge|year=201|isbn=|location=|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of witches.  Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions | url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Early Modern European tradition, witches were stereotypically, though not exclusively, women.&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;Gibbons, Jenny (1998) "Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt" in [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/POM ''The Pomegranate''] #5, Lammas 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Nevill (1992) ''Dictionary of Mysticism and the Esoteric Traditions'' Revised Edition. Bridport, Dorset: Prism Press. "Witch".&lt;/ref&gt; European pagan belief in witchcraft was associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and dismissed as "diabolical fantasies" by medieval Christian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regino of Prüm]] (906), see Ginzburg (1990) part 2, ch. 1 (89ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch-hunt]]s first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest [[Germany]] were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684, 1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commonly believed that individuals with power and prestige were involved in acts of witchcraft and even cannibalism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thornton, John. "Cannibals, Witches, and Slave Traders in the Atlantic World." The William and Mary Quarterly 60, no. 2 (2003): 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Europe had a lot of power over individuals living in West Africa, Europeans in positions of power were often accused of taking part in these practices. Though it is not likely that these individuals were actually involved in these practices, they were most likely associated due to Europe’s involvement in things like the slave trade, which negatively affected the lives of many individuals in the Atlantic World throughout the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) "The Emergence of the Christian Witch" in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle witches]], commonly involves a [[deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe "[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover. They were also depicted as lustful and perverted, and it was thought that they copulated with the devil at the Sabbath.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] . Other rulers such as [[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.
[[File:Torturing and execution of witches in medieval miniature.jpg|thumb|Burning witches, with others held in Stocks, 14th century]]
The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BC–186BC).

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or wise man. The term "witch doctor" was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[Charmer (folklore)|charmer]]s.)

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in  Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996)  pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis." ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173296 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daemonologie1.jpg|thumb|Illustration of witches, perhaps being tortured before [[James VI and I|James VI]], from his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597)]]
In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500." ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536–1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales." ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] Brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male [[homosociality]] among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community." ''CLIO'' (2008) 37#3 pp 322–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cook Islands ====
In pre-Christian times, witchcraft was a common practice in the [[Cook Islands]]. The native name for a sorcerer was ''tangata purepure'' (a man who prays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA372|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=372|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers offered by the ''ta'unga'' (priests)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA471|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=471|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods worshiped on national or tribal ''[[marae]]'' (temples) were termed ''karakia'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=156|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on minor occasions to the lesser gods were named ''pure''. All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down from generation to generation with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a [[Gardenia taitensis|Gardenia]] was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a journalist who visited the Cook Islands in 1907, the uncrowned [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] was believed to have possessed the mystic power called ''[[mana]]'',  giving the possessor the power to slay at will.

=== Russia ===
Among the [[Russian language|Russian]] words for ''witch'', ведьма (ved'ma) literally means "one who knows", from Old Slavic вѣдъ "to know").&lt;ref&gt;See also Ryan, W.F. ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent term is колдунья (koldun'ya), ''sorcerer'' being колдун (koldun).

==== Spells ====
Pagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.
&lt;/ref&gt;  One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanicals should be gathered, "During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right."&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"/&gt;  Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The western concept of an "evil eye" or a "hex" was translated to Russia as a "spoiler".&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal view of witchcraft ====
The dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a "whisperer" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).&lt;ref&gt;
Christine D. Worobec, 1995. "Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages." Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual’s self is often deemed as "feminine" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192–194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witchcraft trials ====
[[File:"A true and just recorde of the information"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]

Witchcraft trials occurred frequently in seventeenth-century Russia, although the "great witch-hunt" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominately Western European phenomenon.  However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called "witch hysteria."  This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.  Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
Russell Zguta, "Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia," American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: " [so she must be a witch]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqRCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sentence for an individual found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the "ordeal of cold water" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"&gt;Zguta, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but was used as a method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy.  Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them "brought back," but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two methods of torture were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century.  Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present.  In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.&lt;ref&gt;
Zguta, 1187.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts—astrology, fortune telling, and divination—became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"&gt;Zguta, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547–1584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"/&gt;  Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565–1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles.  Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598–1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Time of Troubles, seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the ground, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.

== Witches in art ==
Witches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a "witch-craze" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Patricia. "THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART." Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the "protectress of childbirth and fertility" while Herodias symbolized "unbridled sensuality". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
One of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht Dürer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.&lt;ref&gt;Stumpel, Jeroen. “The Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in Dürer's ‘Four Witches.’” Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143–160., www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Dürer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as "[sucking] the blood of newborn infants"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as "practitioners of witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an "earthly alliance" had taken place between Satan's female minions who "conspired to destroy Christendom".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Hoak, Dale. "THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE." ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their "flight-inducing [powers]". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Works of mercy''' (sometimes known as '''acts of mercy''') are practices which [[Christians]] perform.

The practice is popular in the [[Catholic Church]] as an act of both [[penance]] and [[charity (virtue)|charity]]. In addition, the [[Methodism|Methodist church]] teaches that the works of mercy are a [[means of grace]] which lead to holiness&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Stephen Bowden|title=Encyclopedia of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGAUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=works+of+mercy+methodism&amp;dq=works+of+mercy+methodism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FT0TTrqAO4jl0QHH_dS-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|quote=Works of mercy are, therefore, not merely good deeds but also channels through which Christians receive God's grace.|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aid in [[sanctification]].&lt;ref name="Sanctification"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wesley]]|title=The Works of the Reverend John Wesley, A.M., Volume VI|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4BPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=works+of+mercy+sanctification&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Xj8TTt6pHMnd0QHt84C5Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=works%20of%20mercy%20sanctification&amp;f=false|publisher=J.

The works of mercy have been traditionally divided into two categories, each with seven elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=R Mauriello|first1=Matthew|title=Mercies Remembered|date=2011|isbn=9781612150055|pages=149-160}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# "Corporal works of mercy" which concern the material needs of others.
# "Spiritual works of mercy" which concern the spiritual needs of others.

[[Pope John Paul II]] issued a papal encyclical "''[[Dives in misericordia]]''" on 30 November 1980 declaring that "Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called 'to practice mercy' towards others."&lt;ref name=Misericordia &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia_en.html Pope John Paul II, ''Dives in misericordia'', §14, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, November 30, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the [[Divine Mercy]], which derives from apparitions of [[Jesus Christ]] to [[Saint Faustina Kowalska]].

==In the Catholic Church==
Based on Jesus' doctrine of [[the sheep and the goats]], the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a [[means of grace]] as good deeds&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2447|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their omission is a reason for damnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|25:31-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|1287|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believes Jesus obeyed every [[mitzvah]] and fulfilled the Scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Philippians|2:8}}; {{Bibleverse|Matthew|5:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics perform the works of mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|520|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally.&lt;ref name=Cathencycle &gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10198d.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Corporal and Spiritual Works of Mercy'']&lt;/ref&gt; In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, [[Pope Francis]] suggested "care for creation" as a new work of mercy, describing it as a "complement" to the existing works. Francis characterized this new work as having both corporal and spiritual components. Corporally, it involves "daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness". Spiritually, it involves contemplating each part of creation to find what God is teaching us through them.&lt;ref name="Francis 2016"&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-message-on-world-day-of-prayer-for-cr Pope Francis: Message on 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation] As a spiritual work of mercy, care for our common home calls for a “grateful contemplation of God’s world” (Laudato si', 214) which “allows us to discover in each thing a teaching which God wishes to hand on to us” (ibid., 85). As a corporal work of mercy, care for our common home requires “simple daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness” and “makes itself felt in every action that seeks to build a better world”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewane Cantu 2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dewane |first1=Frank J. |authorlink1=Frank J.

===Corporal Works of Mercy===
[[File:Barmherzigkeitsfenster, Freiburger Münster.jpg|thumb|The six Corporal Works of Mercy, [[Freiburg Minster]], ca. 1230]]
[[File:Pierre Montallier 001.jpg|thumb|''Works of Mercy'' by [[Pierre Montallier]], 1680]]
[[File:1605 Francken sieben Werke der Barmherzigkeit anagoria.JPG|thumb|[[Frans Francken the Younger|Frans II Francken]], The Seven Works of Mercy, 1605 ([[Deutsches Historisches Museum|German Historical Museum Berlin]])]]

Corporal works of mercy are those that tend to the bodily needs of other creatures. They come from Isaiah 58&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mitzvah of hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hospitality.html Jewish Library: Hospitality in Judaism] In Judaism, showing hospitality (hakhnasat orchim) to guests is considered a mitzvah. When one knows of strangers who are hungry or need a place to relax, it becomes a legal obligation. Some rabbis consider hakhnasat orchim (literally the “bringing in of strangers”) to be a part of gemilut hasadim (giving of loving kindness).&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh work of mercy comes from the [[Book of Tobit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/tobit/1 Tobit 1:16-22] 16In the days of Shalmaneser I had performed many charitable deeds for my kindred, members of my people. 17h I would give my bread to the hungry and clothing to the naked. If I saw one of my people who had died and been thrown behind the wall of Nineveh, I used to bury him.* 18Sennacherib returned from Judea, having fled during the days of the judgment enacted against him by the King of Heaven because of the blasphemies he had uttered; whomever he killed I buried. For in his rage he killed many Israelites, but I used to take their bodies away by stealth and bury them. So when Sennacherib looked for them, he could not find them. 19But a certain Ninevite went and informed the king about me, that I was burying them, and I went into hiding. When I realized that the king knew about me and that I was being hunted to be put to death, I became afraid and took flight. 20All my property was confiscated; I was left with nothing. All that I had was taken to the king’s palace, except for my wife Anna and my son Tobiah.* 21But forty days did not pass before two of the king’s sons assassinated him and fled to the mountains of Ararat. A son of his, Esarhaddon,* succeeded him as king. He put Ahiqar, my kinsman Anael’s son, in charge of all the credit accounts of his kingdom, and he took control over the entire administration.i 22Then Ahiqar interceded on my behalf, and I returned to Nineveh. Ahiqar had been chief cupbearer, keeper of the signet ring, treasury accountant, and credit accountant under Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians; and Esarhaddon appointed him as Second to himself. He was, in fact, my nephew, of my father’s house, and of my own family.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the mitzvah of burial,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282548/jewish/The-Basics.htm Chabad: The taharah, funeral and burial] Jewish law is unequivocal in its insistence that the body, in its entirety, be returned to the earth, in a way that allows for the natural process of its decomposition and re-integration with its primordial source--the soil of which it was formed. It also insists that in the interim between death and interment, the integrity and dignity of the body be respected and preserved.&lt;/ref&gt; although it was not added to the list until the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/new-work-of-mercy-enshrined-in-first-papal-message News.Va: New work of mercy] Since biblical times, Christians have been called to carry out 6 acts of mercy, listed in St Matthew’s Gospel – giving food and drink to the hungry and thirsty, welcoming the stranger, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and the prisoners – with a 7th one, burying the dead, added in medieval times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works include:
# To feed the hungry.
# To give water to the thirsty.
# To clothe the naked.
# To shelter the homeless. 
# To visit the sick.
# To visit the imprisoned, or ransom the captive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10198d.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
# To bury the dead.&lt;ref name="Catechism"&gt;[http://scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2447.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church par. 2447] The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. The corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying the dead.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual Works of Mercy===
Just as the corporal works of mercy are directed towards relieving corporeal suffering, the aim of the spiritual works of mercy is to relieve spiritual suffering. The first four come from Ezekiel 33,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/nasb/ezekiel/33.htm Ezekiel 33:7-9] 7Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them warning from Me. 8“When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand. 9“But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life.&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth comes from the mitzvah of forgiving others before receiving forgiveness from God,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06619.html Jewish Virtual Library: Forgiveness] The rabbis go even further in the ethical demands made upon the injured party, for not only must he be ready to forgive his injurer, he should also pray that God forgive the sinner before he has come to beg forgiveness (Yad, loc. cit.; Tosef., BK 9:29; Sefer Ḥasidim ed. by R. Margalioth 1957, 267 no. 360). This demand is based on the example of Abraham, who prayed to God to forgive Abimelech (Gen. 20:17). The reasons the injured party should be ready to forgive the injurer are mixed. On the one hand is the self-regarding consideration, already mentioned, that forgiveness to one's fellow wins forgiveness from Heaven. As Philo states: "If you ask pardon for your sins, do you also forgive those who have trespassed against you? For remission is granted for remission" (ed. by Mangey, 2 (1742), 670; see also Yoma 23a). On the other hand there is the purer motive of imitatio dei. Just as it is in the nature of God to be merciful to His creatures, so man in attempting to imitate the ways of God should be forgiving toward those who have injured him (Shab. 133b; see Lev. 19:2). R. Naḥman combines both motives when he says: "Imitate God by being compassionate and forgiving. He will in turn have compassion on you, and pardon your offenses" (op. cit. 81–91).&lt;/ref&gt; the sixth comes from Deuteronomy 15,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm Deuteronomy 15:11] For the poor will never cease to be in the land; therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.’&lt;/ref&gt; and the seventh comes from Maccabees 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/2mc/12 2 Maccabees 12:42] Turning to supplication, they prayed that the sinful deed might be fully blotted out. The noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen&lt;/ref&gt;

The works include:
#To instruct the ignorant.
#To counsel the doubtful.
#To admonish the sinners.
#To bear patiently those who wrong us.
#To forgive offenses.
#To comfort the afflicted.
#To pray for the living and the dead.&lt;ref name="Catechism"/&gt;


[[File:Werken van Barmhartigheid, Meester van Alkmaar (1504).jpg|thumb|center|850px|[[Master of Alkmaar]], ''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Master of Alkmaar)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]'', ca. 1504, polyptych ([[Amsterdam]], [[Rijksmuseum]])]]

=== Representation in art ===
The Corporal works of mercy are an important subject of Christian iconography. In some representations of the [[Middle Ages]], the seven works were allegorically juxtaposed with the seven deadly sins (avarice, anger, envy, laziness, unchastity, intemperance, pride). The pictorial representation of the works of mercy began in the 12th century.
[[File:Caravaggio - Sette opere di Misericordia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]] by [[Caravaggio]], 1606/07 (Naples)]]
The [[Master of Alkmaar]] painted the polyptych of the ''Seven works of mercy'' (ca. 1504) for the [[Grote of Sint-Laurenskerk (Alkmaar)|Church of Saint Lawrence]] in [[Alkmaar, Netherlands]]. His series of wooden panel paintings show the works of mercy, with Jesus in the background viewing each, in this order: feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, shelter the traveler, comfort the sick, and ransom the captive.

The painting of the ''Seven Works of Mercy'' by [[Frans Francken the Younger|Frans II Francken]] (1605) represents the acts not as a picture cycle, but in one single composition.

A major work of the iconography of mercy is the altarpiece of [[Caravaggio]] (1606/07) in [[Naples]], which was commissioned by the Confraternità del [[Pio Monte della Misericordia]] for their church. This charity brotherhood was founded in 1601 in Naples. The artist painted the ''Seven Works of Mercy'' in one single composition. Regarding the sharp contrasts of the painting’s [[chiaroscuro]], the art historian [[Ralf van Bühren]] explains the bright light as a metaphor for [[mercy]], which "helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples.

In [[Methodist]] teaching, doing merciful acts is a prudential means of grace.&lt;ref name="Wesley2"&gt;
