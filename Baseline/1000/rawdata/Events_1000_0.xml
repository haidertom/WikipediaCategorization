Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or [[spiritual transformation]], and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt; Others suggested that the date marked the [[End time|end of the world]] or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], an interaction between [[Earth]] and the [[Sagittarius A*|black hole at the center of the galaxy]],&lt;ref name="NASA1" /&gt; or [[Nibiru cataclysm|Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru]].

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name="Brown 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI do not ♥ pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA2" /&gt;

== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],&lt;ref name="delara2006" /&gt; it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Population structure of the classic period Maya" /&gt; The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt; meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|European conquest]].

Unlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}&lt;ref name="The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0" /&gt;

=== Apocalypse ===
[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]

There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429–430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's "zero date"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}&lt;ref name=yucalandia/&gt; This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."&lt;ref name="makemson1957" /&gt; In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that "there is a suggestion&amp;nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus&amp;nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}

=== Objections ===
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="carrasco1990" /&gt; In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; it did not mark the end of the calendar.&lt;ref name="milbrath1999" /&gt; "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; "There will be another cycle," said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this."&lt;ref name="The Sky Is Not Falling" /&gt; Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xultún]], one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&amp;nbsp;– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."&lt;ref name="NG120510" /&gt;

Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.&lt;ref name="prensalibre" /&gt;

=== Prior associations ===
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profecías]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hoopes 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst Förstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann 1906: 264&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1915: 32&lt;/ref&gt; who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&amp;nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Maya references to b'ak'tun 13 ==
It is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.

=== Tortuguero ===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

&lt;div style="width: 500px"&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
: ''tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik''
: ''chan ajaw u:x uni:w''
: ''uhto:m il[?]''
: ''ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'''
: ''ta chak joyaj''
{{col-2}}
: It will be completed the 13th ''b'ak'tun''.
: It is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K'ank'in''
: and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].
: It is the display of ''B'olon-Yokte'''
: in a great "investiture".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}
{{col-end}}
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of B'olon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]

Very little is known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.&lt;ref name="eberl2005" /&gt; He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.&lt;ref name="hieroglyphic" /&gt;

Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36–37}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.&lt;ref name="What Will Not Happen in 2012" /&gt;

=== La Corona ===
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13 ===
Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&amp;nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&amp;nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&amp;nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}

Another example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;×13×360 days,&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt; or roughly 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Maya Creation Myths and Cosmography|author=Wagner, Elizabeth|editor=Grube, Nikolai|title=Maya: Divine Kings of the Rainforest|page=283|year=2000|publisher=Konemann|isbn=978-3-8290-4150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=49}}

In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in [[Xultún]], Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.&lt;ref name="NG120510"&gt;{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Eric | title = Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth |work=National Geographic |date=10 May 2012 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/ |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saturno et al. 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 11 May 2012 | volume = 336 | issue = 6082 | pages = 714–717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1221444 | title = Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala |author1=William A.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}

=== Origins ===
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],&lt;ref name="particular" /&gt; while both [[José Argüelles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')&lt;ref name="elles1975" /&gt; and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mckenna1993" /&gt; discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.

In 1983, with the publication of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,''{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.&lt;ref name="Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elles1987" /&gt; He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17–27}}

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The End of the World As They Know It" /&gt; Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&amp;nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt;

=== Galactic alignment ===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref name="Hoopes2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoopes2012" /&gt; Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".

==== Precession ====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115–127}}

Similarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center" /&gt; Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.&lt;ref name="What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?" /&gt; In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;

==== Mysticism ====
[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]

Mystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975). 

Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or "Black Road".&lt;ref name="Xibalba or Xibalbe" /&gt; John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.&lt;ref name="The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" /&gt; New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.&lt;ref name="pinchbeck2006" /&gt; Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].&lt;ref name="jenkins1998" /&gt; Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}

==== Criticism ====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.&lt;ref name="jenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Alignment Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus1997" /&gt;

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,&lt;ref name="grofe2011" /&gt; Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref name="jenkins2009" /&gt; have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices,{{refn|{{harvnb|Aveni|2009|pp=54–55}}, citing {{harvnb|Aveni|Hartung|2000}}.}} but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=57}}

=== Timewave zero and the ''I Ching'' ===
{{Main|Terence McKenna#Novelty theory and Timewave Zero}}
[[File:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the "Timewave Zero" software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt; [[Terence McKenna]] claimed that the universe has a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt; The [[scientific community]] considers novelty theory to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=A. |year=2009 |title=2012: Science Or Superstition (the Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon) |publisher=The Disinformation Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-rVUCO4YyYC&amp;pg=PA261|isbn=978-1-934708-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=normark&gt;{{cite web |title=2012: Prophet of nonsense #8: Terence McKenna – Novelty theory and timewave zero |last=Normark |first=Johan |url=http://haecceities.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/2012-prophet-of-nonsense-8-terence-mckenna%E2%80%93-novelty-theory-and-timewave-zero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'', an ancient Chinese book on [[divination]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;

The 1975 first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} of 21 December 2012 throughout.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt;

Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Smith II D.

The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of [[human civilization]], became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the [[Internet]], particularly on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; [[The Discovery Channel]] was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment".&lt;ref name="PressSunBulletin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121210/NEWS01/312110007/Cornell-Maya-expert-World-probably-won-t-end-Dec-21?odyssey=nav%7Chead|title=Cornell Maya expert: World probably won't end Dec. 21 |last=D.W.

=== Other alignments ===
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), creating havoc on Earth.&lt;ref name="krupp" /&gt; Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 [[light year]]s from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.&lt;ref name="Questions answered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What would happen if a supermassive black hole came close to the Earth?" /&gt; This reading of the alignment was included on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Decoding the Past''. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45&amp;nbsp;minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".&lt;ref name="How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" /&gt;

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; According to the [[Shiva Hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.&lt;ref name="Perturbing the Oort Cloud" /&gt; However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.&lt;ref name="Galactic Plane" /&gt; Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.&lt;ref name="The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane" /&gt;

A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.&lt;ref name="Planetary Alignment" /&gt; [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above ≈300&amp;nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]], the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Plait-alignment" /&gt;

=== Geomagnetic reversal ===
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="2012: No Killer Solar Flare" /&gt; This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] was weakening,&lt;ref name="Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core" /&gt; which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]], and the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], which was expected sometime around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storm Warning|publisher=NASA|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/10mar_stormwarning/|year=2006|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete,&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Merrill | first1 = Ronald T. | last2 = McElhinny | first2 = Michael W. | last3 = McFadden | first3 = Philip L. | title = The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year = 1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not start on any particular date.&lt;ref name="Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of [[sunspots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Maximum: Three Solar Flares And A Coronal Mass Ejection As The Sun Reaches Peak Solar Activity|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/solar-maximum-three-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejection-sun-reaches-peak-solar-activity-1442608|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.&lt;ref name="2012: No Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.&lt;ref name="goemag" /&gt; David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer [[Michio Kaku]], who claimed in an interview with [[Fox News]] that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt;

=== Planet X/Nibiru ===
{{main|Nibiru cataclysm}}

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet&amp;nbsp;X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; The idea originated from claims of channeling [[grey aliens|alien beings]] and is widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;{{sfn|Schilling|2008|p=111}} Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

=== Other catastrophes ===
[[File:Pleiades large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pleiades]], a [[star cluster]] with supposed influence sometimes tied to the 2012 event|alt=The Pleiades star cluster]]

Author [[Graham Hancock]], in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''{{sfn|Coe|1992|pp=275–276}} as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.&lt;ref name="hancock" /&gt; Filmmaker [[Roland Emmerich]] later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 [[disaster film]] ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagoscifi credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf | title = 2012 (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Credit List |accessdate=25 November 2009 |publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.&lt;ref name="'Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse" /&gt;

The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.&lt;ref name="Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?" /&gt;

Some media outlets tied the fact that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] would undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Connelly 19 January 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |title=Tatooine's twin suns&amp;nbsp;– coming to a planet near you just as soon as Betelgeuse explodes |last=Connelly |first=Claire |work=News.com.au |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922083805/http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Betelgeuse and 2012" /&gt; To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth.&lt;ref name="Is Betelgeuse about to blow?" /&gt; In December 2011, NASA's [[Francis Reddy]] issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.&lt;ref name="Reddy 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012: Fear No Supernova | publisher = NASA | last = Reddy | first = Francis | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-supernova.html | year = 2011 | accessdate = 23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim involved [[alien invasion]]. In December 2010, an article, first published in [[examiner.com]] and later referenced in the English-language edition of ''[[Pravda]]''&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt; claimed, citing a Second [[Digitized Sky Survey]] photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; Astronomer and debunker [[Phil Plait]] noted that by using the [[small-angle formula]], one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; In January 2011, [[Seth Shostak]], chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army.&lt;ref name="For End of the World, a French Peak Holds Allure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel 2010" /&gt; "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told ''[[The Independent]]'' in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for [[UFO]]s]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal."&lt;ref name=hippies /&gt; In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Doomsday: French Police Block Access to Survivors' Refuge Pic de Bugarach|author=Hanna Osborne|publisher=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129090241/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event".

== Cultural influence ==
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.

The [[UFO conspiracy]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the [[Mayan calendar]] "stopping" on this date.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; The [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005–2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2009), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Armageddon series" /&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]], [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012.&lt;ref name="2012 Apocalypse" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] launched a show called ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]'', a documentary series about [[survivalism|survivalists]] preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic Doomsday Preppers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Doomsday Preppers | work = National Geographic | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of books were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; The bestselling book of 2009,&lt;ref name="Best-Selling Books of 2009" /&gt; [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the [[Julian date]] for 21 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of The Lost Symbol|author1=Dan Bernstein |author2=Arne de Kiuzer |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qgqfqUjF_38C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=2456282.5+julian+date+%22lost+symbol%22|accessdate=19 December 2012|isbn=978-0-297-86060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, the 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic.&lt;ref name="sony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Relax, the end isn't nigh" /&gt; Although the campaign was heavily criticized,&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="2009 Worldwide Grosses" /&gt; An article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building "survival arks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China fears end of the world is nigh|author=Malcolm Moore|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9729270/China-fears-end-of-the-world-is-nigh.html| accessdate=11 December 2012|location=London|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Sunny Kirsten Dunst is picture perfect at the Cannes photocall for her provocative new film Melancholia" /&gt; Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of [[Magnolia Pictures]] said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".&lt;ref name="Magnolia Picks Up North American Rights to Lars von Trier's 'Melancholia'" /&gt;

The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "[[A Certain Shade of Green]]" by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "[[2012 (It Ain't the End)]]" (2010) performed by [[Jay Sean]] and "[[Till the World Ends]]" (2011) performed by [[Britney Spears]]. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet [[hoax]] related to South Korean singer [[Psy]] being one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's "[[Gangnam Style]]" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |title=Much ado about apocalypse |first=Chok |last=Suat Ling |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104174754/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian composer [[A.

A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at [[Boston University]], questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Vanessa |title=Brands Capitalize on 'Impending Apocalypse' |publisher=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-19/brands-capitalizing-on-the-impending-apocalypse|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
* {{note label|A|a|a}} The [[13 (number)|number 13]] plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}&lt;ref name="The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya" /&gt;
* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt;
* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than "0.0.0.0.0", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as "13.0.0.0.0"&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;
* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at 21 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Who's Who in the Maya World" /&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;
* {{note label|E|e|e}} Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011". He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,{{sfn|Coe|1980|p=151}} not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Coe|1984}}. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book.}} The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book ''The Ancient Maya'' {{harv|Morley|1983|p=603|loc=Table B2}}.

The '''999 phone charging myth''' is an [[urban myth]] which claims that if a [[mobile phone]] has low battery then dialing [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] (or any regional [[emergency number]]) charges the phone so it has more power. This was confirmed as a myth by several British police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls.

== Basis ==
The basis for the myth was a feature of [[BlackBerry]] phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone automatically locked down phone features and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services.

'''Abu Salim prison''' ({{lang-ar|سجن أبو سليم}}) is a [[Supermax|maximum security prison]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]]. The prison was notorious during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed.&lt;ref name="notorious Abu Salim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison to be emptied|publisher=[[daylife.com]]|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303080553/http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|archive-date=2011-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison|publisher=geneva lunch|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711083553/http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|archive-date=2011-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN libya death"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Nic|first2=Paul|last2=Cruickshank|url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/23/libya.death/index.html|title=Jihadist death threatened Libyan peace deal|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of human rights abuses==
[[Amnesty International]] has called for an [[Public inquiry|independent inquiry]] into deaths that occurred there on 29 June 1996,&lt;ref name="amnesty 346"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |title=Investigation needed into prison deaths |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317043628/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |archivedate=2015-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an incident which some have referred to as the '''Abu Salim prison massacre'''.&lt;ref name="court celebrates massacre"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|title=Libyan legal court celebrates Abu Salim prison massacre|publisher=[[Arabic News]]|date=24 June 2005|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227211022/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|archive-date=2011-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed. HRW also calls the prison a "site of egregious [[human rights violations]]."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 1270"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2009/10/16/libya-free-all-unjustly-detained-prisoners|title=  Libya: Free All Unjustly Detained Prisoners|publisher=  [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch also stated in a report that they were unable to independently verify the allegations of a massacre. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa’i, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: "I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot..."&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=
Libya: June 1996 Killings at Abu Salim Prison |date=June 27, 2006 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa’i allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated "I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners..."&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Libyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Journalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book "Sandstorm". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]] circa 2007.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], and that some 200 guards were killed too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib|title=Libya appoints judge to probe 1996 prison massacre|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/06/uk-libya-massacre-idUKTRE5850PJ20090906|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=6 September 2009|work=Reuters UK|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators.&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A-HRC-16-15.pdf|work=[[Universal Periodic Review]]|publisher=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]], [[United Nations General Assembly]]|accessdate=26 October 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured [[Mansour Dhao]], a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=30 October 2011 | title=Gaddafi: 'He died an angry and disappointed man' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15516678 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Arab Spring]] occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. [[Abdullah Senussi]], Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

On 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave | work=[[BBC News]] | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: "We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=Mass grave found in Libya with remains of 1,200 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/mass-grave-found-in-libya-with-remains-of-1200/articleshow/10120042.cms | work=[[The Economic Times]] | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave| date=25 September 2011 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the civil war, the lawyer [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]] took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations.&lt;ref name="HRW_GhogaAbuSalim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: Death Toll Up to At Least 233 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=February 2011 |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKvZxgit?url=http://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |archivedate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the uprise Ghoga became speaker  of the [[National Transitional Council]], in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libyan deputy leader steps down after angry protests  |first=Richard |last=Connor |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15683868,00.html |newspaper=Deutche Welle |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Tawfiq Algazwani, a former Libyan citizen who was imprisoned for leading a Human Rights protest in Benghazi. The next day Gaddafi's forces arrested him and took him to Tripoli where he was taken into Abu Salem and imprisoned for 10 years, when he was released he immigrated to Ireland,now in Benghazi and Tripoli. Tawfiq now lives in Dublin, married and has two kids. Tawfiq was released in the 80's and immigrated to Ireland in 1988.

==YouTube videos==
On 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities [[Censorship of YouTube#By country|blocked access to YouTube]] after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]] by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] at parties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Accident-proneness''', also known as '''clumsiness''', is the idea that some people have a greater predisposition than others to suffer [[accident]]s, such as [[car crash]]es and [[industrial injuries]]. It may be used as a reason to deny any [[insurance]] on such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how-insurance-companies-measure-risk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. ''Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee'', Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Present study ==

The subject is still being studied actively.  Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in [[safety engineering]], where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.
One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Statistical evidence ===

Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Doubt ===

However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a ''distinct, persistent and independently verifiable'' physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Nature and causes ===

The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown.  Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included [[absent-mindedness]], [[wikt:clumsiness|clumsiness]], [[carelessness]], [[impulsivity]], predisposition to [[risk]]-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.
Broad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc |title=創造性ﾃｽﾄ、薬不要の風邪治療(妊婦､ｱｽﾘｰﾄ､NSAID)、適性ﾃｽﾄ |publisher=F6.dion.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000135/http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternate ending''' ([[British English]]: '''alternative ending''') is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

==Examples in film==
Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's [[DVD]] release. These alternative endings are a special type of [[deleted scene]]. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:
*''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'': An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like ''The Butterfly Effect'', with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.
*''[[28 Days Later]]'': Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.
*''[[3 Ninjas]]'': The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'', [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[Showtime MAX]]; international [[DVD]]s have this version, as well.
*''[[Army of Darkness]]'': In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams "I slept too long!"
*''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'': When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...
*''[[Blade: Trinity]]'': The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director [[David S. Goyer]]. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.
*''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.
*''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'': Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his [[umbilical cord]] and dies, [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. This "[[Director's Cut]]" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.
*''[[Child's Play 2]]'': An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.
*''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'': After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).
*''[[Clerks]]'': Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.
*''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of ''three'' of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/alternateversions&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'': In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. McClane's police career is in ruins, and he is keen to take it out on Gruber, who he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.
*''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'': The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, "You happy now?")
*''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'': The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.
*''[[Fatal Attraction]]'': Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex "If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.
*''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'': Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.
*''[[Final Destination 2]]'': The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.
*''[[Final Destination 3]]'': The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.
*''[[The Final Destination]]'': In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, "The chain is broken." Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.
*''[[Final Destination 5]]'': In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.
*''[[First Blood]]'': In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.
*''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'': Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.
*''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'': An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.
*''[[Game of Death]]'': This movie has two alternative endings. In the [[Hong Kong]] [[Cantonese]]  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of [[Bruce Lee]]. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.
*''[[Happy Death Day]]'': An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.
*''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'': This movie had many different endings on whether [[Dakota Fanning]]'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.
*''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'': The "Monster Woman" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a "cure" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the "Alpha Monster" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the "Monster Woman" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the "Alpha Monster" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)
*''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'': In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads "I still know". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.
*''[[Infernal Affairs]]'': In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming ([[Andy Lau]]) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.
*''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'': In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.
*''[[Men in Black II]]'': The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.
* ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'': In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.
*''[[Paranormal Activity]]'': In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.
*''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'': Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel "do you believe in fate?" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point.
*''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'': Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down.
*''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'': [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] defeats [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed.
*''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'': Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the café considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.
*''[[Scream 3]]'': When [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices [[Sidney Prescott]] has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending.
*''[[Scary Movie 3]]'': Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from ''The Matrix'' and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].
*''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'': Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release.
*''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'': Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive.
*''[[Smokin' Aces]]'': Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them.
*''[[Super Troopers]]'': Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant.
*''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'': The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.
*''[[The Terminator]]'': The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending.
*''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'': The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'': Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.
*''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'': While Nicole and Michèle waiting in front of Stade Charléty, there was a duel between André and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings.
*''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'': Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of [[Jean Grey]] being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is now a professor; [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] coming back to [[Alberta, Canada]], specifically the very same tavern seen in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''; and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] keeping her powers.
* ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot.
* ''[[Whisper (film)|Whisper]]'': In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling.

==Examples in television==
In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.
*''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'': To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.
*''[[D.I.E]]'': In original ending, Yue Sir ([[Roger Kwok]]) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of [[mo lei tau]] comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening.
*''[[E.U. (TV series)|E.U.]]'': Due to the popularity of [[Michael Tse]]'s character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide.
*''[[Green Wing]]'': In the final [[Green Wing Special|Special]], Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.
*''[[Sex and the City]]'': In the series finale three endings were shot, in which [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'': (1) becomes engaged to [[Aleksandr Petrovsky]], (2) resumes her relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'': In the two part episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was [[Waylon Smithers]] rather than [[Maggie Simpson]]. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.)
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'': At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die.
*''[[Total Drama]]'': For every season of this animated "reality show", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air.
*''[[King of the Hill]]'': Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode "The Company Man"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features.
*''[[Psych]]'': the episode "100 Clues", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided  who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode "Right Turn or Left for Dead" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different.
*''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'': In the episode, "The Lady Killer," three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternate ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's.
*''[[Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series)|Secrets and Lies]]'': In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot.

==Examples in video games==
{{Main|Types_of_fiction_with_multiple_endings#Video_games|l1=Video games with multiple endings}}
Many video games also have alternative endings. These endings are generally posed after completing the game in a harder difficulty, or taking a different route through the game's storyline.

==Examples in music==
*English rock band [[Marillion]]'s 1994 [[concept album]] ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'' is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of ''Brave'' featured a [[multisided record|double groove]] on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs "The Great Escape" and "Made Again") or would instead play only an alternative version of "The Great Escape" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/brave.htm |title=Marillion – 'Brave' |publisher=marillion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
* [[Felix Salten]]’s ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'' differs greatly in the original [[German language]] (''Der Hund von Florenz'') and in the [[English language|English]] translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 | language=German | page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence: A Novel | date=1930 | location=New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | translator=Huntley Paterson | others=Illustrated by Kurt Wiese | pages=230– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

The '''Asia Tour''' was planned to be the eleventh concert tour by Canadian singer Celine Dion. The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celines-concert-dates-japan-announced |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142420/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celines-concert-dates-japan-announced |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have marked Dion's first concerts in Asia since the [[Taking Chances World Tour]] in 2008. While Japan and the Philippines were the only confirmed stops of the tour, it has been revealed that the singer was planned to be performing dates in several Asian countries for the very first time.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Background==
The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014. Japan and the Philippines were officially announced. However, there were unofficial dates and venues for Taiwan, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand but because of the cancellation the ticket were never put on sale. In total, 14 concerts were supposed to take place.

==Commercial performance==
Celine's concerts in Tokyo and Osaka sold out immediately after tickets went on sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hipjpn.co.jp/live/celine/ticket.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
On 13 August 2014, Dion has announced that the tour has been cancelled due to ongoing illness and family issues.

According to a statement released by the singer:

{{cquote|"I want to devote every ounce of my strength and energy to my [[René Angélil|husband]]'s healing, and to do so, it's important for me to dedicate this time to him and to our children," Dion said in a statement.
"I also want to apologize to all my fans everywhere, for inconveniencing them, and I thank them so much for their love and support."&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|title=Celine Dion announces show biz hiatus to focus on ailing husband|work=Celine: Las Vegas Official Website|publisher=[[AEG Live]]|accessdate=13 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813231818/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|archive-date=13 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dion did not return to Asia for a performance until her [[Celine Dion Live 2018|2018 tour]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/8455647/celine-dion-2018-asia-tour-dates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening acts==
In the official announcement for the Japan and Philippine tour, it was revealed that the impersonator [[Véronic DiCaire]] had been invited to join Celine as the opening act for these shows.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Set list==
The official setlist had yet to be announced, although in an exclusive video message to her Japanese fans, Dion promised a new show featuring songs from her latest English album, ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', as well as fan favorites from the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dem_HyX9WcY&lt;/ref&gt; Celine was also rehearsing one song in Japanese and one in Mandarin for the tour.

[[Image:Mount St. Helens, one day before the devastating eruption.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Conical mountain|[[Mount St. Helens]], 9:00 am, May 17, 1980.]]
[[File:MSH80 eruption mount st helens 05-18-80.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Eruption column around 8:35 am on May 18, 1980.]]

'''Catastrophism''' was the theory that the [[Earth]] had largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turney |first=C.S.M. |last2=Brown |first2=H. |year=2007 |title=Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe |journal=[[Quaternary Science Reviews]] |volume=26 |pages=2036–2041 |bibcode= 2007QSRv...26.2036T |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.07.003 |issue=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] (sometimes described as [[gradualism]]), in which slow incremental changes, such as [[erosion]], created all the Earth's [[geology|geological]] features. Uniformitarianism held that the present was the key to the past, and that all geological processes (such as [[erosion]]) throughout the past were like those that can be observed now. Since the early disputes, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the [[scientific consensus]] accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past, but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur.

Catastrophism held that [[geological epoch]]s had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid [[orogeny|formation of major mountain chains]].  Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were [[extinction|made extinct]], being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of [[Noah's flood]].

The concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century French scientist [[Georges Cuvier]], who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided  religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="McG 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133" /&gt;

==History==

===Geology and biblical beliefs===
{{Main article|history of geology}}
In the early development of [[geology]], efforts were made in a predominantly [[Christian]] western society to reconcile biblical narratives of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Universal Flood Myth#Jewish|universal flood]] with new concepts about the processes which had formed the Earth. The discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was "stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the [[Greeks]]", an example being [[Plutarch]]'s account of the [[Universal Flood Myth#Ogyges|Ogygian flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvardnb|King|1877|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuvier and the natural theologians===
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

The leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]]. His motivation was to explain the patterns of [[extinction]] and [[faunal succession]] that he and others were observing in the [[fossil]] record. While he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea, he did not make any reference to [[Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="McG 3"&gt;{{Harvardnb|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event. In fact Cuvier, influenced by the ideas of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the intellectual climate of the [[French revolution]], avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier also believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions, which he viewed as recurring natural events, amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast in Britain, where [[natural theology]] was influential during the early nineteenth century, a group of geologists including [[William Buckland]] and [[Robert Jameson]] interpreted Cuvier's work differently. Cuvier had written an introduction to a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds, discussing his ideas on catastrophic extinction. Jameson translated Cuvier's introduction into English, publishing it under the title ''Theory of the Earth''. He added extensive editorial notes to the translation, explicitly linking the latest of Cuvier's revolutions with the biblical flood. The resulting essay was extremely influential in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence. He frequently cited Cuvier's work, even though Cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration, whereas Buckland, to be consistent with the biblical account, was advocating a universal flood of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Buckland abandoned [[flood geology]] in favor of the [[glaciation]] theory advocated by [[Louis Agassiz]], following a visit to the Alps where Agassiz demonstrated the effects of glaciation at first hand. As a result of the influence of Jameson, Buckland, and other advocates of natural theology, the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in Britain than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of uniformitarianism in geology===
Uniformitarian explanations for the formation of [[sedimentary rock]] and an understanding of the immense stretch of [[geological time]], or as the concept came to be known [[deep time]], were found in the writing of [[James Hutton]], sometimes known as the father of geology, in the late 18th century. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] built upon Hutton's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the Earth's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time. Lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', published in the 1830s, which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like Cuvier and Buckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 1850 to 1980, most geologists endorsed [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] ("The present is the key to the past") and [[gradualism]] (''geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time'') and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as [[earthquakes]], [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time, played any significant role in the formation of the Earth's surface. Instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation, that could still be observed in action today. In part, the geologists' rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that God was directly involved in determining the history of Earth. Some of the theories about Catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with [[religion]] and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered [[Miracle|miraculous]] rather than natural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult. In 1923 [[J Harlen Bretz]] published a paper on the [[channeled scablands]] formed by glacial [[Lake Missoula]] in Washington State, USA. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate. Finally in 1979 Bretz received the [[Penrose Medal]]; the [[Geological Society of America]]'s highest award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm Penrose Medal 1979] to J Harlen Bretz, [[Geological Society of America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Velikovsky's views===
{{Main|Velikovskyism}}
In the 1950s, [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] propounded catastrophism in several popular books. He speculated that the planet [[Venus]] is a former "[[comet]]" which was ejected from [[Jupiter]] and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by Earth, 52 years apart, and later interacted with Mars, which then had a series of near collisions with Earth which ended in 687 BCE, before settling into its current [[orbit]]. Velikovsky used this to explain the biblical [[Ten Plagues|plague]]s of [[Egypt]], the biblical reference to the "Sun standing still" for a day (Joshua 10:12 &amp; 13, explained by changes in Earth's rotation), and the sinking of [[Atlantis]]. Scientists vigorously rejected Velikovsky's conjectures.&lt;ref name="UnMuseum"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krystek |first1=Lee |title=Venus in the Corner Pocket: The Controversial Theories of Immanuel Velikovsky |url=http://www.unmuseum.org/velikov.htm |publisher=Museum of Unnatural Mystery |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current application==
Neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude, low frequency events (such as asteroid impacts, super-volcanic eruptions, supernova gamma ray bursts, etc.), as opposed to the more prevalent [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] thought which emphasises low magnitude, high frequency events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goudie |first1=A. |year= |title=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |page=709 |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luis Alvarez impact event hypothesis===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}

Over the past 25 years, a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past. One impetus for this change came from the publication of a historic paper by [[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. This paper suggested that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Impact event|struck Earth]] 66 million years ago at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving behind the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–T boundary). In 1990, a {{convert|180|km|mi}} candidate crater marking the impact was identified at [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]].

Since then, the debate about the [[extinction]] of the dinosaurs and other [[mass extinction]] events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact, widespread volcanism (which occurred about the same time), or some other mechanism or combination. Most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature.

The observation of the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events.

===Comparison with uniformitarianism===
One of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that uniformitarianism requires the assumption of vast timelines, whereas catastrophism does not. Today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints, taking the view that [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] is a slow, gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |year=2007 |chapter=Uniformitarianism |chapterurl=http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624122338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |archivedate=2006-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moon-formation===
{{Main|Giant impact theory}}
Modern theories also suggest that Earth's anomalously large [[moon]] was formed catastrophically. In a paper published in ''Icarus'' in 1975, [[William K. Hartmann]] and [[Donald R. Davis]] proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large [[planetesimal]] early in Earth's formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris, remelted Earth and formed the [[Moon]], thus explaining the Moon's lesser density and lack of an iron core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Gott III |first=J.

'''''Chase's Calendar of Events''''' is an annual American publication, started in 1957 by brothers William (Bill) D. Chase (a [[journalist]] and [[publisher]] from [[Michigan]]), and Harrison V. Chase (a university [[social scientist]] from [[Florida]]).&lt;ref name="nyt-2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/dining/30holi.html | title = Having a Snack?

The brothers gathered information on events and the first edition of 2,000 copies was printed for 1958. "It was 32 pages, contained 364 entries and sold for $1", while recent editions are 752 pages and contain more than 12,000 entries.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; A promotion sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce was added in 1958: a pamphlet listed commercial promotions as Special Days, Weeks and Months, and remained in future editions.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; Contemporary Books in Chicago, Illinois, took over publication in 1983 and the Chases retired in 1987 from compiling the calendar, which is now handled by an in-house staff of editors and researchers. Contemporary Books was acquired by [[Tribune Media|Tribune]] in 1993 and sold to [[McGraw-Hill Companies]] in September 2000. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Tribune acquisitions: Tribune Co. said Tuesday it reached...| work = tribunedigital-chicagotribune| accessdate = 2016-08-02| url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-07-06/news/9307070173_1_contemporary-books-tribune-distribution-of-interactive-multimedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; McGraw-Hill sold the property to [[Rowman and Littlefield|Rowman and Littlefield Publishing Group]] in January 2015, where it is now published by Bernan Press, an imprint of RLPG. &lt;ref&gt;Rowman and Littlefield press release, Jan 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine.]]
The '''Chronology of the Great Famine''' ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') documents a period  of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proximate cause]] was [[famine]] resulting from a potato disease commonly known as [[late blight]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, ''Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives'', Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Ireland{{spaced ndash}}where a third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for food{{spaced ndash}}was exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain the subject of historical debate.

An important and controversial point of debate, that is notable amongst Irish people, was that Irish food supplies were sufficient until it was taken away by the British the feed the British, and the landlords kept economic benefits to themselves. Some commentators and writers controversially compared this explanation to "genocide".

&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith, ''The Great Hunger'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991, p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-14-014515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, pp. xvi–ii, 2–3. {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==

===1845===

====August====
At the beginning of August, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the British Prime Minister, received news of a potato disease in the South of England. This was the first recorded evidence that the 'blight' which had ravaged the potato crop in North America in 1843-1844 had crossed the Atlantic. Cecil Woodham-Smith would write that a failure in England would be serious, but for Ireland, it would be a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39&lt;/ref&gt;

====September====
Following earlier reports of incidences of the blight in England, on 13 September 1845 &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}} pg.32 put the date at the 16th&lt;/ref&gt; potato blight was first reported in Ireland. The crops at Dublin were suddenly perishing, it was reported in the ''Gardeners' Chronicle'', asking "where will Ireland be in the event of a universal potato rot?"  The British Government were nevertheless optimistic through the next few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

====October====
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|[[Skibbereen]] 1847 by [[Cork (city)|Cork]] artist [[James Mahony]] (1810–1879), commissioned by the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]
*As soon as digging of potato crops began, devastating reports started coming in. Sir Robert Peel found the accounts 'very alarming' and writing to Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary on 13 October reminded him that there was always a tendency in Irish news to exaggerate.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.41&lt;/ref&gt; Constabulary Reports from the 15 reported great failures, Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary wrote that the truth about the potato crop, until digging was completed, could not be fully ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.42&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] was prompted to act,&lt;ref&gt;''The Course of Irish History'' (1994) edited by T.W.Moody and F.X.Martin. Page 268. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|1-85635-108-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 October he decided to summon an emergency meeting of his Cabinet for 31 October. The remedy he decided was to repeal the [[Corn Laws]].&lt;ref name="cws-p50"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.50&lt;/ref&gt; Peel then decided to set up a Scientific Commission to go to Ireland and investigate the potato blight and report on conditions.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergency Cabinet meeting met on 31 October till 1 November. The first day consisted of reading reports and memoranda from Ireland on the potato failure. Peel proposed that a relief commission be established in Ireland, and a sum of money be advanced to the Lord -Lieutenant. Differences arose when Peel pointed out that these measures required an advance of public money. The purchase of food for destitute districts would open the question of [[Corn Laws]]. Was it possible, it was asked, to vote public money for the sustenance of a people on account of "actual or apprehended scarcity" and still maintain restrictions on the free import of grain; Peel declared it was not.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.51&lt;/ref&gt; On this issue then the Cabinet split, the overwhelming majority voting against Peel.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to reach a decision, the Cabinet adjourned till 6 November.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;

The principle of the Corn Laws had been to keep the price of home-grown grain up. Duties on imported grain assured English farmers a minimum and profitable price. The burden of a higher price for bread was carried by the labouring classes, in particular factory workers and operatives. It was claimed that if the Corn Laws were repealed all those connected with the land would be ruined and the established social organisation of the country destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

According to Cecil Woodham-Smith, the rising wrath of Tories and landlords ensured "all interest in Ireland was submerged."  She writes that the Tory Mayor of Liverpool refused to call a meeting for the relief of Irish distress. She continues that the [[Mansion House Committee]] in Dublin was accused of 'deluding the public with a false alarm', and the blight itself 'was represented as the invention of agitators on the other side of the water'. The entanglement of the Irish famine with the repeal of the Corn Laws, she says, was a key misfortune for Ireland. The potato failure was eclipsed by the domestic issue of Corn Law repeal. The Irish famine, she writes, "slipped into the background."&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

====November====

*On 9–10 November&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 54&lt;/ref&gt; Peel ordered the secret purchase of £100,000 worth of [[Maize|Indian corn]] and meal from America for distribution in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.49&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 November the Scientific Commissioners reported that half the potato crop had been destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;
*On 19 November the Mansion House Committee in Dublin claimed to have "ascertained beyond the shadow of doubt that considerably more than one-third of the entire potato crop...has been already destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.43&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 20 November the Relief Commission first met.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52, Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 57&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unable to persuade his Cabinet to repeal the Corn Laws, on 5 December Peel tendered his resignation &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.37&lt;/ref&gt; to Queen Victoria but was reinstated days later when [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] was unable to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1846===
The first deaths from hunger took place in early 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keneally (1999) ''The Great Shame''. London: Vintage: 110&lt;/ref&gt; In March Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland but was forced to resign as Prime Minister on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 78–86&lt;/ref&gt; The new Whig administration under [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], influenced by their [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 408–11&lt;/ref&gt; then halted government food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without any work, money or food.&lt;ref name="david2002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 224, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Grain continued to be exported from the country.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; Private initiatives such as The Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) attempted to fill the gap caused by the end of government relief and eventually the government reinstated the relief works, although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; The blight almost totally destroyed the 1846 crop and the Famine worsened considerably.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; By December a third of a million destitute people were employed in public works.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 311&lt;/ref&gt;

===1847===
[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Leave Ireland'', engraving by Henry Doyle (1827–1892), from Mary Frances Cusack's Illustrated History of Ireland, 1868]]
There were average crop yields in the 1847 harvest, but due to lack of seed potatoes to plant, the crop was low.&lt;ref&gt;Líam Kennedy, Paul S. Ell, E. M. Crawford &amp; L. A. Clarkson, Mapping The Great Irish Famine, Four Courts Press, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85182-353-0}} pg.69&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds began to throng the public works during the last months of 1846 and the start of 1847, which promoted exactly the social conditions for the spread of 'famine fever.'&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.173&lt;/ref&gt; In late January and February, legislation called the Temporary Relief Act went through the British parliament; it became popularly known as the Soup Kitchen Act and occasionally as Burgoyne's Act.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 136&lt;/ref&gt; This system of relief was designed to deliver cheap food directly and gratuitously to the destitute masses. This system of relief would be terminated in September.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg. 81–85&lt;/ref&gt; The government also announced an additional change in the system of relief. After August 1847, the permanent Poor Law was to be extended and was to become responsible for providing relief and as a result, all relief would be financed by the local Poor Law rates.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; This put impossible loads on local poor rates, particularly in the rural west and south.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 174–187&lt;/ref&gt; With the mass emigration of the famine era, the horrors of the '[[coffin ships]]' and 1847 have ever since been associated in the popular mind, according to James S. Donnelly.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.179&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1847 The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847]] was enacted due to growing Irish nationalist agitation that was causing the British government concern about a possible [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|violent rebellion]] against British rule in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, Cecil [[The Great Hunger]] Ireland1845 1849 Harper and Row   New york pages 326-327&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill gave the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] the power to organise the island into districts and bring police forces into them at the districts' expense. It limited who could own guns, and required all of the men in the district between the ages of 16 and 60 to assist in apprehending suspected murderers when landlords were killed, or else be guilty of a misdemeanour themselves.

===1848===
The blight returned in 1848 and outbreaks of cholera were reported.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Evictions became common among the Irish who could not keep up with the demands of their British landlords. Famine victims on outdoor relief peaked in July at almost 840,000 people.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; On 29 July [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|an uprising against the government]] was led by [[William Smith O'Brien]]. After a skirmish at "[[Famine Warhouse 1848|Widow McCormack's house]]" in the village of [[Ballingarry, South Tipperary|Ballingarry]], [[County Tipperary]] the leaders of the rebellion fled to America or were sentenced to transportation.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kee (2000) ''The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism'': 270-89&lt;/ref&gt;

===1849===
The potato crop failed again in 1849 and famine was accompanied by cholera outbreaks.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; This deadly cholera epidemic killed one of Ireland's greatest poets: [[James Clarence Mangan]].&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;

===1850===

===1851===
By 1851 census figures showed that the population of Ireland had fallen to 6,575,000 – a drop of 1,600,000 in ten years.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Cormac Ó Gráda and Joel Mokyr have described the 1851 census as a famous but flawed source. They contend that the combination of institutional and individuals figures gives "an incomplete and biased count" of fatalities during the famine.&lt;ref name="cormac2006"&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland’s Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, University College Dublin Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The famine left in its wake up to a million dead and another million emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 226&lt;/ref&gt; The famine caused a sense of lasting bitterness by the Irish towards the British government, whom many blamed — then and now — for the starvation of so many people.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; The fall-out of the famine continued for decades afterwards.

[[File:Perilsofpauline.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1914 ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|Perils of Pauline]]'', which popularized the term '''cliffhanger''' in the medium of film.]]

A '''cliffhanger''', or '''cliffhanger ending''', is a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma, or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode&lt;ref&gt;Some are placed before commercial breaks&lt;/ref&gt; of serialized fiction. A cliffhanger is hoped to ensure the audience will return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma.

Some serials end with the caveat "To Be Continued…" or "The End?"  In [[movie serials]] and [[television series]], the following episode sometimes begins with a [[recap sequence]].

==History==
The cliffhanger plot device dates back to the famous medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary]] work, the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The [[framing device]] has [[Scheherazade]] narrating a [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|series of stories]] to King [[Shahryār]] for 1,001 nights, with each night ending on a cliffhanger, in order to save herself from execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire.|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=1438119062|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&amp;pg=PT292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444351729|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8tPlht9lyAC&amp;pg=PT86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers later appeared as an element of the Victorian [[serial (literature)|serial novel]] that emerged in the 1840s, with many associating the form with [[Charles Dickens]], a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction.&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite news|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|publisher=The New Yorker|date=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040341/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;Grossman, Jonathan H. (2012). Charles Dickens's Networks: Public Transport and the Novel. p. 54. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s it had become a staple part of the sensation serials, while the term itself originated with [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1873 when a protagonist from one of his serials, Henry Knight, was left hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Hardy"/&gt;

===Victorian serials and term origin===

Cliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction, pioneered by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"/&gt; Printed episodically in magazines, Dickens’s cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers. Writing in the ''New Yorker'', Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'';

{{quote|In 1841, Dickens fanboys rioted on the dock of New York Harbor, as they waited for a British ship carrying the next installment, screaming, “Is little Nell dead?.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;}} 

The impact of Dickens' serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rob (2014). "Serialization in Popular Culture". p. 41. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cliffhanger" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left hanging off a [[cliff]].&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diniejko,|first1=Andrzej|title=Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes As a Cliffhanger with a Post-Darwinian Message|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=27 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032925/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial media==
Cliffhangers were especially popular in 1920s and 1930s [[Serial film|serials]] when [[movie theater]]s filled the cultural [[niche market|niche]] later primarily occupied by [[television]]. Cliffhangers are often used in [[television series]], especially [[soap opera]]s that end each episode on a cliffhanger. Prior to the early 1980s, season-ending cliffhangers were rare on U.S. television. The first such season-ender on U.S. TV was in the [[comedy]] send-up of soap operas ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' in 1978. Several [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]]s, which went off air over summer, such as ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Restless Years]]'', and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', ended each year with major and much publicized catastrophe, such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year's closing episode.

Cliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In contrast to American [[superhero comics]], Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers, often with each volume or issue. This is particularly the case with [[shōnen manga]], especially those published by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', and ''[[One Piece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mylonas|first1=Eric|title=Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors|date=2004|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0761546758|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHxLR1C8JBEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brandweek, Volume 47|journal=[[Brandweek]]|date=January 2006|volume=47|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bplaAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Adweek L.P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original run, [[Doctor Who]] was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger. In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. [[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire Part One]] is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] literally hanging from a cliff. This has been frequently criticised by fans for being a pointless cliffhanger, but script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] gave an explanation for the reasoning of it in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|title=A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Dragonfire|author=|date=|website=www.shannonsullivan.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200758/http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|archivedate=2015-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers were rare on American television before 1980, as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order. The phenomenal success of the 1980 "[[Who shot J.R.?]]" third season-ending cliffhanger of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and the "[[Who Done It (Dallas)|Who Done It]]" fourth-season episode that finally solved the mystery, contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on television.&lt;ref name="meisler19950507"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/arts/television-when-j-r-was-shot-the-cliffhanger-was-born.html?pagewanted=all | title=TELEVISION; When J. R.

The two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers/viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful, possibly life-threatening situation, or to feature a sudden shocking revelation. Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role.

Cliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned, in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved. Such was the case with the second season of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist, but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled, resulting in the unresolved ending.

The cliffhanger has become a genre staple (especially in comics, due to the multi-part storylines becoming the norm instead of self-contained stories). To such a degree, in fact, that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved, or even referenced, when the next episode is shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |title=The IT Crowd: Tramps Like Us |publisher=Noise to Signal |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311215959/http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; variously because the writer didn't feel it was "a strong enough opener,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |title=…and we like tramps! « Why, That\’s Delightful! |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324010610/http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "couldn't be bothered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Falk |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1014/1014434_one_of_the_it_crowd.html |title=One of the IT Crowd &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News - menmedia.co.uk |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavily serialized television drama ''[[True Blood]]'' has become notorious for cliffhangers. Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers, but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |title='True Blood' Finale Sets Up More Cliffhangers |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020081054/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commercial break]]s can be a nuisance to [[screenwriter|script writer]]s because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break. Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory [[dénouement]], but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out.

Sometimes a movie, book, or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second, evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance (becoming the villain of the next film). Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel.

In most instances, the effect is a rather negative one as it has disrupted many Africans’ traditional norms and practices. For instance, many West African communities rely on [[Traditional African medicine|traditional healers]] and [[witch doctors]], who use herbal remedies, massage, chant, and witchcraft to cure just about any ailment.&lt;ref name="afro.who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4216-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-3-july-2014.html|title=Ebola virus disease, West Africa – update 3 July 2014|publisher=WHO|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesleymc.com/util/documents/TraditionsThatMayImpactEbolaTransmission.pdf |title=West African Cultural Norms/Traditions That May Impact Ebola Transmission |publisher=HCA |accessdate=9 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109123732/http://wesleymc.com/util/documents/TraditionsThatMayImpactEbolaTransmission.pdf |archivedate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it is difficult for West Africans to adapt to foreign medical practices. Specifically, West African resistance to Western medicine is prominent in the region, which calls for severe distrust of Western and modern medical personnel and practices.{{small|(see [[Cultural effects of the Ebola crisis#Ebola conspiracies|Ebola conspiracies]] below.)}}&lt;ref name=Gassel&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publichealth.tufts.edu/About-Us/Public-Health-Rounds-Newsletter/How-Cultural-Norms-and-Practices-Impact-Ebola-OutbreakPage |title=How Cultural Norms and Practices Impact Ebola Outbreak |author= Sammi Gassel&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Tufts University |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, some African cultures have a traditional [[solidarity]] of standing by the sick, which is contrary to the safe care of an Ebola patient.&lt;ref name="afro.who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; This tradition is known as "standing by the ill" in order to show one's respect and honor to the patient. According to the Wesley Medical Center, these sorts of traditional norms can be dangerous to those not infected with the virus as it increases their chances of coming in contract with their family member's bodily fluids.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; In [[Liberia]], Ebola has wiped out entire families, leaving perhaps one survivor to recount stories of how they simply could not be hands off while their loved ones were sick in bed, because of their culture of touch, hold, hug and kiss.&lt;ref name="nyt20141005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/africa/ebolas-cultural-casualty-hugs-in-hands-on-liberia.html|title=Ebola’s Cultural Casualty: Hugs in Hands-On Liberia|publisher=The New York Times|first=Helene|last=Cooper|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some communities traditionally use [[folklore]] and mythical literature, which is often passed on verbally from one generation to the next to explain the interrelationships of all things that exist. However the folklore and songs are not only of traditional or ancient historical origins, but are often about current events that have affected the community. Additionally, folklore and music will often take opposing sides of any story. Thus early in the Ebola epidemic, the song "White Ebola" was released by a [[diaspora]] based group and centers on the general distrust of "outsiders" who may be intentionally infecting people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m11/background.php|title=A brief background and history of African literatures|publisher=Exploring Africa|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="culanth592"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culanth.org/fieldsights/592-beats-rhymes-and-ebola|title=Beats, Rhymes and Ebola|publisher=Boima Tucker|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This initial misinformation increased the general distrust in foreigners, and the idea that Ebola was not in Africa before their arrival led to attacks on many health workers as well as blockages of aid convoys blocked from checking remote areas. A burial team, which was sent in to collect the bodies of suspected Ebola victims from [[West Point, Monrovia|West Point]] in Liberia, was blocked by several hundred residents chanting: "No Ebola in West Point." Health ministries and workers started an aggressive Ebola information campaign on all media formats to properly inform the residents and allow aid workers safe access to the high risk areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-workers-battle-trust-issues-attacks-in-ebola-outbreak/|title=Health workers battle trust issues, attacks in Ebola outbreak|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-armed-men-attack-liberia-ebola-clinic-freeing-patients/|title=Report: Armed men attack Liberia Ebola clinic, freeing patients|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Guinea]], riots broke out after medics disinfected a market in [[Nzerekore]].

== West African cultural traditions and norms==
[[File:Response volunteers in Nigeria.jpg|thumb|right|Volunteers distribute health information in Nigeria.]]
The Ebola epidemic of 2014 has forced West Africans to face numerous difficulties on daily basis regarding their traditional norms and practices. In essence, their traditions have been severely disrupted due to the [[Ebola virus]]. For instance, Africans have had the tendency to remain close to their sick family members to nurse them during illness for centuries. Unfortunately for the African community, many have been encouraged to keep their distance from their infected family members as potential contact could be fatal. In addition, it is part of their culture to touch the deceased at funerals and for the sister of the deceased’s father to bathe, clean, and dress the corpse in a favorite outfit. When there is not an aunt to perform this task, a female elder in their community is then held responsible. Not only is it customary to wash and touch the deceased, but also to kiss those that have passed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Specifically, funerals are considered to be major cultural events for families and friends to gather around to celebrate the deceased. The funeral performances, which involve wailing and dancing, is done out of care and respect for the dead. Funerals in Africa often last for several days, depending on the status of the person who died. In other words, the more important the person who died was while they were alive, the longer the mourning will last. More importantly, there is a common bowl used for ritual hand-washing towards the end of the ceremony, including a final kiss or touch on the face, which is to be bestowed on the dead. This is commonly referred to as a "love touch."  The [[Wesley Medical Center]] has confirmed that prohibiting African families from performing such rites is a disgrace as it insults the deceased, putting the remaining family in danger. Specifically, it is believed that the dead person’s spirit, also known as "tibo," will cause harm and bring illness to the family as a result of an improper burial.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt;

===Resistance to Western medicine===
Resistance to Western medicine is considered to be a significant barrier to battling the Ebola virus.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt; The Wesley Medical Center claims that the interference with African burial rituals caused by Western medical practices has prohibited them from properly honoring their loved ones.  They believe that this may have been a reason for heightened distrust in medical professionals, and that the mistrust enhances each time family members of infected persons are prohibited from participating in the funeral or seeing the dead body in person.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Due to the mistrust Ebola-stricken communities in Liberia reportedly hid family members with Ebola from health care providers and held secret burials.&lt;ref name=Ravi&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sociocultural Dimensions of the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Liberia|url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|journal = Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science|date = 2014-10-23|issn = 1538-7135|pages = 301–305|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|first = Sanjana J.|last = Ravi|first2 = Eric M.|last2 = Gauldin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sierra Leone health workers made more progress because health measures were implemented according to WHO guidance, which advises health workers to heed the traditions of the threatened communities when attending to the dead. Therefore, funerals were held in agreement with the wishes of the families, but also gave health workers an opportunity to disinfect the bodies.&lt;ref name=Ravi/&gt; In many of the Ebola infected areas in Africa, Western medicine is also believed either to be ineffective or to be the actual origin of the virus. In other words, there is a belief among the African community that Western doctors are intentionally killing their patients with their treatments. A conspiracy theory also says that the medical professionals are planning to harvest the organs of those dying from Ebola.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

Resistance to Western medicine exists also because of the look of the hazmat suits, which are worn by healthcare workers to protect themselves from becoming infected with the Ebola virus.  The protective equipment is said to frighten many West Africans and also believed to be hostile and intimidating to the African families.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt; Lastly, the interference in the family’s care for the patient diminishes the honor of the patient as well as hindering the family’s duty to provide comfort and care.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Regardless of the existing resistance towards Western medicine, handling the bodies of the deceased poses a high risk of contagion as Ebola is contracted through physical contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. This is mainly because preparation for burial includes touching, washing, and kissing as is mentioned above. Those that are preparing for the funeral can become easily infected as they can easily become exposed to the infected person’s blood, vomit, diarrhea, and other bodily fluids as these are the main symptoms of the virus.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

===Traditional medical practices===
Apart from the fact that traditional African healers have been using ritual and herbal remedies for many centuries, the African people also trust these treatments and find the costs more affordable. Traditional procedures include the following:  magic, biomedical methods, fasting, dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, as well as surgery. Surgical procedures often involve cutting a patient’s skin with unsterilized knives.   Sometimes, traditional healers apply blood to the skin to rid them of their sickness.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Despite the severe distrust of Africans in modern medicine, the Ebola virus has been said to spread rampantly across West Africa due to a shortage of healthcare workers and limited medical resources and facilities. The unsanitary conditions in the overall African region have also made it easier for Ebola to spread.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

== Personal account of a West African student==

Alakey Osei, a student and bank-teller from [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]], described the Sierra Leonean capital as a ghost-town, as a result of the increasing death toll in the [[West Africa]]n region caused by the [[Ebola epidemic]].  Osei states that "everyone is scared to be out of their houses. No one is going to church or mosque, no one is going to work, the kids are not going to school, [and] people are not even going to the market place".  The fact that the city of Freetown has been completely abandoned is foreign to the student, because the nation is and has always been heavily reliant on physical contact and very close interaction. Osei has indicated that following the no touching rule that the medical personnel have been promoting is extremely difficult for her. Osei continues by saying that she does not even know how her people are surviving.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In her interview, Osei provides some insight about her childhood. She moved to US in 2008 when she was thirteen years old. She experienced extensive bullying for her obliviousness to [[American culture]] and simply for being the "uncivilized" African.  For example, others had asked her if she was getting accustomed to wearing shoes since people do not wear shoes in Africa. She was also called names, such as monkey and pre-historic. As a result of this cruelty, she began to believe that American culture was very cold. She also noticed that Americans were "protective of their property", space, and time. She concluded that American society is "extremely individualistic". This truly made her miss living in Africa, "... where every woman is your mother and every man is your father, ... where you are never alone, because everyone is family and family is all around you".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As of October 2014, the Ebola virus had not reached her home-town back in Sierra Leone; however, she said that her family still living in the country claimed that Freetown did not "feel like the same place" anymore. Her aunt had told her that people were not sharing food anymore nor spending time at each other's houses as they used to because of the fear of becoming infected. Osei finds it heart-breaking that people in Sierra Leone have turned to isolation as a way to stay Ebola-free. Osei now says that "Freetown has become Fear-town", and that "Ebola has turned us into prisoners in our own country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_ccf50fda-4f0a-11e4-858f-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Student from Sierra Leone tells of cultural impact of Ebola |author=Rosemond Crown&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 8, 2014 |website=Hilltop Views |publisher=Hilltop Views |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bushmeat==
The Ebola virus, for which the primary host is suspected to be [[Megabat|fruit bats]], has been linked to [[bushmeat]], which is commonly consumed in areas of West Africa that use it as a protein source. Although primates and other species may be intermediates, evidence suggests people primarily get the virus from bats. Hunters usually shoot, net, scavenge or catapult their prey, and butcher the bats without gloves, getting bites or scratches and coming in contact with their blood.&lt;ref name=camghana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/understanding-the-bushmeat-market-why-do-people-risk-infection-from-bat-meat|title=Understanding the bushmeat market: why do people risk infection from bat meat?|work=Research News|publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Hogenboom | first1 = Melissa | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29604204 | publisher = BBC News | title = Ebola: Is bushmeat behind the outbreak? | date = October 18, 2014 | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the suspected [[index case]] for the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola outbreak in West Africa]] is a two-year-old child in [[Guéckédou Prefecture|Guéckédou]] in south-eastern Guinea, who was the child of a family that hunted two species of fruit bat,&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"/&gt; ''[[Hammer-headed bat|Hypsignathus monstrosus]]'' and ''[[Franquet's epauletted fruit bat|Epomops franqueti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/voice-field/struggling-contain-ebola-epidemic-west-africa | publisher = MSF USA | title = Struggling to Contain the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa | date = July 8, 2014 | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers suggested the case was caused by [[Zoonosis|zoonotic transmission]] though the child playing with an [[Microbat|insectivorous bat]] from a colony of [[Angolan free-tailed bat]]s near the village.&lt;ref name=EMBOMM123014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Almudena Marí Saéz |author2=Sabrina Weiss |author3=Kathrin Nowak |author4=Vincent Lapeyre |author5=Fee Zimmermann |author6=Ariane Düx |author7=Hjalmar S Kühl |author8=Moussa Kaba |author9=Sebastien Regnaut |author10=Kevin Merkel |author11=Andreas Sachse |author12=Ulla Thiesen |author13=Lili Villányi |author14=Christophe Boesch |author15=Piotr W Dabrowski |author16=Aleksandar Radonić |author17=Andreas Nitsche |author18=Siv Aina J Leendertz |author19=Stefan Petterson |author20=Stephan Becker |author21=Verena Krähling |author22=Emmanuel Couacy‐Hymann |author23=Chantal Akoua‐Koffi |author24=Natalie Weber |author25=Lars Schaade |author26=Jakob Fahr |author27=Matthias Borchert |author28=Jan F Gogarten |author29=Sébastien Calvignac‐Spencer |author30=Fabian H Leendertz |title=Investigating the zoonotic origin of the West African Ebola epidemic|journal=EMBO Molecular Medicine|date=December 30, 2014|issue=Published online|doi=10.15252/emmm.201404792|url=http://embomolmed.embopress.org/content/early/2014/12/29/emmm.201404792|accessdate=December 31, 2014|publisher=EMBO Press|format=online|quote=The severe Ebola virus disease epidemic occurring in West Africa likely stems from a single zoonotic transmission event involving a 2‐year‐old boy in Meliandou, Guinea, who might have been infected by hunting or playing with insectivorous free‐tailed bats living in a nearby hollow tree|volume=7|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/|title=Ground zero in Guinea: the outbreak smoulders – undetected – for more than 3 months|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite health organisations warning about risks of bushmeat, surveys pre-dating the 2014 outbreak indicate that people who eat bushmeat are usually unaware of the risks and view it as healthy food. Because of bushmeat's role as a protein source in Western Africa, it is traditionally associated with good nutrition, and efforts to outlaw the sale and consumption of bushmeat have been impossible to enforce and have met with suspicion from rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/239123/icode/|title=FAO warns of fruit bat risk in West African Ebola epidemic|work=FAO|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that between 30 and 80 percent of protein intake in rural households in Central Africa comes from wild meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/news_151010.html|title=Bushmeat consumption, wildlife trade and global public health risks|work=FAO|date=15 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ebola conspiracies ==
* The ''[[Liberian Observer]]'', a major Liberian newspaper, has repeatedly published Ebola-related conspiracy theories. In September 2014 it published an article claiming that Ebola and the [[HIV|AIDS virus]] are [[GMO|genetically modified organisms]] to be used as [[Biological warfare|bio-weapons]] on Africans in an attempt to reduce Africa’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/security/ebola-aids-manufactured-western-pharmaceuticals-us-dod|title=Ebola, AIDS Manufactured by Western Pharmaceuticals, US DoD?|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/17/the-major-liberian-newspaper-churning-out-ebola-conspiracy-after-conspiracy/  "The major Liberian newspaper churning out Ebola conspiracy after conspiracy", [[The Washington Post]], Terrence McCoy, October 17, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; In October the story went viral on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2014/10/28/Is-the-US-manufacturing-the-Ebola-virus-with-HIV|title=Claims of US manufacturing Ebola with HIV go viral|author=Jean-Jacques Cornish|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa developed in 2014, a number of popular self-published and well-reviewed books containing sensational and misleading information about the disease appeared in electronic and printed formats. The authors of some such books admitted that they lacked medical credentials and were not technically qualified to give medical advice. The World Health Organization and the United Nations stated that such misinformation had contributed to the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/02/popular-on-amazon-wildly-misleading-self-published-books-about-ebola-by-random-people-without-medical-degrees/|title=Popular on Amazon: Wildly misleading self-published books about Ebola, by random people without medical degrees|date=2 October 2014|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Liberia, some body-collection teams dispatched to collect the Ebola dead have collected bribes to issue falsified death certificates to family members, stating that their dead relative did not die from Ebola. The body of the Ebola victim would also be left with relatives. Ebola carries a stigma in Liberia, and some families do not want to admit that their relative died of Ebola. Another factor is that families wish to give their relative a traditional burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-ebola-stricken-african-families-pay-bribes-for-fake-death-records-1413153854|title=Some Ebola-Stricken African Families Pay Bribes for Fake Death Records|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|first=Heidi|last=Vogt|date=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late October 2014 it was reported that harassment of gay Liberians in Monrovia was occurring after some church leaders said that "God was angry with Liberians over corruption and immoral acts such as homosexuality, and that Ebola was a punishment".

There are a number of Ebola-themed jokes circulating in West Africa to spread awareness.&lt;ref name="Bloom20140827"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-27/tell-me-the-one-about-ebola-how-jokes-spread-awareness.html|title=Tell Me the One About Ebola: How Jokes Spread Awareness|publisher=Bloomberg|author1=Pauline Bax|author2=Makiko Kitamura|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 the Liberian Football Association made an announcement that all soccer related activities would be put on hold "''indefinitely to protect players and fans''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28542577|title=Ebola outbreak: Liberia suspends football|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, in a joint venture between [[FIFA]] and [[WHO]], the [[Antoinette Tubman Stadium]] was converted into an Ebola treatment center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-12/monrovia-soccer-stadium-to-house-ebola-centre-fifa/5738710|title=Ebola outbreak: Soccer stadium in Liberia to be converted to virus treatment centre, FIFA says|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 [[African Cup of Nations]] (AFCON) was temporarily put on hold when the original hosts, [[Morocco]], asked the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) to postpone the final games till 2016, due to the Ebola outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30004279|title=Africa Cup of Nations: Morocco will not host finals over Ebola fears|publisher=BBC|date=11 November 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAF eventually moved the finals to [[Equatorial Guinea]], which eliminated Morocco from the game as hosts, and brought Equatorial Guinea in, even though they had been eliminated prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30053859|title=2015 Nations Cup: Equatorial Guinea to host tournament|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the qualifiers for 2015 AFCON have been influenced by many countries' fear of Ebola, with many refusing to enter or allow entry of teams from affected countries. In July 2014, [[Seychelles]] refused entry to the Sierra Leone team. CAF ruled that Seychelles forfeited the game, giving Sierra Leone an automatic pass to the next stage. [[Lesotho]] refused to send the [[African Youth Championship|Under-20]] team to [[Nigeria]]. CAF again ruled that Lesotho forfeited the game, sending Nigeria through to the finals.&lt;ref name="f24201408"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20140824-african-football-struggles-play-amid-ebola-outbreak-cup-of-nations/|title=African football in disarray amid Ebola outbreak|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, CAF also decided to forbid any official games in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. For Liberia, who had already been eliminated, this was not of concern.&lt;ref name="f24201408" /&gt; Sierra Leone managed to move some home games to the visiting teams home; both home and away games against [[DR Congo]] were played in [[Lubumbashi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28995543|title=Sierra Leone move Afcon tie with DR Congo to Lubumbashi|publisher=BBC|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|date=30 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both games against [[Cameroon]] were played in [[Yaounde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29330276|title=Nations Cup 2015: Cameroon and Sierra Leone find venues|publisher=BBC|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea managed to get their home games moved to [[Casablanca]], Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28844477|title=Guinea move Togo 2015 Nations Cup qualifier to Morocco|publisher=BBC|date=18 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after calls to have the 2015 AFCON postponed, the Equatorial Guinea government and CAF organisers have downplayed these concerns, and insisted that they would have ample measures in place, including: {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

On 7 August 2014 a social media hoax message was doing the rounds in [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa#Nigeria|Nigeria]]. It urged readers to "''bath with hot water and salt before daybreak''" and to drink as much of it as possible.

In two separate incidents in October, flights have been delayed from disembarking because of an Ebola joke. On 8 October 2014, [[US Airways]] flight 845 from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Punta Cana]], [[Dominican Republic]] was held up for two hours on the tarmac when an American passenger sneezed, then announced "I have Ebola. You're all screwed," during the flight. After landing, he was escorted off the plane by four emergency personnel wearing blue [[hazmat suit]]s, and detained until medical tests cleared him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/10/10/355108686/ebola-joke-triggers-passengers-removal-from-us-airways-flight|title=Ebola Joke Triggers Passenger's Removal From US Airways Flight|publisher=NPR|first=Scott|last=Neuman|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2787292/Hazmat-team-rushed-meet-US-plane-Dominican-Republic-passenger-sneezed-yelled-I-Ebola-poor-taste-joke.html|title=What NOT to say on a plane: American passenger bundled off U.S. to Dominican Republic flight by hazmat team after sneezing and joking 'I have Ebola!'|publisher=Daily Mail|author=Mia De Graaf|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2014, during the [[Aer Lingus]] flight EI 433, from [[Milan]], [[Italy]] to [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] a passenger wrote "'Attenzione Ebola'" ("Attention Ebola") on a coffee lid before handing it to his daughter.

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

[[File:Post-and-Grant-Avenue-Look.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], remembered as one of the worst [[natural disaster]]s in the history of the [[United States]].]]

A '''disaster''' is a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.&lt;ref name="ifrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=What is a disaster?|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/|website=www.ifrc.org|publisher=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHA"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=March 2002 |title=Disasters &amp; Emergencies: Definitions |url=http://apps.who.int/disasters/repo/7656.pdf |language=en-GB-oxendict|location=[[Addis Ababa]]|publisher=Emergency Humanitarian Action |access-date=2017-11-26 |via=World Health Organization International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately [[risk management|managed risk]]. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.&lt;ref name=quarantelli&gt;Quarantelli E.L. (editor) "Where We Have Been and Where We Might Go", ''What is a Disaster?: A Dozen Perspectives on the Question'', London, Routledge, 1 edition 1998, pp.146–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits&amp;nbsp;– more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of [[GDP]]) in [[developing countries]] than in [[industrialized countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTDISMGMT/0,,menuPK:341021~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:341015,00.html|title= World Bank: Disaster Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. [http://54pesos.org/2008/10/04/who%e2%80%99s-getting-the-worst-of-natural-disasters/ "Who’s getting the worst of natural disasters?"] 54Pesos.org, 4 October 2008  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903043315/http://54pesos.org/2008/10/04/who%E2%80%99s-getting-the-worst-of-natural-disasters |date=3 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''disaster'' is derived from Middle [[French language|French]] ''désastre'' and that from Old [[Italian language|Italian]] ''disastro'', which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[pejorative]] prefix δυσ-, (''dus-'') "bad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328613|title= Dus, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀστήρ (''aster''), "star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2316528|title= Aster, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word ''disaster'' ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an [[astrology|astrological]] sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=disaster "Disaster"] in Etymology online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
Researchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years [[disaster research]]. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.&lt;ref name=atrisk&gt;Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis &amp; Ben Wisner. ''At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters'', Wiltshire: Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in [[developing country|developing countries]]. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]].

===Natural disaster===
{{Main article| Natural disaster}}

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]], floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[Landform|landforms]], coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]]. [[Asia]] tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.
[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]

===Man-made disasters===
{{Main article|Anthropogenic hazard}}
Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened—for instance, terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event.

A '''disaster area''' is a region or a locale, heavily damaged by either natural, technological or social hazards. Disaster areas affect the population living in the community by dramatic increase in expense, loss of energy, food and services; and finally increase the risk of disease for citizens. An area that has been struck with a natural, technological or sociological hazard that opens the affected area for national or international aid.

==Natural hazard==
A natural hazard is a negative process of phenomena created naturally (tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes) that will affect people or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/GeographyVocabularyGCSEFarming.htm |title=Geography vocabulary: Gcse farming|year=February 2012|website=www.geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tornadoes===
'''[[Tornado]]es''' are narrow aggressively rotating mixtures of air that come from the base of a thunderstorm, being the most violent of storms. Tornadoes are usually hard to see unless they form a condensations funnel made from:- dust, water droplets and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSSL: Severe Weather 101: Tornadoes. NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes take place in several parts of the world, such as Australia, Europe, Africa but mostly occur in the United States, Argentina, and Bangladesh.

===Hurricanes===
[[File:Hurricane Sandy Flooding Avenue C 2012.JPG|thumbnail| New York City after the destruction of [[Hurricane Sandy]]]]

'''[[Hurricane]]s''', [[cyclones]], [[tropical storms]] and [[typhoons]] can be referred to as the same. They combine low pressure and strong winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Tropical cyclones have a low pressure center, rain and strong winds. They usually initiate over tropical or subtropical waters. Hurricanes can be predicted several days before they hit and can be very destructive and destroy homes and some other buildings. Cyclones, although they are the same type of storm, are harder to predict before a few days like hurricanes thus giving people only a few hours of notice to evacuate their homes. In this case there are far more deaths from flooding and high tides. A recent (2012) example of a hurricane is [[Hurricane Sandy]], which was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States, leaving millions without power and a few homeless.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=October 30, 2012|title= Sandy death toll rises, millions without power in u.s|via= CBC News|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/10/30/us-hurricane-sandy-superstorm-damages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
'''Floods''' take place when water overflows or submerges land that is usually parched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floods |work=[[IFRC]] |date=November 5, 2012|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/definition-of-hazard/floods/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common way is when rivers or streams overflow their banks. A floodplain is produced when water from a rivers spreads through the land from excessive rain, rapid ice melting, unfortunately placed beaver dam, and ruptured dam. There are two types of floods: general and flash floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Information, Flooding Facts, Flash Floods, Photos -- National Geographic. Environment Facts, Environment Science, Global Warming, Natural Disasters, Ecosystems, Green Living |website= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date= November 5, 2012|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/floods-profile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; General floods are predicted well in advance and usually cause the destruction of housing, people and crops. Flash floods come without warning and are sudden and extreme: A large volume of water flows rapidly and people have to make quick movements if they do not want to be caught in the flood. They have to find high safe ground where the water will not reach them.

===Earthquakes===
When two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past each other in the fault of the earth, it is called an earthquake. Energy released in many forms moves in all directions and causes the ground to shake.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|title= Seismic Sources – Earthquakes, Nuclear Blasts, Mining Events|work= Canada's Natural Resources|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/info-gen/faq-eng.php#where}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes earthquakes may have foreshocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same region which is followed by a larger earthquake. The larger earthquake, called the mainshock, always has aftershocks that follow it. Aftershocks can continue of hours, weeks, months and sometimes even years depending on how big the mainshock was. Earthquakes usually occur on active faults which define major tectonic plates on the Earth. 90% of the world’s earthquakes occur along plate boundaries.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt; Earthquakes can cause much damage, mainly from the ground shaking and leaving cracks in the ground. Sometimes it can also cause buildings to collapse and cause deaths.

==Technological hazards==
===Technical hazards===

[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Fukushima I [[Nuclear Power Plant]] after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Reactor 1 to 4 from left to right.]]
There are several technical hazards one should be aware of as they pose a threat humans and their values. These hazards are measured in terms of the risk they pose to the community using them. Technical hazards are classified by a source, specifically speaking; they can fall under automotive emissions, medical radiation, explosions and air pollution (environmental) hazards. The quality of the hazard determines the safety precautions that are taken. For example, hazards can be a risk to an individual or a risk to the population. If the population is at risk with the hazard, there will be more priorities for the management of the hazardous material. These hazardous materials can cause illness or even death to an individual if they are not address accordingly, so it is crucial for them to inform the public about these technical hazards.

===Nuclear and radiation (accidents/incidents)===
There are several thoughts that come to mind when one thinks of the word “nuclear”,&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url=http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf}} {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}	&lt;/ref&gt; whether it be basic chemistry or highly complex explosives; nuclear accidents, nuclear incidences or nuclear terrorism are definitely a threat to the community or the world in that matter. But what is nuclear terrorism exactly? A "nuclear accident, incident, or act of terrorism is an unpredictable, unusual and unwanted event involving radiation and/or radioactive materials."&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt; To specifically distinguish between the three, nuclear accidents are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. Nuclear incidents on the other hand are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt;

===Nuclear accident===
'''Nuclear accidents''' are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. There are several examples of these nuclear accidents taken place around the world. To start off, a prime example of a [[nuclear accident]] would be [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|Palo mares B-52 Accident]]. On January 17, 1966, a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[B-52]] [[bomber]] collided with a mid-tanker airplane that was being refueled at 31000 feet. When the two airplanes collided, the tanker airplane exploded completely killing all crew members, while the B-52 bomber split in half killing a small proportion of the crew. When the airplane split in half, four bombs dropped from the sky. Two of them detonated, causing 2 kilometers of land to be contaminated by radioactive plutonium. The fourth explosive was recovered when it was discovered that it landed on the sea. The soil on the contaminated area had to be removed and placed in barrels, to reduce the amount of pollution having been caused by the nuclear explosive.

===Nuclear incident===
'''Nuclear incidents''' are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url= http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Secondary example would be the Johnston Atoll Incident that occurred on July 25, 1962. They decided to conduct the experiment at Christmas Island on Johnson Atoll, where they set off 36 nuclear explosions. One of the missile launches went wrong as it malfunctioned when trying to launch. The leaders decided to detonate the missile before it launched. When it detonated, the entire island was covered with radioactive plutonium. The witnesses claimed that 85% of the people suffered from [[radioactive contamination]] that created cancer and other radioactive related diseases. Plus those who were present at the site of the explosion suffered from infertility, and other body deformations.

==Sociological hazards==
Sociological hazards that create a disaster area are [[riots]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].

===Riot===
A riot is defined as a noisy, violent public disturbance caused by  a group or a crowd (three or more people) usually protesting against another group or government policy in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riot -  Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=November 1, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/riot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK London riot in August 2011, for example, was started due to the shooting of [[Mark Duggan]] by the London police.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuchs|first= C. |year=2012|title= Behind the News: Social Media, Riots and Revolution. Capital and Class, 36(3), 383-391|accessdate=November 1, 2012 |url=http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/36/3/383.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters came together destroying neighborhoods and streets violently damaging property to protest the police's actions that happened a few days prior.&lt;ref name="Fuchs" /&gt; Riots increase expenses to repair costly damages putting the city in distress.

===Terrorism===
[[File:North face south tower after plane strike 9-11.jpg|thumb|[[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] burning down during the [[9/11 attacks]].]]

Terrorism is defined as acts of violence and threats by a group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/terrorism|title=terrorism|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorism occurs with an unexpected attack on [[non-combatants]] to create fear and panic having a detrimental consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorism. The American Heritage: New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition|date= November 5, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrorist attacks]] create a massive, costly impact on the society. Not only is there large amount of property damage that may not be able to be repaired, there is also a large impact on citizens. People lose loved ones and suffer from their own health being impacted. The [[9/11|9/11 terrorist attack]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|twin towers]] in [[New York City]] marks one of the largest attacks on the United States.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1= H.|last2= Keenan|first2= K. |year=2012|title= The Impact of 9/11 on the Geography of Financial Services in New York. The Professional Geographer, 64(3), 370-388|accessdate=November 4, 2012|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Twin Towers were completely destroyed, damaging the surrounding buildings as well as causing the loss of many lives. People suffered from health problems from inhaling the sediments from the crumbling towers. The financial and social impact is still present thirteen years later in today's society.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; It is concluded that New York City still suffers from a post-disaster decline in financial services.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; New York City is a Disaster area due to the sociological hazard of terrorism.

===War===
War defined as a period where conflict is carried out as an act of hostility by [[armed forces]] between two or more nations or [[Civil war|within a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/war war]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan, for example would be a sociological hazard causing disaster areas because it is considered a war zone. There has been an ongoing battle between United States and the Taliban in Afghanistan resulting in a war zone.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first= M. |year=2011|title=They were Hunting and Killing Us: Abc News' Mike Boettcher Caught in Taliban Firefight with U.S. Troops in Afghanistan|work= ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/abc-news-mike-boettcher-caught-taliban-firefight-us/story?id=13702376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant bombing and shooting marks up Afghanistan destructing property, land and causing threats to the civilians living in the area.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; Thousands have died and international aid for the cost of the war is implemented through tax payers.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; There is lack of resources due to the war area cutting off access to areas because of violence and danger.

==Examples of modern disaster areas==
An example of a '''technological disaster''' was the Fukushima disaster which was caused by a “massive 8.9-magnitude earthquake [that] hit northeast Japan”.&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worst Nuclear Accidents / Disasters in History|year=2011| accessdate=November 5, 2012|url= http://www.smashinglists.com/worst-nuclear-accidents-disasters-in-history/|website=www.smashinglists.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This earthquake caused a [[nuclear explosion]] at a power plant; five reactors were damaged, causing the plant to go into an emergency state. All this occurred because there was a technological error in the system that cut down the regular and emergency power, causing the five reactors to destabilize and explode. This significant nuclear event had a big impact on the public health, as the area suffered nuclear contamination. The contamination caused all the crops such as milk, water or vegetables unsafe to eat. Hence all food grown in that area was banned from being sold. People in the “surroundings were moved to safe shelters,”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt; and 3 people were affected by the radiation alone. Luckily, the “Japanese government [handled] the situation in the most efficient and amazing way that anyone can imagine.”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt;

A recent example of a disaster area caused by a '''natural hazard''' is [[Hurricane Sandy]] which hit October 27, 2012. It was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States. The storm killed about 50 people and many were also hit by falling trees. The hardest-hit state was New York, leaving millions without power and a few homeless. 

A disaster area caused by a '''sociological hazard''' would be the terrorist attack on [[September 11th, 2001]], in New York City. Two airplanes struck the Twin Towers, causing them to crumble, killing many people in the process.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masud|first= E. |year=2006|title= What Really Happened on September 11 Remains a Mystery |work=The Wisdom Fund|accessdate= November 5, 2012 |url=http://www.twf.org/News/Y2002/0427-Mystery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected attack harmed many people and had a detrimental impact on New York City.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A '''false ending''' has two contexts: in literature, film and video games it is a narrative device where the plot seems to be heading to its conclusion, but in reality, there's still more to the story; in a musical composition, however, it is a complete stop of the work or song for one or more seconds before continuing.

The presence of a false ending can be anticipated through a number of ways: the medium itself might betray that it isn't the true ending (i.e. it's only halfway into a book or a song, a film's listed running time hasn't fully elapsed, only half the world has been explored in a video game, etc.), making only stories with indeterminate running length or a multi-story structure able to pull this off effectively; another indicator is the feeling that too much of the story is incomplete when the false ending comes, making it feel like there has to be more.

==Film==

In ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' , it seems like the criminal case that the movie revolves around is completely closed with no loose ends until one of the witnesses admits that she lied about important details to give more importance towards the trial of the people who raped her, exposing a cover-up conspiracy. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', the director keeps using editing techniques that are indicative of endings in scenes that could be used as such, but continues until the movie finally ends. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' has two false endings. Another example is in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', where, at a very climatic stage in the film, the screen fades away and says ''[[Cliffhanger|To be continued]]'', which is then followed by the word "Immediately."

Some movies come to a formal ending, followed by the rolling of the credits, which is almost universally used to indicate that the film has ended, only to have the actors reappear in one or more [[mid-credits scene]]s. In comedy films, these sequences may be [[blooper]]s or [[outtake]]s. In other types of films, the mid-credit scenes may continue the narrative set out in the movie. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] movies have become notorious for this, in some cases featuring a mid-credits scene and an end-credits scene in the same movie.

In the police comedy ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007), two police officers realize that a cult is controlling their town. After the two officers defeat the head of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance and his members, who have been causing problems in the town, the pair are celebrating their success at the police station, and the movie appears to be wrapping up. Then a surviving member of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance enters the station and shoots an old musket, which triggers an old-fashioned mine.

==Television==

==Video games==
Some examples in video games include ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' and ''[[Wild ARMs]]''. Both involve confrontations with the major antagonists at what seems like their final lairs, but instead a crisis occurs and the story continues. A third is in ''[[Naval Ops: Warship Gunner]]'', upon sinking the ''Druna Skass'' a second time (Which can only happen if the player plays though the game again, as the game resets itself to the beginning if you sink it once), the player is greeted by another supership, that looks just like the ''Druna Skass''. Yet another example is the [[survival horror]] game ''[[Obscure II]]'', in which the player must wait until the credits roll to their conclusion before gameplay resumes.

[[Role-playing video game]]s are notorious for having such plot devices. It usually involves the game's main antagonist being defeated, only for a previously mentioned character to be revealed as the "real" villain. One example is ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', in which the main character is apparently about to have a boss fight with the former villain Zant, but Zant reveals he has been working for another Villain.
Another example is "[[Kid Icarus: Uprising]]" where after you defeat Medusa, credits roll but are quickly interrupted by Hades, the villain for the rest of the game.

In video games, it is difficult to use the false ending device effectively. Nevertheless, in the hands of a skilled designer, there are several methods that allow it to be done. In several video games, such as those with multiple playable characters and story lines, the game may appear to end after defeating a difficult boss, or clearing what appears to be the "Final" level, complete with credits, an [[Closing credits|outro]], and a return to the start screen. These endings are different from bad endings, as everything may appear to be resolved. However, fulfilling conditions such as clearing all the storylines, reloading the save file, or reaching the "ending" in a [[New Game+]] mode may give the player the option to continue on to the real ending.

An example of this is ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', and its sequel ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. In the former, while there are six stories to play, only the main character's, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character) | Sonic's]] is the most complete. The other characters' stories are simply side-stories. However, if "all" of the stories are completed, a final story appears that wraps up the game and acts as the "true" ending. In the latter, there are two stories to play, one for the heroes, and one for the villains. Of note is the plot device is hidden in a false [[Chaos Emerald]] being used that would destroy the space colony in which the villain [[Doctor Eggman]] is using as a base. It is at first implied that Eggman took the false Emerald, but in reality, when the last story is played, again, after the two normal stories are completed, a true conclusion is offered.

Another example could be the survival horror game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', where, depending on your choice, you get to play with one of the two characters and get a certain ending for one of them to later discover, when you finish playing the second path with the second character, you fight the real final boss and the "true" ending (That may vary depending of which character you have chosen first) is shown. The main difference between both of the "true" endings are that places and times are exchanged, as well as the final dialogue from the game.

''The Consequence'', the second Kidman DLC for 2014's ''[[The Evil Within]]'', features a secret false ending in a similar manner to those shown in the ''Resident Evil'' franchise. At one point, Juli Kidman encounters the brain of the game's main antagonist, Ruben Victoriano, sealed [[Brain in a jar|inside a glass container]] hooked up to the STEM system in Beacon Hospital. Should the player choose to shoot the container and break it, the game cuts to black, then begins the credits sequence, cutting short on a postcard depicting Juli, Joseph and Sebastian on a postcard, before promptly returning to the game as Kidman exclaims "What the fuck?!", indicating the whole sequence was a hallucination.

==Music==
False endings are a known device in classical music. [[Josef Haydn]] was fond of them, for example inducing applause at the wrong place in the finales of his [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Fourth_movement|String Quartet, Op. 33 No. 2]] (nicknamed "The Joke")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/may/29/haydn-playful-composer-tom-service |title=Haydn composed existential comedy |first=Tom |last=Service |authorlink=Tom Service |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Symphony No. 90 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 90]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sarahhicksconductor.com/web/buzz_details.aspx?ItemId=554184 |title= Haydn’s Head Fake |date=16 May 2010 |first=Sarah |last=Hicks |authorlink=Sarah Hicks |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement of [[Prokoviev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] contains false endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/composition/4176 |title=Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 25, "Classical" |first=Richard |last=Rodda |website=[[Kennedy Center]] |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
In music, a number of [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[song]]s use false endings in which the music is arranged so that the song appears to be coming to its ending (e.g., reaching a final [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] on the [[tonic (music)|chord of the home key]] and then stopping), but then the music recommences. Examples include [[The Rascals]]' "[[Good Lovin']]"; [[The Four Tops]]' "[[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]", "[[White Room]]" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]; "[[The Peace!]]" by [[Morning Musume]]; "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]]; "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]" by [[The Beatles]]; "[[Monday, Monday]]" by [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]; and "[[But You Know I Love You]]" by [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]. Another notable example of a musical false ending is "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]" by [[Bryan Adams]] - because the original song was six and a half minutes long, the false ending became the end of the single/video edit of the song (the album version had a fadeout ending).

In addition, several other songs have also had false endings, such as "[[Angels (Amy Grant song)|Angels]]" by [[Amy Grant]], a #1 Christian hit in 1984. Another example is "[[Keep on Dancing (The Gentrys song)|Keep On Dancing]]", a 1965 Top 10 hit for the group [[The Gentrys]] from Memphis, Tennessee. In both songs, there is a pause of two seconds before the music starts all over again. Also, "[[When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)]]" by [[The Beach Boys]], has a sudden stop and resumes 1 second later as the band counts numbers of years of age until the song fades, counting from 19 to 30. The [[Alice in Chains]] track "Rain When I Die" has a fade-out false ending lasting about 20 seconds, then the music comes back, and then it fades once more, thus providing the real ending. "[[Weather with You]]" by [[Crowded House]] appears to be ending and then another small instrumental is followed by a final chorus.

'''Foreign body aspiration''' occurs when a foreign body enters the airways and causes [[choking]].&lt;ref name="urlForeign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview |title=Foreign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects can enter the esophagus through the mouth, or enter the trachea through the mouth or nose.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Pediatrics, 24e, "Respiratory Tract &amp; Mediastinum"|last=Federico|first=Monica|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=1259862909|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Most cases of foreign body aspiration are in children ages 6 months to 3 years due to the tendency for children to place small objects in the mouth and nose. Children of this age usually lack molars and cannot grind up food into small pieces for proper swallowing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Surgery, 14e, "Otolaryngology: Head &amp; Neck Surgery"|last=Weinberger|first=Paul|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2015|isbn=9781259255168|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, round objects including nuts, hard candy, popcorn kernels, beans, and berries are common causes of foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Latex balloons are also a serious choking hazard in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the [[Heimlich maneuver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muntz|first=Harlan|title=Pediatric Otolaryngology for the Clinician: Foreign Body Management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-58829-542-2|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adults, foreign body aspiration is most prevalent in populations with impaired swallowing mechanisms such as the following: neurological disorders, alcohol use, sedative use, advanced age (most common in the 6th decade of life), and loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders, Fifth Edition, "Upper Airway Obstruction in Adults"|last=Won|first=Christine|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2015|isbn=0071807284|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Signs and Symptoms ==
[[File:Foreign body aspiration.jpg|thumb|foreign body aspiration]]
Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration vary based on the site of obstruction, the size of the foreign body, and the severity of obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 20% of foreign bodies become lodged in the upper airway, while 80% become lodged in the mainstem or lobar bronchus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Emergency Medicine, 8e, "Respiratory Distress"|last=Lucia|first=Dominic|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2017|isbn=0071840613|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs of foreign body aspiration are usually abrupt in onset with coughing, choking, and/or wheezing; however, symptoms can be more progressive if the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction of the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Classically, patients present with acute onset of choking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these cases, the obstruction is classified as a partial or complete obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Signs of partial obstruction include choking with drooling, stridor, and the ability to speak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Signs of complete obstruction include choking with inability to speak or cough, and signs of respiratory distress such as cyanosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Foreign bodies above the larynx often present with stridor, while objects below the larynx present with wheezing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Foreign bodies above the vocal cords often present with difficulty and pain with swallowing and excessive drooling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Foreign bodies below the vocal cords often present with pain and difficulty with speaking and breathing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Increased respiratory rate may be the only sign of foreign body aspiration in a child who cannot verbalize or report if they have swallowed a foreign body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction, patients may present with chronic cough, asymmetrical breath sounds on exam, or recurrent pneumonia of a specific lung lobe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The right lower lobe of the lung is the most common site of recurrent pneumonia in foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is due to the fact that the anatomy of the right main bronchus is wider and steeper than that of the left main bronchus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration in adults can sometimes mimic other lung disorders such as asthma, COPD, and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Medical Diagnosis &amp; Treatment, "Pulmonary Disorders"|last=Chesnutt|first=Asha|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2019|isbn=126011743X|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Diagnosis ==
If foreign body aspiration is suspected, finger sweeping in the oral cavity is not recommended due to the increased risk of displacing the foreign object further into the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Most patients receive a chest x-ray to determine the location of the foreign body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a negative chest x-ray cannot rule out foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lateral neck, chest, and bilateral decubitus end-expiratory chest x-rays should be obtained in patients suspected of having aspirated a foreign body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Signs on x-ray that can be indicative of foreign body aspiration include visualization of the foreign body or hyperinflation of the affected lung.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other x-ray findings that can be seen with foreign body aspiration include obstructive emphysema, atelectasis, and consolidation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While, x-ray can be used to visualize the location and identity of a foreign body, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is the gold-standard for diagnosis since the foreign body can be visualized and removed with this intervention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rigid bronchoscopy is indicated when two of the three following criteria are met: report of foreign body aspiration by the patient or a witness, abnormal lung exam findings, or abnormal chest x-ray findings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Treatment ==
Treatment of foreign body aspiration is determined by the severity of obstruction of the airway involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In partial obstruction, the patient can usually clear the foreign body with coughing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In complete obstruction, acute intervention is required to remove the foreign body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For choking children less than 1 year of age, the child should be placed face down over the rescuer's arm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Back blows should be delivered with the heel of the hand, then the patient should be turned face-up and chest thrusts should be administered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rescuer should alternate five back blows followed by five chest thrusts until the object is cleared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Heimlich maneuver should be used in choking patients older than 1 year of age to dislodge a foreign body. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the patient becomes unresponsive during physical intervention, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the event that the above measures do not remove the foreign body, and adequate ventilation cannot be restored, need for treatment by trained personnel becomes necessary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Laryngoscopy should be performed in unresponsive patients if non-invasive airway clearance techniques are unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Laryngoscopy involves placing a device in the mouth to visualize the back of the airway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign body can be seen, it can be removed with forceps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An endotracheal tube should then be placed in order to prevent airway compromise from resulting inflammation after the procedure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign body cannot be visualized, intubation, tracheostomy, or needle cricothyrotomy can be done to restore an airway for patients who have become unresponsive due to airway compromise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

If non-invasive measures do not dislodge the foreign body, and the patient can maintain adequate ventilation, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia should be performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and a pulse oximeter should be applied to the patient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Efforts should be made to keep the patient calm and avoid agitating the patient to prevent further airway compromise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the foreign body is removed, patients should receive nebulized beta-adrenergic medication and chest physiotherapy to further protect the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Complications ==
Many complications can develop after a foreign body is removed, or if a foreign body remains in the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patients may develop inflammation of the airway walls or lung abscess from a foreign body remaining in the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hyperinflation of the airway distal to the obstruction can also occur if the foreign body is not removed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Patients can also develop pneumonia from retained foreign bodies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Episodes of recurrent pneumonia in the same lung field should prompt evaluation for a possible foreign body in the airway.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even if the foreign body is removed, complications such as chemical bronchitis, mucosal reactions, and the development of granulation tissue are possible.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Game2: Winter''''' ({{lang-ru|Гаме2Винтер|italic=yes}}) was a social experiment and media stunt promoted as a [[Russia]]n survival [[reality television]] program produced by [[Novosibirsk]] entrepreneur [[Yevgeny Pyatkovsky]] that was set to premiere in {{date|July 2017}}.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/15/russian-reality-tv-show-allow-rape-murder-game2-winter|title=Russian reality TV show Game2: Winter to 'allow' rape and murder in Siberia|last=Lee|first=Benjamin|date=2016-12-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show caught the attention of the press when the show stated that its rules would allow crimes such as rape and murder which sparked outrage online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://game2winter.ru/pravila|title=Правила Game2: Winter|work=Game2:Winter|access-date=2017-05-07|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/a-russian-reality-show-will-allow-murder-rape-anything-2016-12|title=A 'Hunger Games' style Russian reality show will allow 'murder, rape, anything'|work=Business Insider|last=Bulman|first=May|date=2016-12-16|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/sick-rules-for-new-russian-reality-tv-show-allow-contestants-to-fight-rape-and-murder-each-other/news-story/eb6a370c750cefc4e4e6de6e0fd3449f|title=Sick rules for new Russian reality TV show|last=Stewart|first=Will|date=2016-12-16|work=News.com.au|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has been compared to a "real-life ''[[Hunger Games]]''".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/03/09/a-real-life-hunger-games-is-coming-to-russia/|title=A real-life ‘Hunger Games’ is coming to Russia|last=Perez|first=Chris|date=2017-03-09|website=New York Post|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/38342421/russia-does-the-hunger-games-for-real-in-siberia-but-no-guns-are-allowed|title=Russia does the Hunger Games for real in Siberia but no guns are allowed|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|language=en-GB|date=2016-12-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
30 participants, half men and half women, were expected to compete on a remote Siberian island in the [[Ob River]] for a 100 million rouble ($1.7 million) prize on a nine month survival mission.
All contestants were said to have signed death waivers and agreed not to hold the organisers accountable for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siberian-real-life-hunger-games-will-not-stop-rape-murder-fight-1-7m-prize-1611060|title=Siberian real-life Hunger Games will 'not stop' rape or murder in fight for $1.7m prize|last=Taylor|first=Alex|date=2017-03-11|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We will refuse any claim of participants even if they were to be killed or raped. We will have nothing to do with this. This will be spelled out in a document to be signed by the participant before the start of the show.
We will not intervene into relations between participants nor monitor their sexual life either, and our cameras will not be able to follow every move in every corner of the island.|author=[[Yevgeny Pyatkovsky]], executive producer}}

However, [[Snopes]] found that 'Despite multiple misleading headlines, the waiver described by news outlets explicitly stated that contestants on the show would be obliged to "obey the laws of the Russian Federation".'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/russian-reality-show-game2-winter-allows-rape-murder/|title=Russian Reality Show ‘Game2: Winter’ Allows Rape, Murder?

The '''Great Escape Tour''' was the scheduled second headlining concert tour by Australian recording artist [[Iggy Azalea]] in support of her debut album, ''[[The New Classic]]'' (2014), its reissue, ''[[Reclassified]]'' (2014) and then-upcoming second studio album. The tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one cities across [[North America]] over the span of two months, beginning on 18 September 2015 in [[San Diego, California]] and concluding on 27 October 2015 in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. It was announced on 29 May 2015 that the entire tour was cancelled, with a new tour to be announced with her then-upcoming, later cancelled album in 2016.&lt;ref name="XXL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2015/05/iggy-azalea-cancels-tour/|title=Iggy Azalea Cancels Her Tour|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of Azalea's tours to be cancelled, with her 2018 Bad Girls Tour also later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/iggy-azalea-bad-girls-tour-canceled-1150078|title=Iggy Azalea Bad Girls Tour Canceled|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Jaime|first=Natalya|date=7 October 2018|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 10 December 2014, when reflecting on the year she has had and the struggles she faced in the years before, Azalea announced plans of an arena tour and a second studio album via her [[Twitter]] account. The same day, Azalea revealed the title of the tour and the concept behind it, which is Azalea picturing herself as "a musical escape artist for people." Azalea also revealed that the name of the tour goes along with the title of her upcoming second studio album, which will also be promoted on the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=Iggy Azalea's Planning Her 'Great Escape': Here's What She's Talking About|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2023011/iggy-azalea-announces-great-escape-tour/|work=[[MTV]]|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2014, the North American leg of the tour was officially announced. Presented by [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]], the first leg of tour, which was set to commence on 14 April 2015 in [[Fresno, California]], and was scheduled to visit twenty-four cities across North America during the spring of 2015 before ending on 24 May 2015 in [[Austin, Texas]]. Also revealed in the North American leg announcement was that [[Nick Jonas]] and [[Tinashe]] would be the special guests supporting Azalea on the first leg of the tour promoting their latest individual efforts, ''[[Nick Jonas (album)|Nick Jonas]]'' (2014) and ''[[Aquarius (Tinashe album)|Aquarius]]'' (2014). Azalea's [[disc jockey]], DJ Wizz Kidd, would also support Azalea throughout the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=Iggy Azalea Announces The Great Escape Tour Dates: See Them Here!|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2027204/iggy-azalea-great-escape-tour-nick-jonas/|work=[[MTV]]|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 15 December 2014, pre-sale tickets were available to all [[American Express]] cardholders through 18 December 2014. The public on-sale followed immediately after with tickets becoming available on 19 December 2014. Platinum and VIP Packages also became available for purchase on AEG's website, in which the packages included premium seating and exclusive autographed merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea Blazes a Trail For the Can’t-Miss The Great Escape Tour|url=http://www.aeglive.com/news/view/12284|work=[[Anschutz Entertainment Group]]|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'', Azalea began to reveal details about the tour's stage, visuals, and concept. When speaking about her main focus of the tour, Azalea stated "I want everything to be right—everything, from the tour book to what someone wears. Even the right faces for the dancers, and their attitude. Everything is equally important." While discussing stage layout, Azalea revealed that she's "trying to work on the initial stage design" and that she's "making a stage that [she can] engage with many people in an arena that big." She also noted that she was working with [[Jamie King]], who has also worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] on her [[Confessions Tour]] (2006), which Azalea has stated is a major influence for the tour. Other influences for the tour that she's mentioned include the films ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' (1980) and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940). In regards to the visuals, Azalea has stated that the tour will include "color blocking—loud, just obnoxious-type visual things", that she also characterized as "Trippy, cool, [and] colorful." Azalea also commented on the nature of the show by saying "The traditional hip-hop arena show is more focused on a DJ. I don't think it has as many props and spectacles as perhaps a pop show, which is also what I would say my show is visually like." Overall, Azalea has stated her desire for the show is "not to be too wacky" and to be "a great experience [in which fans feel] really immersed in the whole thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Sarah|title=Iggy Azalea Hopes She'll Still Be "Gyrating in a Leotard at 35"|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201502/iggy-azalea-interview-grammys|work=[[GQ]]|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The whole point was to make no compromises, but nothing's changed in terms of my creative vision," Azalea told the [[Associated Press]] on 18 March 2014, backstage at a show for [[Samsung Galaxy]] during [[South by Southwest|SXSW]]. "It's very kind of like [[Patrick Nagel]], powerful 80s androgynous women vibe." Azalea admitted not wanting to wait until September to launch the tour, "but because the arenas are so far in advanced booked, it was kind of their next slot." She also mentioned taking advantage of the free time to finish recording her second album, "I didn't anticipate having any time to completely finish it, but now that I have kind of the time, I'd love to have an album at the end of 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Iggy Azalea Talks 'Trouble,' Tour Postponement &amp; More with Michelle and Booker|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/iggy-azalea-social-media-tour-album-britney-spears-29746908|website=abcnews.go.com|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2015, Azalea told ''Billboard'' at the [[iHeartRadio Music Awards]], the tour was now under the creative guidance of a new production designer, Baz Halpin, who'd been seasoning the show with a post-apocalyptic vibe, "It's going to be maybe a bit like [[Blade Runner]], full of dark and '80s ridiculous fare but not in a cliché way," also revealing she had parted ways with former tour producer AEG Live over creative differences earlier that month. "It's been great working with a new person who really understands my vision," Azalea said of Halpin, who had also fashioned the set for her performance of "[[Trouble (Iggy Azalea song)|Trouble]]" with [[Jennifer Hudson]] both at the iHeartRadio Awards and [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] on the previous day. "It's taken some of the workload off me that he's able to understand what I'm trying to achieve instead of battling it, or it being lost in translation," Azalea continued. "Some things just work. With Baz, I really don't have to say it; he's thinking what I'm thinking, and it's great. I'm super-excited about the tour," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea Is Done 'Battling' for What She Wants on Tour|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6516964/iggy-azalea-tour-iheartradio-awards-interview|work=Billboard|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescheduling and cancellation==
On 10 March 2015, it was announced the tour was being rescheduled "due to tour production delays", according to a statement from Def Jam Recordings. After reports surfaced that the tour was to be cancelled due to lack of promotion and conflict between her and management, Def Jam announced the decision "to accommodate for creative team availability and tour productions, it was determined that the tour will not be ready this spring." They continued, "It's important to Iggy that she delivers the show she envisaged to share with her fans and that requires more time in development." The spring tour was rescheduled to the fall, kicking off on September 18 in San Diego, California. A rep for Azalea also added that "there's no truth to the rumor that there's any conflict between her and her management."&lt;ref name="bb2015"/&gt; The press release issued by AEG Live also noted tickets for dates on the tour would be valid for the new dates in the fall, with the exception of the Baltimore, Las Vegas and Sacramento shows being canceled altogether, also indicating that the opening acts for the spring tour, Nick Jonas and Tinashe, would be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varga|first=George|title=Iggy Azalea postpones her spring tour to fall|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/mar/10/iggy-azalea-reschedules-spring-tour-for-fall/|website=utsandiego.com|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the announcement, a message was also posted from Azalea's official Twitter account: "The tour getting pushed back only means that it'll be way more amazing than it would've been in April. Good things take time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boardman|first=Madeline|title=Iggy Azalea Postpones The Great Escape Tour, Pushes It Months Back|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/iggy-azalea-postpones-the-great-escape-tour-pushes-it-months-back-2015103|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2015, it was announced that the entire tour had been cancelled, with ticket holders receiving an email that stated "The Iggy Azalea Great Escape Tour scheduled for this fall has been cancelled and refunds are available at point of purchase. There will be a new tour planned around Iggy's new record to be released in 2016 and we apologize for any inconvenience."&lt;ref name="XXL"/&gt; Azalea stated, "I'm sad and sorry to let my fans down," confirming plans to "be back on the road when the next album is done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea apologises to fans for cancelling tour|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32943518/iggy-azalea-apologises-to-fans-for-cancelling-tour|work=bbc.co.uk|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later issued a statement clarifying the cancellation saying she "had a different creative change of heart," in addition to being unable to find new opening acts available for the new dates she thought that would be a good fit for the tour and announcing she would also be taking a break to figure out the progression she wanted for her sound and visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rizzo|first=Monica|title=Iggy Azalea Reveals Why She Canceled Her Upcoming Tour|url=http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31241/exclusive-iggy-azalea-on-why-she-canceled-her-upcoming-tour/|work=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour promoter, AEG Live's senior VP Debra Rathwell, stated they never put its full marketing support behind the tour, explaining, "As we were not able to fill the support slots on the tour in the fall, due to so many artists already having commitments and working this summer, we had not advertised or promoted the new shows since last winter." She added, "The dates were selling well and were going to do fine,” standing by Azalea’s creative decision to take a break and not exploring a move to smaller venues by clarifying, "there was no reason to do so. AEG LIVE is committed to her and will be working with her on her new tour." Azalea’s booking agency, CAA, also issued a statement, "The lines of communication between Iggy, myself, and her [Turn First] managers Sarah [Stennett] and Nadia [Khan] have always been open. Iggy is an incredibly talented and creative artist with a clear vision, which she continuously shares with myself and her management team."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boardman|first=Madeline|title=Iggy Azalea Tour Cancellation Explained by AEG's Debra Rathwell &amp; CAA's Cara Lewis: Exclusive|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6590031/iggy-azalea-tour-cancellation-aeg-caa-explanation|work=Billboard|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial performance==
After the tickets for the tour became available to the public for purchase on 19 December 2014, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported positive news for ticket sales on the primary and secondary markets. On 7 January 2015, a list compiled by [[TiqIQ]] revealed that tickets for Azalea's tour were ranked fourteenth for most expensive concert tickets of the year as of that month. On the secondary market, the average ticket price for Azalea's tour totals in about $167, therefore making the tickets some of the most expensive tickets available on the secondary market. Ticket prices for the tour managed to top artists such as the [[Foo Fighters]], but paled in comparison to artists such as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Maroon 5]], and [[Taylor Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|title=Top 15 2015 Concert Tours at the Ticket Booth|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/fjlg45mhfj/14-iggy-azalea-nick-jonas-the-great-escape-tour-avg-price-167-19/|work=[[Forbes]]|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

The campaign resulted in a resolution by the [[United States Senate]] and contributed to the decision to send troops by the [[African Union]]. The film also called for an April 20 world wide canvassing campaign, called "Cover the Night". On April 5, 2012, Invisible Children released a follow-up video, titled ''[[#Kony 2012 Part II|Kony 2012: Part II&amp;nbsp;– Beyond Famous]]'', which failed to repeat the success of the original.

==''Kony 2012''==
The film documents the [[Invisible Children, Inc.|Invisible Children]]'s plans and efforts to capture [[Joseph Kony]]. It describes Kony's actions with his rebel militia group [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA), including [[Impressment|forced recruitment]] of [[child soldiers]], and the regions (northern [[Uganda]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[South Sudan]]) in which they have been active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altoona.psu.edu/now/news.php?value=3646 |title=KONY 2012, an Invisible Children film, to show on campus March 12 |accessdate=March 7, 2012 |date=March 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Penn State Altoona]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310034444/http://www.altoona.psu.edu/now/news.php?value=3646 |archivedate=March 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main people featured in the film is a young Ugandan named Jacob Avaye, whose brother was killed by the LRA. In response, director and founder of Invisible Children, [[Jason Russell]], promises Jacob that he will help "stop Kony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebs Help 'Stop Kony' Trend on Twitter: Who Is Kony? |author=Jenny McGrath |url=http://www.wetpaint.com/network/articles/celebs-help-stop-kony-tweet-on-twitter-who-is-kony |newspaper=[[Wetpaint]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film advocates the restoration of social order and curtailing compelled and coerced [[Military use of children|youth military service]].&lt;ref name=JCTSK/&gt; The video also has clips of Jason Russell's young son reacting to the information about Kony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cunningham |first=Todd |url=http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/kony-2012-part-ii-beyond-famous-takes-warlord-and-critics-36822 |title='Kony 2012: Part II - Beyond Famous' Takes on Warlord and Critics |publisher=Thewrap.com |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the film, a 2011 announcement from U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] is shown authorizing the deployment of 100 [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] military advisers to provide "information, advice, and assistance to partner nation forces" of [[Central Africa]]n countries to "remove Joseph Kony from the battlefield".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uganda: Obama Sends U.S. Military Advisers to Help Track LRA's Kony |author=Jim Lobe |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201110150156.html |newspaper=[[AllAfrica]] |date=October 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video concludes by urging viewers to join its publicity campaign by putting up posters and helping out in their communities.&lt;ref name=YouTube&gt;{{cite video|year=2012 |title=KONY 2012 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc |medium=Motion picture |publisher=Invisible Children |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invisible Children==
The Invisible Children charity has focused on obtaining the support of a select group of individuals in order to "help bring awareness to the abuse and killing of children in the [[East Africa|East]] and Central African countries at the hands of Kony and his leadership." This list included 20 "celebrity culture makers", such as [[George Clooney]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] (who significantly helped to spread the video&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;), [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Ryan Seacrest]].&lt;ref name="E!"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012: George Clooney, Angelina Jolie and You Asked to Save Africa's Invisible Children From Torture |author=Rebecca Macatee |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/kony_2012_george_clooney_angelina_jolie/299424 |publisher=[[E!]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Basulto |first=Dominic |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/clooney-kony-soldiers-spy-satellites-celebrity-philanthropy-goes-high-tech/2012/03/30/gIQADM0MlS_blog.html |title=Clooney, Kony, soldier, spy: Celebrity activism goes high-tech&amp;nbsp;– Ideas@Innovations |work=The Washington Post |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list also featured 12 "policy makers" that have "the power to keep U.S. government officials in Africa" in order to work toward the capture of Kony. This list includes former U.S. President [[George W.

===Cover the Night===
[[File:Kony 2012 Posters in Washington, DC.JPG|thumb|left|Kony 2012 posters on fence on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

As part of the campaign, American supporters were asked to put up posters in their hometowns in an action named "Cover the Night", which took place on April 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Harris in New York |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/13/kony-2012-invisble-children-day-of-action |title=Kony 2012 organisers plan massive day of action across US cities |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invisible Children website offers posters and T-shirts in an attempt to gain wider recognition. They also created action kits to help spread awareness that include campaign buttons, posters, bracelets and stickers.&lt;ref name="Lees0307"/&gt;

The "Cover the Night" event took place worldwide on April 20, 2012, and was to be conducted by supporters who were encouraged to perform some sort of charity work that morning in their local community. Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign.

=== Social Media Response ===
After the video was released, various social media outlets went into a frenzy and exploded the Kony 2012 movement into the world-wide news.  The video, directed by [[Jason Russell]], began to generate a tremendous amount of social media attention.  After being the quickest video to reach 100 million views within 6 days,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kony 2012 took over social media with hashtags like #Kony2012. The social media impact was so relevant that, on March 6 and 7, more people were talking about Kony 2012 through Facebook posts than the newly released Apple iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.notothequo.com/kony-2012-social-media-case-study-stats-and-insights/|title=Kony 2012 Social Media Case Study {{!}} Stats and Insights - N2Q Consulting|date=2012-03-08|work=N2Q Consulting|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Facebook]], nearly 66% of Twitter conversations during March 5&amp;nbsp;– March 12 were about the Anti-Kony movement.  Social media outlets, such as Facebook, were responsible for informing 27% of young adults of the Kony 2012 video, compared to 10% who learned about it through other traditional platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/15/the-viral-kony-2012-video/|title=The Viral Kony 2012 Video|date=2012-03-15|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Kony 2012 made a significant impact throughout social media platforms. During that short period of time, it became YouTube's number one video of reaching a certain number of views within a short period of time, along with over 5 million related tweets occurring over just a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/The_Viral_Kony_2012_Video.pdf|title=The Viral Kony 2012 Video|last=Rainie|first=Lee|date=|website=Pew Research|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virality of the Movement ===

In under a week, the video created by Invisible Children, Kony 2012 had been viewed over 100 million times.&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"&gt;http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/kony-2012-documentary-becomes-most-viral-video-in-history/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine credits Invisible Children's strong base of followers on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Unlike other videos that accidentally "go viral", Kony 2012 was created to elicit emotional responses and encourage viewers to share the footage and spread the hashtag. This attracted the attention of celebrities like [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Rihanna]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Justin Bieber]], and [[Kim Kardashian-West]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the video's popularity, not all interactions were positive. But the more criticism the video drew, the more people watched it and shared it so that they could be a part of the conversation. Their Public Relations team was not ready for the over night fame and failed to control the narrative of the fall out.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

Forbes gives a breakdown of 12 reasons why the video went so viral. They cite that the video invoked positive feelings, grabbed viewers attention, made it personal, referenced mainstream media, pulled on the heartstrings, conveyed immediacy, made it simple, made it real, gave it a scale, used celebrities, created events, and made it easy to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/03/09/12-lessons-from-kony-2012-from-social-media-power-users/#45f979dd4328&lt;/ref&gt; These 12 basic tactics affected viewers so much so that the Kony 2012 campaign sold out of merchandise when their two interns could not keep up with the hundreds of thousands of action kits supporters could buy. Jason Russel told Business Insider, "We sourced every single red T-shirt in the entire US. There were no more to buy."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-guy-behind-the-kony-2012-video-finally-explains-how-everything-went-so-weird-2013-3?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; The google trends for searches like "Joseph Kony" and "Kony 2012" all show flatlines until the video was released where the spike reaches all the way to 100%.&lt;ref&gt;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=Kony%202012&lt;/ref&gt; Before Invisible Children released the video, Joseph Kony and the LRA were mostly unknown to America and the rest of the world.

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW)'s Africa division senior researcher [[Anneke Van Woudenberg]] wrote in a statement: "We've spent years investigating the horrors perpetrated by the LRA in central Africa—Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), and South Sudan. We gathered evidence at massacre sites—wooden clubs covered in dried blood, rubber strips from bicycle tires used to tie up the victims, and freshly dug graves—and spoke to hundreds of boys and girls forced to fight for his army or held captive as [[sexual slavery|sex slaves]]. And we're elated that #stopKony is a trending topic on [[Twitter]]—if anyone deserves global notoriety it's Kony." She added: "Arresting Kony and other senior LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice. It will also help end the scourge of one of the most brutal rebel groups in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/09/how-catch-joseph-kony |title=How to Catch Joseph Kony &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW's LRA researcher Ida Sawyer reaffirmed, "we definitely support the message of the film and we think it's great that they're bringing so much attention to the film with Kony's crimes and the phenomena of the LRA."&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news|author1=Polly Curtis |author2=Tom McCarthy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/08/kony-2012-what-s-the-story#block-14 |title=Kony 2012: what's the real story? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]], which had documented what it described as the LRA's "horrific impact on the lives of thousands of civilians in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Uganda" and for years had been calling for the LRA leaders to be arrested, welcomed the massive public response to the Kony 2012 campaign. Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," but added: "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect [[human rights]]", especially because "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

Opinions on the film were mixed in [[Gulu]], one of former centers of rebel activities in northern Uganda, during a showing of the film, with several of the leaders expressing support and criticism. One of the attendees, State Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Henry Oryem Okello]], said that the criticisms directed at the film and Invisible Children were "unfounded", going on to state, "Invisible Children has done visible things in [[Acholi]][land], for example offering scholarships to thousands of children and anyone against them is our enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 video divides opinion in Gulu |author1=Sam Lawino |author2=Moses Akena |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1369072/-/ax98g6z/-/ |newspaper=Saturday Monitor |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betty Bigombe]], a Ugandan cabinet minister and former peace negotiator, said, "I do not know whether it makes any difference as far as taking [Kony] out is concerned.

Journalist [[Nicholas D. Kristof]] thanked Invisible Children for making the film and addressed its criticism, stating that rather than being [[The White Man's Burden|"white man's burden"]], when "a warlord continues to kill and torture across a swath of Congo and Central African Republic&amp;nbsp;... it's a human burden." He also said that complexity had long been "a leading excuse for inaction during atrocities" and that Kony remains a threat in Uganda's neighbour countries, so the simplicity of the film "has left the American public more informed" than it would be otherwise, and that if he "were a Congolese villager", he would "welcome these uncertain efforts over the sneering scorn of do-nothing armchair cynics."&lt;ref name=Kristof&gt;{{cite news |title=Viral Video, Vicious Warlord |author=[[Nicholas D.

Mikaela Luttrell-Rowland from [[Clark University]]'s Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies stated that it was "irresponsible to prize feel good, simplistic messages over complex history and to treat [[consumerism|consumerist]]-consciousness raising as interchangeable with education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mikaela-luttrellrowland/consumerism-trumps-educat_b_1337067.html Consumerism Trumps Education: The Kony 2012 Campaign], ''Huffington Post'', November 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Africa researcher [[Alex de Waal]] accused the film of "peddling dangerous and patronizing falsehoods," criticized the campaign as "naive" for "elevating Kony to a global celebrity, the embodiment of evil," that might only help him as a terrorist and cult leader, and called for instead "demystifying Kony—reducing him to a common criminal and a failed provincial politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2012/03/10/dont-elevate-kony/ |title=Don't Elevate Kony &amp;#124; Reinventing Peace |publisher=Sites.tufts.edu |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One point of criticism is that the film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself was believed to be in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video.&lt;ref name="Keating20120307"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/07/guest_post_joseph_kony_is_not_in_uganda_and_other_complicated_things |title=Guest post: Joseph Kony is not in Uganda (and other complicated things) |accessdate=March 8, 2012|date=March 7, 2012|work=Foreign Policy|author=Keating, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates.

[[Dinaw Mengestu]], an [[Ethiopian American]] writer and Africa researcher, wrote that the real world Kony is "not a click away", and a simple solution of raising popular awareness, "a beautiful equation that can only work so long as we believe that nothing in the world happens unless we know about it&amp;nbsp;... only works in the [[Myopia|myopic]] reality of the film, a reality that deliberately eschews depth and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warscapes.com/reportage/not-click-away-joseph-kony-real-world |title=Not a Click Away: Joseph Kony in the Real World |publisher=Warscapes |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Amanda Weisbaum of the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] said that "just getting rid of one person does not solve the problem" and the film's focus should have been rather on helping ex-child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child/ |title=Not enough focus on child soldiers’ lives in "Kony 2012" -War Child&amp;nbsp;– AlertNet |publisher=Trust.org |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705072012/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child |archivedate=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Goddard, president and CEO of [[ChildFund|ChildFund International]], wrote that "by narrowing the focus on Kony, by defining success so singularly, it gives people a greater sense that the issue [of globally widespread conscription of young children] can be resolved.

After the film's release, there was criticism in Uganda of its failure to state more clearly that Kony and his forces fled northern Uganda in 2006 and were dispersed across the jungles of three neighbouring countries. Fred Opolot, spokesman for the Ugandan government, said, "It is totally misleading to suggest that the war is still in Uganda."&lt;ref name="pflanz"/&gt; Arthur Larok, [[ActionAid]]'s director in Uganda, said, "It doesn't sound like a fair representation of Uganda.

A March 2012 mass showing of the film in [[Lira, Uganda|Lira]], the site of one of Kony's worst atrocities in Uganda, was met with jeering and thrown objects at the screen and at the group African Youth Initiative Network, which screened the film and provided translations. The screening prompted angry calls to local radio stations by Ugandans upset that the film was so focused on the filmmakers and Kony while neglecting the conflict's victims, prompting complaints that the film was "more about whites than Ugandans."&lt;ref name=screening/&gt; Others objected to being reminded of the horrors Kony brought to Uganda.

Mahmood Mamdani, director of the Institute of Social Research at [[Makerere University]], [[Kampala]], argued that the LRA is "a Ugandan problem calling for a Ugandan political solution" and against "mobilisation of millions [to] be subverted into yet another weapon in the hands of those who want to further militarise the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/03/20123138139642455.html |title=Kony: What Jason did not tell the Invisible Children&amp;nbsp;– Opinion|publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugandan journalist Rosebell Kagumire said that "the war is much more complex than one man called Joseph Kony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/08/kony-2012-what-s-the-story |title=Kony 2012: what's the real story? |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent showing of ''Kony 2012'' at Pece War Memorial Stadium in Gulu, Uganda sparked a riot in which dozens of people were injured.

Margaret Aciro, whose picture appears in the video showing her face mutilated by the LRA, said she "became sad" after seeing it being "used to profit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1387926/-/aw2cd3z/-/index.html |title=Kony 2012 video makers using us to make profit, war victim says - National |publisher=monitor.co.ug |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Ernest Sugule, national coordinator of the Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in [[Dungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Dungu, DRC]], claimed that the few people there "who have succeeded in watching [''Kony 2012''] are very critical on the film," as is he himself.&lt;ref name=next/&gt; Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), said Invisible Children, "haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action.

===Decline of the Movement===



The fame of director [[Jason Russell]]'s 30-minute documentary was short-lived.

Delinquent acts of graffiti from the movement's followers and lewd acts by creator Jason Russell led to further criticism of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holt|first1=Mytheos|title=‘Kony 2012’: Viral Video’s Filmmaker Arrested for Lewd Acts|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/03/16/scandals-dog-kony-2012-graffiti-appears-in-texas-originator-arrested-for-lewd-acts/|accessdate=18 October 2017|agency=The Blaze|date=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the movement's nature as a meme transformed it to be unattractive platform for some to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Katie|title=Think Twice Before Donating to Kony 2012, the Charitable Meme du Jour|url=https://jezebel.com/5891269/think-twice-before-donating-to-kony-2012-the-meme-du-jour|accessdate=18 October 2017|agency=jezebel|publisher=gizmodo|date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invisible Children's response===
On March 8, 2012, Invisible Children released an official response addressing the criticisms directed at ''Kony 2012''. As an explanation for the simplicity of the movie, they stated that "in [their] quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy, [they] sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format." Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, responded to the new criticisms by saying that they were "myopic" and that the video itself was a "tipping point" that "got young people to care about an issue on the other side of the planet that doesn't affect them."&lt;ref name="Post1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children responds to criticism about 'Stop Kony' campaign |author=Elizabeth Flock |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/invisible-childrens-stop-kony-campaign/2012/03/07/gIQA7B31wR_blog.html?wprss=blogpost |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army". They added that the reason why they are working with the Ugandan army even though Kony is no longer in Uganda is that the army is "more organized and better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries (DRC, South Sudan, CAR) to track down Joseph Kony" and that they want all of the governments in the region to work together to arrest Kony.&lt;ref name="Invisible Children Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invisible Children Critiques |url=http://www.invisiblechildren.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/critiques.html |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308102109/http://www.invisiblechildren.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/critiques.html |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins stated, "There is a huge problem with [[political corruption]] in Africa.

A video titled ''Thank you, KONY 2012 Supporters'' was released on March 12, 2012 to address the criticisms directed at the film and to be "fully transparent", according to Invisible Children CEO Ben Keesey. The film begins with Keesey discussing the three things that the charity focuses on, which are to "create films with compelling narratives, promote international advocacy and run on-the-ground initiatives." He also points out that "overhead and travel costs are essential to those efforts", as a part of the group's management expenses, along with going toward "thousands of free screenings of the group's films worldwide, as well as toward bringing survivors of the Lord's Resistance Army&amp;nbsp;... to speak at these events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children Releases New Video in Response to ‘Kony 2012’ Criticism |author=Samantha Grossman |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/invisible-children-releases-new-video-in-response-to-kony-2012-criticism/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keesey explains the way the charity's annual expenditures are made, with "80.5 percent to 85.7 percent of total annual spending from fiscal 2007 to 2011" going toward {{"'}}program expenses'—money that directly benefits their cause",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony 2012: Invisible Children release new film responding to criticism |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/joseph-kony/9139970/Joseph-Kony-2012-Invisible-Children-release-new-film-responding-to-criticism.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished by urging interested parties to make inquires to the group via [[Twitter]], using the account @invisible and hashtag #AskICAnything.

In a pre-release comment, [[popular culture]] expert [[Robert Thompson (professor)|Robert Thompson]] said: "The fact is, the story has developed in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something they did not know before.

==Impact==

===United States===
On March 21, 2012, a resolution "condemning Joseph Kony and his ruthless guerrilla group for a 26-year campaign of terror" was put forward by [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Jim Inhofe]] and [[Chris Coons]]. The resolution stated that it would back "the effort of Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and the newest country, South Sudan, to stop Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army", along with an official statement of support "for the U.S. effort to help regional forces pursue commanders of the militia group." Overall, the resolution received support from 34 senators, both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate pushes measure condemning Kony |author=Donna Cassata |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/03/21/senate_pushes_measure_condemning_kony/|date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2015 |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony captures Congress' attention |author=Scott Wong |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74355.html |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support among senators for the resolution came about after the release of the ''Kony 2012'' video and its subsequent popularity. One of the resolution leaders, Senator Chris Coons, became aware of the situation after his daughters asked him what he was doing to stop Kony and Senator [[Roy Blunt]] was informed "at a Missouri caucus in St. Louis when a constituent quizzed him about Kony". One of the co-sponsors of the resolution, Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], stated that, "When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined."&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt;

===Africa===
{{see also|Lord's Resistance Army insurgency}}

On March 23, 2012, the [[African Union]] (AU) announced its intentions to send an international brigade of 5,000 military troops "from Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Congo, countries where Kony's reign of terror has been felt over the years ... to join the hunt for rebel leader Joseph Kony" and to "neutralize" him. According to the statement, the mission commenced on March 24, 2012, and the search "will last until Kony is caught",&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012: African Union ramps up hunt for Uganda rebel leader in wake of viral video |author=Rodney Muhumuza |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1150843--kony-2012-african-union-ramps-up-hunt-for-uganda-rebel-leader-in-wake-of-viral-video |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012 |work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the task force will be disbanded.

The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said the agency welcomed the "unprecedented" initiative to "end the atrocities in the region" and urged all involved to respect human rights and minimize risk to civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/03/kony-lords-resistance-army-increased-attacks.html |title=Kony militia steps up attacks in Congo, Central African Republic |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AU [[counter-terrorism]] envoy Francisco Madeira said, "We need to stop Kony." The ICC chief prosecutor [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] voiced confidence that the video will "produce the arrest of Joseph Kony this year," adding: "That is the impact of the campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/01/204536.html |title=Viral video will spur Kony arrest this year: ICC&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo!

A '''latent human error''' is a [[human error]] which is likely to be made due to systems or routines that are formed in such a way that humans are disposed to making these errors. Latent human error is a term used in safety work and accident prevention, especially in [[aviation]].

By gathering data about errors made, then collating, grouping and analyzing them, it can be determined whether a disproportionate amount of similar errors are being made. If this is the case, a contributing factor may be disharmony between the respective systems/routines and human nature or [[Propensity probability|propensities]]. The routines or systems can then be analyzed, potential problems identified, and amendments made if necessary, in order to prevent future errors, incidents or accidents.

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|380px|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (August 23, 1572) in Paris, France (painting by [[François Dubois]])]]
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being phased out due to its extreme size and impracticality. If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--Need to add: Jonestown Massacre--&gt;

The following is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "[[massacre]]."&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze&gt;{{harvnb|Mikaberidze|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[:wikt:massacre|Massacre]]'' is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people or (less commonly) animals; carnage, butchery, slaughter in numbers". It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history".&lt;ref name=OED_N&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use in English of the word ''massacre'' in the name of an event is due to [[Christopher Marlow]] who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as "The massacre at Paris"&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe (c. 1600) (''title'') The massacre at Paris". [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
''Massacre'' can also be used as a verb, as "To kill (people or, less commonly, animals) in numbers, esp. brutally and indiscriminately".&lt;ref name=OED_V/&gt; The first usage of which was "(c. 1588) Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the æternall, and massaker soules (...) are dangerous subjects",&lt;ref name=OED_V&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, v.&lt;/ref&gt; and this usage is not recorded in this list.--&gt;

The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically.
There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as [[:wikt:butchery|butchery]], [[:wikt:carnage|carnage]],  [[:wikt:bloodbath|bloodbath]], [[:wikt:mass killing|mass killing]], [[wikt:atrocity|atrocity]], etc. as well as euphemisms such as ''[[Sicilian Vespers|Vespers]]'', ''[[Blutgericht]]'' or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list.
''Massacre'' is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "[[Hilo massacre]]" and the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list.

==List of events==
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being reduced in size due to current unwieldiness; events listed should only include events very widely, or overwhelmingly known under a name including the term "massacre".  If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--
;Inclusion criteria
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "massacre" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a massacre does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word ''massacre'' must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#If possible, cite the date of the earliest authority giving the name in question under the "name" column
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.
;Notes
#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "massacre" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.--&gt;
&lt;!--''Note: the location column will sort by the following [[United Nations geoscheme|sub regions]]: Eastern Africa, Southern Africa, Central America, North America, South America, Eastern Asia, South-eastern Asia, Southern Asia, Western Asia, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, and Oceania''--&gt;

''massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy'' which term had been in use since the 17th century (Louis Maimbourg, ''Histoire De La Ligue'', 1686).
Appositional "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre" (rather than genitival "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day") first appears in American English in the first half of the 20th century (Oberlin Alumni Magazine 31.4, 1935, p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{sort|America North|[[Boston]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]}}
|[[Boston Massacre]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was almost immediately termed a "massacre" and used for propagandistic purposes, especially by [[Samuel Adams]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment, which with the 14th regiment were then quartered there; with some observations on the state of things prior to that catastrophe'' was printed still in 1770.
Appositional "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, ''Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism'', 1803, 
 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=fvY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 p. 314]).
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance  held during 1771&amp;ndash;1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, ''Old Boston: An American Historical Romance'', 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.

&lt;!--after 1930 or so, journalistic use of the term "massacre" becomes too indiscriminate to the point of being used synonymously with "murder" or "unjustified killing".
Questionable list entries also include such names for pre-1930s events which were coined only significantly later.

|During the 1990s, many [[Algerian Civil War#Village massacres|large-scale massacres of villagers]] in Algeria were perpetrated by groups attacking villages at night and cutting the throats of the inhabitants. The [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) has avowed its responsibility for many of them. The massacres peaked in 1997 (with a smaller peak in 1994). According to a few reports former Algerian army officer, Habib Souaidia testified to his government's involvement in the massacres.

In fact, survivors who openly accuse the army for its failure to intervene also expressed no doubt about the identity of the killers, pointing to the Islamist guerrillas (e.g. Tuquoi 1997). Moreover, some of the troubling aspects of this story can be explained without reference to an army conspiracy. For example, in civil wars prisoners tend to be killed on the spot rather than taken prisoner (Laqueur 1998).11 Militiamen, the most likely to capture guerrillas, have openly stated that they took no prisoners (AI 1997b: 17). Journalists working in the field have found credible testimonies in support of the thesis that most massacres are organized by the rebels (Leclère 1997; Tuquoi 1997 among others). European foreign ministries believe that it is Islamist guerrillas who are responsible for the massacres (Observer 9 February 1998). Although, it is impossible to know the full truth at this point (see Charef 1998), the assumption that many massacres were committed by the Islamist guerrillas seems plausible and is widely adopted by area experts (Addi 1998: 44) and other authors (Smith 1998: 27). Likewise, the reluctance of the army to intervene and stop some of these massacres is also beyond doubt."&lt;/ref&gt;

|A group of 100 armed men, alleged to include police and private militia led by Andal Ampatuan, Jr., stopped a convoy of five cars transporting Genalyn Tiamzon-Mangudadatu, the wife of [[Esmael Mangudadatu]], who is running for provincial governor in the [[Philippine general election, 2010|2010 Philippine elections]]. She was en route to the town of [[Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao|Shariff Aguak]] to file a certificate of candidacy for her husband, accompanied by his sisters, other supporters, and members of the press. The attackers kidnapped and later killed all members of the Mangudadatu group; reports state that women in the group were raped before being killed. Five other people not part of the group, in a car behind the convoy, were also kidnapped and killed.&lt;ref name="Maguindanao massacre"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130111072722/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleid=526314 Maguindanao massacre], The Philippine Star, November 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gmanews.tv"&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/177820/death-toll-in-maguindanao-massacre-now-57-afp Death toll in Maguindanao massacre now 57], GMANews.TV, November 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toll Rising in Philippines Massacre"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/world/asia/26phils.html Toll Rising in Philippines Massacre], NYTimes.com, November 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/25/death-toll-philippines-massacre-57 Clan allied to Philippine president suspected of being behind massacre], guardian.co.uk, November 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/177776/innocent-motorists-among-ampatuan-massacre-victims Innocent motorists among Ampatuan massacre victims], GMANews.TV, November 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

*[[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)]] was sometimes referred to as "Fort Blunder", because the first version of the U.S. fort was inadvertently built on the Canadian side of the border.
* The [[NASA]] [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], launched in 1998, burned up in the Martian atmosphere. A mixup between metric and [[U.S. customary unit|US Standard]] measurements in the controlling software caused the spacecraft to miss its intended 140–150&amp;nbsp;km altitude above Mars during orbit insertion, instead entering the Martian atmosphere at about 57&amp;nbsp;km.
* The NASA [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] mission was an attempt to sample particles from the solar wind. It successfully collected a sample and returned to Earth. However at the last moment the landing parachute failed to open and the return capsule smashed into the ground at high speed, contaminating the samples. The parachute failure was traced to an [[Genesis (spacecraft)#Mishap_Investigation_Board_(MIB)|accelerometer installed backwards]].
* The Quebec bridge disaster. 
* [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)]]
* [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] caused by a faulty blowout preventer.

This is a '''list of serious injuries and deaths''' in which one or more subjects of a [[selfie]] were killed or injured, either before, during or after having taken a photo of themselves, with the accident at least in part attributed to the taking of the photo.

The [[United States Department of Transportation]] estimated that during 2014, the so-called "year of the selfie",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/tech/twitter-selfie-trend/index.html|title=Twitter declares 2014 year of the selfie|last=CNN|first=Naomi Ng, for|website=CNN|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ie/trends/2014/story/selfies.html|title=The year of the selfie|website=www.google.ie|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 33,000 people were injured while driving and using a cell-phone in some fashion, which can include talking, listening, and "manual button/control actuation" including taking, uploading, downloading, editing, or opening  of selfies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812260 |title=Distracted Driving 2014 (DOT HS 812 260) |publisher=DOT NHTSA |author= |date=April 2016 |access-date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 survey by [[Erie Insurance Group]] found that 4% of all drivers admitted to taking selfies while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/romantic-encounters-behind-the-wheel-are-a-driving-distraction/2015/03/30/f76c8baa-d3f1-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html |title=Flossing, selfies, romantic encounters: Driving distractions, by the numbers |work=Washington Post |author=Ashley Halsey III |date=March 30, 2015 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported in January 2016 that "about half" of at least 27 "selfie related" deaths in 2015 had occurred in [[India]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/01/14/more-people-die-taking-selfies-in-india-than-anywhere-else-in-the-world/|title=More people died taking selfies in India last year than anywhere else in the world&amp;nbsp;— The Washington Post|date=14 January 2016|access-date=6 March 2016|author=Annie Gowen|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; No official data on the number of people who died taking selfies in India exists, but reports show from 2014 up to August 2016, there have been at least 54 deaths in India while taking selfies.&lt;ref name="ht" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Tourism (India)|Indian Ministry of Tourism]] asked states to identify and barricade ‘selfie danger’ areas, its first national attempt to deal with the selfie deaths. [[Mumbai Police]] identified at least 16 danger zones after a man drowned attempting to save a selfie-taker.&lt;ref name="ht"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-no-selfies-allowed-in-front-of-national-memorials-from-august-12-18/story-8BrHFgmxKpnvOUzdsT6U1N.html |title=Freeze frame: States asked to spot ‘selfie danger’ areas  |work=Hindustan Times |author= |date=August 10, 2016 |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No-selfie zones were also established in certain areas of the [[Kumbh Mela]] because organizers feared bottlenecks caused by selfie-takers could spark stampedes.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

A 2018 study of news reports showed that between October 2011 to November 2017, there were 259 selfie deaths in 137 incidents reported globally, with the highest occurrences in India followed by Russia, United States, and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bansal |first1=Agam |last2=el al |title=Selfies: A boon or bane? |journal=Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care |date=July 2018 |doi=10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_109_18 |pmid=30234062 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131996/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean age was 22.94 years old with male deaths outnumbering female about three to one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4392">{{short description|2016 hoax about marijuana cigarettes}}
{{tone|date=November 2018}}

The '''Marlboro M Hoax''' was a false rumor originating from satire news website ''Abril Uno'' on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abriluno.com/phillip-morris-introduces-marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=Phillip Morris Introduces ‘Marlboro M’ Marijuana Cigarettes|last=RapidxHTML|work=Abril Uno|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] joke.

== Hoax ==
The article claims that Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BARRY|first=RACHEL ANN|last2=HIILAMO|first2=HEIKKI|last3=GLANTZ|first3=STANTON A.|date=2014-06|title=Waiting for the Opportune Moment: The Tobacco Industry and Marijuana Legalization|url=https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en-US|volume=92|issue=2|pages=207–242|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12055|issn=0887-378X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article was quite obviously satire, it's intriguing title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=FACT CHECK: Has Phillip Morris Introduced 'Marlboro M' Marijuana Cigarettes?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/no-philip-morris-not-introduced-marlboro-m-cannabis-cigarette|title=False: Marlboro Marijuana Cigarettes from Phillip Morris {{!}} Leafly|date=2016-10-10|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannettes/comments/63jxuv/what_are_marijuana_cigarettes_called_cannettes/|title=r/Cannettes - What are Marijuana Cigarettes Called? (Cannettes)|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially an addition to their company, long before rapid legalization came about.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/big-tobacco-pot-weed-cannabis-industry-727407/|title=Big Tobacco Is Already Eyeing Pot|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=2018-09-25|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marycarreon/2018/05/17/new-study-highlights-the-social-impacts-of-cannabis-legalization-in-california/#1836c73e2194|title=New Study Highlights The Social Impacts Of Cannabis Legalization In California|last=Carreon|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/22/big-tobacco-makes-its-first-investment-in-the-mari.aspx|title=Big Tobacco Makes Its First Investment in the Marijuana Industry --  The Motley Fool|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2018-07-22|work=The Motley Fool|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it would be illegal for such a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes, as its use is still illegal on the federal level (in the US).

== Background and official line-up ==
Originally, it was supposed to be a Brazilian version of the famous German [[Wacken Open Air]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; However, the promoters failed to obtain official permission to use the name, so they decided to switch it for Metal Open Air.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; From that moment on, several bands, including [[Shaman (Brazilian band)|Shaman]], [[Megadeth]], [[Symphony X]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]],&lt;ref name="vírgula"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sem shows nem estrutura, Metal Open Air é cancelado|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/ver/noticia/festivais-de-musica/2012/04/21/298723-sem-shows-nem-estrutura-metal-open-air-e-cancelado|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=[[Universo Online|Vírgula]]|date=21 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; started to confirm their performances, though a few have cancelled, including [[Shadowside]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salzano Jr|first=Costábile|title=Metal Open Air: Shadowside cancela participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/147389-krisiun.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=3 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krisiun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Krisiun cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_840/152194-metalopenair.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=12 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Volbeat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Volbeat cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_843/146543-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=23 January 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly for logistical reasons.

By February/March 2012, the official announced line-up was as follows (act names in '''bold''' are headliners; El Diablo is an entertainment group that prepared rock night parties after every headliner performance):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: anunciada a programação oficial do evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/148537-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=17 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headliners of the second day, the [[Rock and Roll All Stars]], were a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] composed of [[Gene Simmons]], [[Joe Elliott]], [[Matt Sorum]], [[Duff McKagan]] , [[Gilby Clarke]], [[Glenn Hughes]], [[Ed Roland]], [[Sebastian Bach]], [[Steve Stevens]], [[Mike Inez]], [[Billy Duffy]] and [[Charlie Sheen]], who was to be the festival's [[master of ceremonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Sheen convida para o Metal Open Air, que ocorre a partir de 20 de abril no Maranhão|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/ultnot/2012/04/09/charlie-sheen-convida-para-o-metal-open-air-que-ocorre-a-partir-de-20-de-abril-no-maranhao.jhtm|publisher=[[Universo Online|UOL Música]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Paulo|language=Portuguese|date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The festival and the cancellations ==
[[File:Symphony x 2004.tiff|thumb|right|220px|[[Michael Romeo]] (left) and [[Russell Allen]] (right); Symphony X was among the very few bands that managed to make a performance at the festival.]]

Shortly before and even during the festival, several bands cancelled their performances. British thrash band Venom, for example, had their [[Visa (document)|visas]] sent to Africa instead of Brazil by mistake,&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; thus making it impossible for them to take part of MOA and two other South American festivals. [[Hansi Kürsch]], vocalist for German power metal quartet Blind Guardian, stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air 2012 performance cancelled|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/04/21/metal-open-air-2012-performance-cancelled/|publisher=Official Blind Guardian website|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|date=21 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''In 25 years of our career we [...] have been extremely successful in the avoidance of cancelled shows, so far. This unfortunately comes to a very sad end here in São Luís. Due to massive technical and administrative problems we were forced to cancel tonight's show. As far as we understand it seems to be the local management who has not been able to secure a proper festival environment, anymore. Things are pretty out of hand there. We feel very sorry about this totally unsatisfying situation, but the mistakes made by the local promoter makes an even improvised show impossible. [...] In the future we will be more careful in confirming such festivals.''}}

[[Aquiles Priester]], from Hangar, also cancelled his band's participation, stating:&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

{{cquote|''We negotiated everything via oral conversation, but we made ourselves very much clear that we needed the total cash before our performance, since we needed to pay our trip to São Luís in our very own bus. We wouldn't accept, by any means, to play without our backline. So far, we were paid with only 25% of the cash to cover all our expenses (fuel, accommodation and food for the band and crew), we needed at least 75%.''}}

Terra Prima's members didn't receive their air tickets to São Luís nor the confirmation of their accommodations in the city.&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

Symphony X, one of the few bands that managed to take on the stage and perform, posted a note some days later, thanking their fans for the show and criticizing the event's structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air|url=http://www.symphonyx.com/site/news/metal-open-air/|publisher=Official Symphony X website|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''We want to thank the fans for sticking it out on Friday night! We were extremely close to having to cancel the show due to technical reasons and did not know if we would even play for sure until an hour before the set, which had already been delayed two hours. The lack of organization and chaos surrounding the event, which had also been noted by the media, had forced many bands to cancel. This is unfair to the fans in attendance, and unfortunately these fans were robbed of many performances.''}}

[[Dave Mustaine]], from Megadeth, also thanked his fans and regretted the festival's organization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megadeth Mainman On Brazil's METAL OPEN AIR: 'We Were Playing For The People'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=172916|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''To the fans last night in São Luís, thank you. It's all I can say. One Big Mega Thank You! Yesterday's show in Sao Luis was very challenging, but we did it! [...] I was told a lot of the talent opted out from coming. I was also told the tickets cost $450 [[Brazilian real]] for the three-day weekend, and $250 BRL for just one day. The average person in this area makes $28 BRL a day, so you can do the math. [...] We were playing, no matter what. We weren't playing for the promoter anymore; we were playing for the people!''}}

[[Ricardo Confessori]], drummer for [[Shaman]], publicly contested Anthrax guitarist [[Scott Ian]] for canceling the band's performance at the festival, accusing him of not giving a good excuse for  the fans, to which Ian replied that the problem was "the whole terrible organization. We never want to cancel but they made it impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Scott_Ian/status/193877446603448320 Confessori's and Ian's discussion] at [[Twitter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, a total of 30 of the 47 invited bands cancelled their performances due to the severe logistical, structural and financial problems regarding the festival.&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; As for the fans, some had to camp inside [[stable]]s, with almost no electricity, lack of places to buy food, beverage and hygiene products and only one public toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freire|first=Pedro Henrique|title=Estábulos para cavalos viram área de camping para o público|url=http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml|publisher=O Imparcial|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|language=Portuguese|date=20 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524014607/http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml#|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbosa|first=Alex|title=

== Aftermath ==
Soon after MOA was cancelled, both companies responsible for the festival (Negri Concerts and Lamparina Filmes e Produções) accused each other of breaking contractual rules.&lt;ref name=negrivslamparina&gt;{{cite web|last=Louise|first=Aline|title=Produtoras do Metal Open Air trocam acusações em cartas abertas|url=http://musica.terra.com.br/produtoras-do-metal-open-air-trocam-acusacoes-em-cartas-abertas,fa3cbbd670a5a310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html|publisher=Terra|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|language=Portuguese|date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biological hazard]]s can refer to a diverse array of [[disease]], [[infection]], [[infestation]] and [[invasive species]].

Many geophysical hazards are related;&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Joel C.|last2=Malamud|first2=Bruce D.|title=Reviewing and visualizing the interactions of natural hazards|journal=[[Reviews of Geophysics]]|date=December 2014|volume=52|issue=4|pages=680–722|doi=10.1002/2013RG000445|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013RG000445/abstract|bibcode=2014RvGeo..52..680G}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[submarine earthquake]]s can cause [[tsunami]]s, and [[hurricane]]s can lead to [[coastal flood]]ing and [[coastal erosion|erosion]]. Floods and wildfires can result from a combination of geological, [[hydrology|hydrological]], and climatic factors. It is possible that some natural hazards are intertemporally correlated as well.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Philip E.|last2=Bresnock|first2=Anne E.|title=Are Natural Hazards Temporally Random?|journal=[[Applied Geography]]|date=1 January 1985|volume=5|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.1016/0143-6228(85)90002-5|ssrn=1679224}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the distinction between a natural ''hazard'' and a [[natural disaster|natural ''disaster'']] is that the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] was a disaster, whereas living on a [[fault (geology)|fault]] line is a hazard.

==Geological hazards==
{{Main article|Geohazard}}

===Avalanche===
An avalanche occurs when a large snow (or rock) mass slides down a mountainside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snow avalanches|url=http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science/avalanches.html|website=All about snow|publisher=National Snow &amp; Ice Data Center|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An avalanche is an example of a gravity current consisting of granular material. In an avalanche, lots of material or mixtures of different types of material fall or slide rapidly under the force of gravity. Avalanches are often classified by the size or severity of consequences resulting from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Public Avalanche Danger Scale|url=http://www.avalanche.org/danger_card.php|website=Avalanche.org|publisher=American Avalanche Association|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquake===
{{See also|Lists of earthquakes|Soil liquefaction}}
[[Image:Sanfranciscoearthquake1906.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Francisco]] was devastated by an [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake]] in 1906]]
An [[earthquake]] is the sudden relof energy stored as lithospheric stress that radiates [[seismic wave]]s. At the [[Earth]]'s surface, earthquakes may manifest with a shaking or displacement of the ground; when the [[earthquake]] occurs on the seafloor, the resulting displacement of water can sometimes result in a [[tsunami]]. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-km-long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the [[Pacific Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simkin, Tom|display-authors=3|author2=Tilling, Robert I.|author3=Vogt, Peter R.|author4=Kirby, Stephen H.|author5=Kimberly, Paul|author6=Stewart, David B.|title=This Dynamic Planet: World map of volcanoes, earthquakes, impact craters, and plate tectonics|date=2006|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey Map I-2800|isbn=1-411-30959-6|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/|accessdate=18 July 2014|archiveurl=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/|archivedate=7 Jan 2014|format=map}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many earthquakes happen each day, few of which are large enough to cause significant damage.

===Coastal erosion===
[[Coastal erosion]] is a physical process by which shorelines in coastal areas around the world shift and change, primarily in response to waves and currents that can be influenced by tides and storm surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komar|first1=Paul D.|title=CRC handbook of coastal processes and erosion|date=1983|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=9780849302251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal erosion can result from long-term processes (see also [[beach evolution]]) as well as from episodic events such as [[tropical cyclone]]s or other severe storm events.

===Lahar===
A [[lahar]] is a type of natural event closely related to a [[volcanic eruption]], and involves a large amount of material originating from an eruption of a glaciated volcano, including mud from the melted ice, [[rock (geology)|rock]], and [[Volcanic ash|ash]] sliding down the side of the [[volcano]] at a rapid pace. These flows can destroy entire towns in seconds and kill thousands of people, and form [[flood basalt]].
This is based on natural events.

===Landslide===
A [[landslide]] is a mass displacement of sediment, usually down a slope. It can be caused by pressure pulling natural objects down a declining hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Nicholas K.|title=Geohazards: natural and human|date=1995|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=9780023229923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinkhole===
A [[sinkhole]] is a localized depression in the surface topography, usually caused by the collapse of a subterranean structure such as a [[cave]]. Although rare, large sinkholes that develop suddenly in populated areas can lead to the collapse of buildings and other structures.

===Volcanic eruption===
[[Image:Puu Oo cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puʻu ʻŌʻō]]]]
A [[volcanic eruption]] is the point in which a [[volcano]] is active and releases its power, and the eruptions come in many forms. They range from daily small eruptions which occur in places like [[Kilauea]] in [[Hawaii]], to megacolossal eruptions (where the volcano expels at least 1,000 cubic kilometers of material) from supervolcanoes like [[Lake Taupo]] (26,500 years ago) and [[Yellowstone Caldera]]. According to the [[Toba catastrophe theory]], 70 to 75 thousand years ago, a [[Supervolcano|supervolcanic]] event at [[Lake Toba]] reduced the human population to 10,000 or even 1,000 breeding pairs, creating a bottleneck in [[human evolution]]. Some eruptions form [[pyroclastic flows]], which are high-temperature clouds of ash and steam that can travel down mountainsides at speed exceeding an airliner.

==Meteorological or climate hazards==
[[Image:Young steer after blizzard - NOAA.jpg|thumb|Young steer after a blizzard, March 1966]]

===Blizzard===
A blizzard is a severe winter storm with icy and windy conditions characterized by low temperature, strong wind and heavy snow.

===Drought===
A drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric, surface water or ground water.
Scientists warn that [[global warming]] and  [[climate change]] may result in more extensive [[drought]]s in coming years. These extensive droughts are likely to occur within the African continent due to its very low precipitation levels and high temperatures.

===Hailstorm===
A [[hail]]storm is a natural hazard where a thunderstorm produces numerous [[hailstone]]s which damage the location in which they fall. Hailstorms can be especially devastating to [[farm]] fields, ruining crops and damaging equipment.

===Heat wave===
A [[heat wave]] is a hazard characterized by [[heat]] which is considered extreme and unusual in the area in which it occurs. Heat waves are rare and require specific combinations of [[weather]] events to take place, and may include [[temperature inversion]]s, [[katabatic winds]], or other phenomena. There is potential for longer-term events causing [[global warming]], including [[stadial]] events (the opposite to glacial "ice age" events), or through human-induced climatic warming.

===Cyclonic storm===
Cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure.
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Hurricane Katrina]]]]
[[Hurricane]], [[tropical cyclone]], and [[typhoon]] are different names for the cyclonic [[storm]] system that forms over the oceans. It is caused by evaporated [[water]] that comes off of the [[ocean]] and becomes a [[storm]]. The [[Coriolis effect]] causes the storms to spin.{{convert|74|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Hurricane'' is used for these phenomena in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]s, ''tropical cyclone'' in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], and ''typhoon'' in the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

===Ice storm===
An [[ice storm]] is a particular [[weather]] event in which precipitation falls as [[ice]], due to [[atmospheric|atmosphere]] conditions. It causes damage.

===Tornado===
A [[tornado]] is a natural disaster resulting from a [[thunderstorm]]. Tornadoes are violent, rotating columns of air which can blow at speeds between {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and possibly higher. Tornadoes can occur one at a time, or can occur in large [[tornado outbreak]]s associated with [[supercell]]s or in other large areas of thunderstorm development. [[Waterspout]]s are tornadoes occurring over tropical waters in light rain conditions.

===Climate change===

[[Climate change]] can increase or decrease weather hazards, and also directly endanger property due to [[sea level rise]] and biological organisms due to [[habitat]] destruction.

===Geomagnetic storm===

[[Geomagnetic storm]]s can disrupt or damage technological infrastructure, and disorient species with [[magnetoception]].

==Flood==
A [[flood]] results from an overflow of water beyond its normal confines of a body of water such as a lake, or the accumulation of water over land areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Flood|website=Meteorology glossary|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildfire==
[[Wildfire]] is a fire that burns in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner. Wildfires can result from natural occurrences such as lightning strikes or from human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildfire|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/wildfire|website=Cambridge dictionaries online|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
[[Disease]] is a natural hazard that can be enhanced by human factors such as [[urbanization]] or poor [[sanitation]].  Disease affecting multiple people can be termed an [[outbreak]] or [[epidemic]].

In some cases, a hazard exists in that a human-made defense against disease could fail, for example through [[antibiotic resistance]].

==Multi-hazard analysis==
Each of the natural hazard types outlined above have very different characteristics, in terms of the spatial and temporal scales they influence, hazard frequency and [[return period]], and measures of intensity and impact. These complexities result in "single-hazard" assessments being commonplace, where the hazard potential from one particular hazard type is constrained. In these examples, hazards are often treated as isolated or independent. An alternative is a "multi-hazard" approach which seeks to identify all possible natural hazards and their interactions or interrelationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11069-012-0294-2 | doi=10.1007/s11069-012-0294-2 | volume=64 | title=Challenges of analyzing multi-hazard risk: a review | journal=Natural Hazards | pages=1925–1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;

Many examples exist of one natural hazard triggering or increasing the probability of one or more other natural hazards. For example, an [[earthquake]] may trigger [[landslides]], whereas a [[wildfire]] may increase the probability of landslides being generated in the future.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;  A detailed review of such interactions across 21 natural hazards identified 90 possible interactions, of varying likelihood and spatial importance.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;  There may also be interactions between these natural hazards and [[anthropic]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/EGU2014-3049.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[groundwater]] abstraction may trigger [[groundwater-related subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthgwlandsubside.html|title=Land Subsidence|work=USGS Water Science School|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective [[hazard analysis]] in any given area (e.g., for the purposes of [[disaster risk reduction]]) should ideally include an examination of all relevant hazards and their interactions. To be of most use for risk reduction, hazard analysis should be extended to [[risk assessment]] wherein the vulnerability of the built environment to each of the hazards is taken into account. This step is well developed for [[seismic risk]], where the possible effect of future earthquakes on structures and infrastructure is assessed, as well as for risk from [[Wind engineering|extreme wind]] and to a lesser extent [[Flood risk assessment|flood risk]]. For other types of natural hazard the calculation of risk is more challenging, principally because of the lack of functions linking the intensity of a hazard and the probability of different levels of damage (fragility curves).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=J.|date=2007-04-05|title=Physical vulnerability modelling in natural hazard risk assessment|url=http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/7/283/2007/|journal=Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.|volume=7|issue=2|pages=283–288|doi=10.5194/nhess-7-283-2007|issn=1684-9981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''ThinkHazard!'' is an online tool that provides an overview of the hazards from eight natural hazards (river floods, earthquakes, water scarcity, cyclones, coastal floods, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides) developed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery in partnership with other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkhazard.org/ ThinkHazard!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gfdrr.org/ Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International campaigns==
In 2000, the [[United Nations]] launched the [[International Early Warning Programme]] to address the underlying causes of vulnerability and to build disaster-resilient communities by promoting increased awareness of the importance of [[disaster risk reduction]] as an integral component of [[sustainable development]], with the goal of reducing human, economic and environmental losses due to hazards of all kinds (UN/ISDR, 2000). 

The 2006-2007 United Nations International Disaster Reduction Day theme was “Disaster reduction education begins in school”. The Foundation of Public Safety Professionals launched an international campaign with an international open essay or documentary competition.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show ''[[NOVA ScienceNow]]'' on [[PBS]]. Since 2009, Tyson hosted the weekly podcast ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]''. A spin-off, also called ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', a successor to [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1980 series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fox |title=Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.cosmosontv.com/ |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] awarded Tyson the [[Public Welfare Medal]] in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html Neil deGrasse Tyson to Receive Public Welfare Medal – Academy's Most Prestigious Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210506/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}" (February 26, 2015).

He credited Dr. Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his "first intellectual role model" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer &amp; Shepherd-Wynn 2012, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 15, 2013 |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Prodigy Astronomer |url=http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216182841/http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |deadurl=yes |publisher=Parlemagazine.com |accessdate=May 27, 2013 |archivedate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who was a faculty member at [[Cornell University]], tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] studies.&lt;ref name=Whitaker2000 /&gt; In his book, ''The Sky Is Not the Limit'', Tyson wrote:

{{quote|My letter of application had been dripping with an interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me, had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention.

Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of ''person'' I wanted to become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Standing Up in the Milky Way]] |series=[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]] |date=March 9, 2014 |network=[[National Geographic Channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[Fox Life]], et al. |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 3, 2014 |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html?_r=0 |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson chose to attend [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he majored in physics and lived in [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]]. He was a member of the [[Sport rowing|crew]] team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, [[Letterman (sports)|lettering]] in his senior year.

== Career ==
[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Tyson to serve on the [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry]] and in 2004 to serve on the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |title=American Museum of Natural History |author=(c) Copyright 2003, American Museum of Natural History |website=amnh.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022134532/http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tyson &amp; Kepler team.jpg|thumb|left|Tyson in December 2011 at a conference marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'']]
In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part ''Origins'' miniseries of the PBS ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/ |title=NOVA – Origins |year=2004 |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |author=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |first2=Donald |last2=Goldsmith |year=2004 |publisher=W.W.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [[Planetary Society]]. He was also the host of the PBS program ''[[Nova ScienceNow]]'' until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow |title=NOVA – scienceNOW |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]] symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s popular series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson in Sydney.JPG|thumb|Tyson promoting the ''Cosmos'' TV series in Australia for National Geographic, 2014]]
In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show ''StarTalk''. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [[Nerdist YouTube Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOir4aMu0vYI Nerdist Channel Sneak Peek] (March 27, 2012) from YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [[White House Student Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/students-are-stars-white-house-film-festival-n40846 |title=Students Are Stars at White House Film Festival |publisher=NBC News |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he helped revive Carl Sagan's ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' television series, presenting ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins at Howard University (2) - September 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|Tyson in conversation with [[Richard Dawkins]] at Howard University, 2010]]

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there."&lt;ref name="Rationally Speaking podcast"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Interview with Massimo Pigliucci and Julia Galef |url=http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs103-neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-he-doesnt-call-himself-an-a.html |website=Rationally Speaking podcast |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |date=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has spoken about philosophy on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of ''[[The Nerdist Podcast]]'', he stated that philosophy is "useless" and that a philosophy major "can really mess you up",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-neil-degrasse-tyson-returns-again/ |title=Nerdist Podcast: Neil deGrasse Tyson Returns Again |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Nerdist Podcast]] |last=Levine |first=Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was met with disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |title=Dear Neil deGrasse Tyson, don't be foolish about philosophy |date=June 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Chicago Now]] |last=Wall |first=James Kirk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806031740/http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |archivedate=August 6, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson Slammed For Dismissing Philosophy As 'Useless' |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[io9]] |last=Dvorsky |first=George |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328062312/http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |archivedate=March 28, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/ |title=The one thing Neil deGrasse Tyson got wrong |date=June 7, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |last=Neumann |first=Steve |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000625/http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/n|dead-url=no |archivedate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine |title=Why Neil deGrasse Tyson is a philistine |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |website=[[The Week]] |last=Linker |first=Damon |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416145135/http://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine|dead-url=no |archivedate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] later criticized him for "dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson and the Value of Philosophy |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci|dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421104308/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |archivedate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===

Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">'''New Milford''' is a fictional town in [[New Hampshire]], [[United States]]. It was the subject of a hoax article published in 2011 by ''The White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs'', which described the community as being a flourishing [[Victorian-era]] village in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] during the early 20th century. According to the article, New Milford had been incorporated in 1852 by working-class quarry workers, had enjoyed prosperity for many years, and then declined in the early 20th century, following a succession of unfortunate disasters at the quarry site, the decline of rail-based tourism, the [[Great Depression]], and the outbreak of World Wars. Research by the [[Milford, New Hampshire]], Historical Society and the New Hampshire State Library following the publication of the article led to the discovery that the article was fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cabinet.com/cabinetcabinetnews/914158-308/tale-of-milford-history.html| title=Tale of Milford History| author=Kathy Cleveland| publisher=''The Milford Cabinet''| date=March 31, 2011| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''social media newsroom''' is a company resource, set up to increase the functionality and usability of the traditional online newsroom. 

Social media newsrooms (SMNs) are intended to encourage dialogue and information sharing. Unlike online newsrooms, content is accessible to more than just journalists, but to all those with whom the company engages such as bloggers, their prospects, customers, business partners and investors. It gives these stakeholders access to news, public relations announcements, images, audio, video and other multimedia files.

In addition to posting press releases and corporate news, companies can integrate other social content from sites such as [[YouTube]], [[Flickr]] and [[Slideshow]] as well as streams from corporate [[Twitter]] accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 Communicate magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225210651/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 |date=2012-02-25 }} Hold the Front Page, Communicate magazine, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional tools for journalists such as corporate fast facts, leadership information, a multimedia library, financial information, awards and other recent media coverage are also included in an SMN.

Examples of companies effectively using social media newsrooms include [[Opel Group]], Pressat, [[First Direct]], [[MyNewsdesk]], [[Scania AB|Scania]] and [[Newport Beach]].{{cn|date=March 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">The '''Summit of Ohrid 2013''' was a planned meeting of [[political leader]]s of countries in [[South Eastern Europe]] as well as representatives of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] that would be held on 1 June in the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] city of [[Ohrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitel.com.mk/vesti/makedonija?page=2 Sitel Television - Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; On the 29th of May the [[President of the Republic of Macedonia]] [[Gjorge Ivanov]] in a press in the President's residence ''Villa Vodno'' made a statement that he would cancel the international meeting because of the forgive mixing of Balkan nationalism and prejudices.
{{Quote|Macedonia has acted fully in line with the SEECP regulations. Unfortunately, old Balkan prejudices and complexes have surfaced in the run-up to the summit and I will not let Macedonia pay the price. We have been preparing for this summit all year and we have done everything to bring all leaders from the region to the same table.|Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia}}
Before the cancellation of the Summit all of the Balkan countries political leaders were invited. At first all of the countries have accepted the invitation except Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novatv.mk/index.php?navig=8&amp;cat=2&amp;vest=3643 Nova TV - No answer from the Greek President {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Greece, the [[Bulgarian President]] [[Rosen Plevneliev]] made a statement that he also would not attend the Summit, but [[Bulgaria]] would be represented by Marin Raykov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.mk/cluster/cf789f3d37/otkaza-i-bugarskiot-pretsedatel-na-ohridskiot-samit.html Time.MK - Greek and Bulgarian President won't come to Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The last one to reject the invitation was the [[President of Albania]] [[Bujar Nishani]] who stated that he did so because leaders from the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]] weren't attending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://24vesti.mk/albanskiot-pretsedatel-nishani-nema-da-uchestvuva-na-samitot-vo-ohrid 24 Vesti - Albanian President won't be a part of the Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]] wasn't invited under the objection of [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and [[Romania]] who don't recognise the disputed country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=28&amp;nav_id=86390 B92 News - Serbia, two more countries block Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Albania]] and [[Croatia]] said that they would not attend without Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php B92 News - Macedonia "protects dignity and integrity," cancels summit]&lt;/ref&gt; EU Delegation head ''Vincent Degert'' said that the [[South-East European Cooperation Process]] is not covered in the Brussels agreement between Belgrade and Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=28&amp;nav_id=86403 B92 News - EU would like Kosovo to take part in Ohrid Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was supposed to be the 16th Meeting of Presidents of Central European States after the [[Ohrid Summit 2008]]. Among those who accepted the invitation to the meeting were: [[President of Croatia]] [[Ivo Josipović]], [[President of Moldova]] [[Nicolae Timofti]], [[President of Montenegro]] [[Filip Vujanović]], [[President of Romania]] [[Traian Băsescu]], [[President of Serbia]] [[Tomislav Nikolić]], [[President of Slovenia]] [[Borut Pahor]], [[President of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] [[Nebojša Radmanović]], the [[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey]] [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]], and also the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] [[Vuk Jeremić]] and the [[European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy]] [[Štefan Füle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.mk/cluster/22512207f7/file-ke-dojde-na-ohridskiot-samit-papuljas-seuste-ne-odgovara.html Time.MK - Ohrid Summit 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''This Is It''' was a planned [[concert residency]] by [[Michael Jackson]] which was scheduled to begin in July 2009 and end September 29, 2009 with a second leg which was scheduled to run from January 2010 through March 2010 with a total of 50 shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-tour-balloons-to-50-show-run-stretching-into-2010-20090312&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson announced This Is It at a press conference in the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], stating that it would be his final series of concerts in London. [[AEG Live]], the concert promoters, released a promotional video that took up an entire commercial break, setting a record for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Initially, only 10 concerts were announced, but following public demand, 40 more concerts were added. Ticket sales broke several records and Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement; AEG Live estimated that the first 10&amp;nbsp;dates alone would have earned Jackson approximately £50 million. 

In preparation for the concert series, Jackson had been collaborating with high-profile figures including fashion designer [[Christian Audigier]], choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] and bodybuilder [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Prior to Jackson's death in 2009, Allgood Entertainment sued Jackson for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts; the case was dismissed.

After Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either refunds to ticket holders or a special "souvenir" ticket designed by Jackson.

On May 20, it was announced that the first concert would be pushed back five days to July 13 and three other July dates would be rescheduled for March 2010. AEG Live said that the delay was necessary because more time was needed for dress rehearsals. The revised schedule called for 27 shows between July 13 and September 29, 2009, followed by a three-month break, before resuming in the new year with 23 more shows between January 7 and March 6, 2010.&lt;ref name = "new dates"/&gt; Some fans petitioned for the reversal of AEG Live's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/michael-jackson/44820 |title=Michael Jackson fans launch petition over O2 Arena postponement |publisher=''NME'' |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June, several hundred seats for each of the dates were put on sale. These seats were held back until production logistics were worked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8115638.stm |title=More Jackson tickets up for sale |publisher=BBC |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested that after the London concerts, Jackson might head to [[Australia]], [[Europe]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]] before moving on to North America. Randy Phillips, the CEO of [[AEG Live]], told The LA Times that Australia was part of Michael Jackson's international tour plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |title=Michael Jackson Planning Australian Tour Before His Death |publisher=Take 40 |date=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504000236/http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |archivedate=May 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book ''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes'', after the London concerts were finished, Jackson was planning to extend his deal with AEG Live which included new music, a potential three-picture movie deal, a series of one-off concert dates starting in China, a halftime slot at one of the future [[Super Bowl]] games to surpass his own halftime show at the [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in January 1993 and two more tours (one of which was to be a final reunion with his brothers based on a promise made to their [[Katherine Jackson|mother]] to see her sons perform together one last time before she passed away). After the deal was completed, he planned to take time off from musical entertainment and move on to (possibly) directing his own film ideas, such as making a feature-length motion picture based on his 1982 song "Thriller" and [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|the music video of the same name]]. It was also later revealed that [http://www.damienshields.com/michael-jacksons-halloween-special-that-never-was/ a yearly Halloween television special] based on his horror-themed songs, such as "Thriller" and "Ghosts", was part of Jackson's deal with AEG Live.

In [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial]], David Walgren stated another one of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson under the influence of propofol on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The ''Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital''. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they could see him perform in London.

===Songs prepared===
As shown in ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'', songs prepared for the concerts included "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]", "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", a medley of songs by [[The Jackson 5]] consisting of "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" and "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Black or White]]", "[[Earth Song]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Man in the Mirror]]". Later on, "[[Stranger in Moscow]]", "[[You Are Not Alone]]", "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]", "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]", "[[Dirty Diana]]" ,"[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)|Dangerous]]", "[[We Are the World]]", "[[Heal the World]]" and "[[Will You Be There]]" were also confirmed to have been planned for the shows. Due to the larger than usual roster of songs, as well as time constraints, Jackson would perform some songs with one verse less than he did in previous tours (such as "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Jam", "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "Black or White"). "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" was rumored to have been reserved for select concerts. On the final dates, Jackson wanted to perform a ballad called "River Ripple", written by him, with an African choir and his children. During the final concert before "Man in the Mirror", Michael was slated to premiere a song called "Best of Joy", written and recorded in 2009 prior to Jackson's death. As of 2018, the full version of "River Ripple" remains unreleased (although snippets of the song have leaked on YouTube), while "Best of Joy" was officially released in 2010 on Jackson's first posthumous album of unreleased songs, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''.

==Litigation==
In June 2009, concert promoter Allgood Entertainment, represented by Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million. He claimed that Jackson, through his manager [[Frank DiLeo]], had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with [[The Jackson 5]] and his sister [[Janet Jackson]]. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented Jackson from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094537.stm |title=Jackson sued over reunion concert |publisher=BBC |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/12/michael-jackson-sued-o2-arena|title=Michael Jackson sued for O2 arena residency|publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/12/michael-jackson-comeback-concerts |title=Michael Jackson comeback concerts in jeopardy? |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating that there was no evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11038050 | work=BBC News | title=Judge dismisses Jackson reunion claim | date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was in limbo as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/nysd/347380/ |title=AllGood Entertainment, Inc. et al v.

==Jackson's death and refunds==
{{Further|Death of Michael Jackson}}

On June 25, 2009, Jackson died after going into [[cardiac arrest]] which was caused by an overdose of [[Propofol]] and [[Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]], eighteen days before his planned first show. AEG Live, who persuaded Jackson to sign up for the shows, faced a liability of up to £300 million and an empty venue for the next nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|title=O2 arena counts cost as curtain closes on the greatest show of all|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6580748.ece|publisher=The Times|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O2 arena stated that full refunds, including all ticket service charges, would be available to those who purchased tickets through authorized agents, but that "fans will have the option to be sent the actual tickets they would have received to attend the shows in lieu of the full refunds which are being offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLA Statement&amp;nbsp;— Michael Jackson|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/inside/ucla-statement-michael-jackson.html |publisher=[[The O2 Arena]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans who bought their tickets from private sellers potentially faced difficulties. eBay recommended that purchasers contact their sellers for refunds and stated that those who used PayPal can get their money back if the purchase was made during the last 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8120412.stm |title=Refund issues over Jackson gigs |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; then later stated that "all buyers on the site will receive a full refund for their ticket purchase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8122580.stm |title=eBay will refund Jackson tickets |publisher=BBC News |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous film and album==
{{Further|Michael Jackson's This Is It|Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)}}

Following Jackson's death, AEG stated that they had over "100 hours of footage of preparations and rehearsals for the shows".&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32360110 |title=Judge OKs Jackson performance film deal |agency=Associated Press |work=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff approved a deal between film distributor [[Columbia Pictures]] and AEG Live for the former company to purchase and distribute rehearsal footage of Jackson for a film entitled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/showbiz/2009-08/06/content_8532737.htm |title=Michael Jackson film deal outlined in court papers |work=ChinaDaily.com |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-jackson11-2009aug11,0,2938755.story |author=Christopher Smith |work=[[LA Times|LA Times.com]] |title=Sony Pictures to produce Michael Jackson film |accessdate=September 21, 2009 | date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court documents, Columbia paid $60 million (£35 million) for rights to the rehearsal footage.&lt;ref name="deal6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/michael_jackson/news/13441 |title=Michael jackson This Is It film deal agreed |work=Uncut.co.uk |date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers filed in court had reportedly stated that Jackson's estate will get 90% of the profits and that AEG Live will get the remaining 10% from the film's revenue.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/11/michael-jackson-film-october-release |author=Rosie Swash |title=Michael Jackson film gets October release date |work=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Kenny Ortega]] who was also the director of the live concert. It was compiled mostly from footage that was shot as reference for production discussions and was never meant to be shown publicly.  Some of the music and vocals in the film were added from previous recordings, though most were from the live performance. The film was released on October 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="This Is It Worldwide Release Dates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |title=This Is It Worldwide Release Dates |work=[[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures.com]] |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214515/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An accompanying album to the film was also released. Titled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)|This Is It]]'', the compilation was distributed internationally on October 26, and to North America the following day. The two-disc album features music "inspired from the documentary of the same name".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/09/the-michael-jackson-new-musical-onslaught-begins.html |author=Chris Lee |title=The Michael Jackson new-music onslaught begins [Updated] |work=[[The LA Times|TheLATimes.com]] |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the album, Sony said, "Disc one will feature the original album masters of some of Michael's biggest hits arranged in the same sequence as they appear in the film" and stated that "the disc ends with two versions of the 'never-released' '[[This Is It (Michael Jackson song)|This Is It]]' [...] This song is featured in the film's closing sequence and includes backing vocals by Michael's brothers, [[The Jacksons]] and Alvin Chea of Take 6."&lt;ref name="digitalspy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a178845/new-jackson-single-lp-to-be-released.html?imdb |title=New Jackson single, LP to be released |author=Tim Parks |date=September 23, 2009 |work=[[Digital Spy|Digital Spy.com]] |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony added that the second disc will feature previously unreleased versions from Jackson's "catalogue of hits", along with a spoken word [[poem]] entitled "Planet Earth" and a 36-page commemorative booklet with "exclusive photos of Michael from his last rehearsal".&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theinsidersonginfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/2870440_Unreleased_Michael_Jackson_Song_to_be_Revealed|author=The Insider Staff |work=[[The Insider (TV series)|TheInsider.com]] |title=Unreleased Michael Jackson Song to be Revealed |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Year zero''' does not exist in the [[anno Domini]] system usually used to number years in the [[Gregorian calendar]] and in its predecessor, the [[Julian calendar]]. In this system, the year {{nowrap|[[1 BC]]}} is followed by {{nowrap|[[AD 1]]}}.  However, there is a year zero in [[astronomical year numbering]] (where it coincides with the Julian year {{nowrap|1 BC}})  and in [[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (where it coincides with the Gregorian year {{nowrap|1 BC}}) as well as in all [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu calendar]]s.

== Historical, astronomical and ISO year numbering systems ==

=== Historians ===

The ''[[Anno Domini]]'' era was introduced in 525 by [[Scythia Minor|Scythian]] monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (c. 470–c. 544), who used it to identify the years on his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. He introduced the new era to avoid using the ''[[Diocletian Era|Diocletian era]]'', based on the accession of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]], as he did not wish to continue the memory of [[Diocletianic Persecution|a persecutor of Christians]]. In the preface to his Easter table, Dionysius stated that the "present year" was "the [[consulship]] of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]] [Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior]" which was also 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]".&lt;ref name=Dionysius&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|title=DIONYSIUS EXIGUUS. LIBER DE PASCHATE SIVE CYCLUS PASCHALIS|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109025617/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; How he arrived at that number is unknown.

Dionysius did not use AD years to date any historical event. This began with the English cleric [[Bede]] (c. 672–735), who used AD years in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (731), popularizing the era. Bede also used a term similar to the English [[Anno Domini|before Christ]] once, but that practice did not catch on until very much later. Bede did not sequentially number [[Roman calendar#Months|days of the month]], weeks of the year, or months of the year. However, he did number many of the [[week#numerical|days of the week]] using a counting origin of one in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. Previous Christian histories used ''[[anno mundi]]'' ("in the year of the world") beginning on the first day of [[Creation myth|creation]], or ''anno Adami'' ("in the year of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]") beginning at the creation of Adam five days later (the sixth day of creation according to the [[Genesis creation narrative]]), used by Africanus, or ''anno Abrahami'' ("in the year of [[Abraham]]") beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the [[Septuagint]], used by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], all of which assigned "one" to the year beginning at Creation, or the creation of Adam, or the birth of Abraham, respectively. Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era.

In chapter II of book I of ''Ecclesiastical history'', Bede stated that [[Julius Caesar]] invaded Britain "in the year 693 after the building of Rome, but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord", while stating in chapter III, "in the year of Rome 798, [[Claudius]]" also invaded Britain and "within a very few days … concluded the war in … the fortysixth [year] from the incarnation of our Lord".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.html|title=Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both dates are wrong, they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD: 798 − 693 + 1 (because the years are inclusive) = 106, but 60 + 46 = 106, which leaves no room for a year zero. The modern English term "before Christ" (BC) is only a rough equivalent, ''not'' a direct translation, of Bede's Latin phrase ''ante incarnationis dominicae tempus'' ("before the time of the lord's incarnation"), which was itself never abbreviated. Bede's singular use of 'BC' continued to be used sporadically throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

Neither the concept nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of [[Roman numerals]]. The [[Babylonian numerals#Numerals|Babylonian system]] of the BC era had used the idea of "nothingness" without considering it a number, and the Romans enumerated in much the same way. Wherever a modern zero would have been used, Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use [[Latin]] number words, or the word ''nulla'' (meaning "nothing") alongside Roman numerals.&lt;ref name=Dionysius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans.

The [[Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] for zero ([[0 (number)|0]]) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century. Even then, it was known only to very few, and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century.

The ''anno Domini'' nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century, and the {{nowrap|1 January}} to {{nowrap|31 December}} historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752. The first extensive use (hundreds of times) of 'BC' occurred in ''Fasciculus Temporum'' by [[Werner Rolevinck]] in 1474, alongside years of the world (''anno mundi'').&lt;ref&gt;Werner Rolevinck, ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''anno Domini'', ''Dionysian era'', ''Christian era'', ''vulgar era'', and ''common era'' were used interchangeably between the [[Renaissance]] and the 19th century, at least in [[Latin]]. But ''vulgar era'' was suppressed in English at the beginning of the 20th century after ''vulgar'' acquired the meaning of "offensively coarse", replacing its original meaning of "common" or "ordinary". Consequently, historians regard all these eras as equal.

Historians have never included a year zero. This means that between, for example, {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|500 BC}} and {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|AD 500}}, there are 999 years: 500 years BC, and 499 years AD preceding 500. In common usage ''anno Domini'' 1 is preceded by the year 1 [[Ante Christum Natum|BC]], without an intervening year zero.&lt;ref&gt;While it is increasingly common to place ''AD'' after a date by analogy to the use of ''BC'', formal English usage adheres to the traditional practice of placing the abbreviation before the year as in Latin (e.g., {{nowrap|100 BC}}, but {{nowrap|AD 100}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the choice of calendar system (whether [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) nor the era (''Anno Domini'' or [[Common Era]]) determines whether a year zero will be used. If writers do not use the convention of their group (historians or astronomers), they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years, otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (1958), page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomers ===
{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}

In astronomy, for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation, which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation. But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates. So the year before 1 AD is designated 0, the year before 0 is &amp;minus;1, and so on.

The letters "AD", "BC", "CE, or "BCE" are omitted. So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation, 2 BC is equivalent to &amp;minus;1, etc. Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign. This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3| publisher = Univ Science Books| isbn = 1-891389-85-8| editor1-first = Sean E. | editor1-last= Urban | editor2-first = P.

==== History of astronomical usage ====
In 1627, the German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] first used an astronomical year which was to become year zero in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]''. He labeled the year ''Christi'' and inserted it between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (BC) and ''Post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages of the Sun, Moon, and planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae – Ioannes Keplerus] (1627) 191 (42), 197 (48), 203 (54), 209 (60), 215 (66), 221 (72), 227 (78).&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1702 the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae – Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (AD).&lt;ref&gt;[Jacques] Cassini, ''Tables astronomiques'' (1740), Explication et usage 5; Tables 10, 22, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISO 8601 ===

[[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems. Because it also specifies the use of the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] for all years before 1582, some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar, but it is not used with the BC/AD era. The "basic" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. Several "expanded" formats are possible: −0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six-digit versions. Earlier years are also negative four-, five- or six-digit years, which have an [[absolute value]] one less than the equivalent BC year, hence -0001 = 2 BC. Because only [[ISO 646]] (7-bit [[ASCII]]) characters are allowed by ISO 8601, the minus sign is represented by a [[hyphen-minus]].

== Other traditions ==

=== South Asian calendars ===
All eras used with [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist calendar]]s, such as the [[Saka era]] or the [[Kali Yuga]], begin with the year 0. All  these calendars use elapsed, expired, or complete years, in contrast with most other calendars which use current years. A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch, thus the number 1 cannot be used. Instead, during the first year the indication of 0 years (elapsed) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old. This is similar to the Western method of stating a person's age – people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth (but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years, not as age zero). However, if ages were specified in years and months, such a person would be said to be, for example, 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old. This is analogous to the way time is shown on a [[24-hour clock]]: during the first hour of a day, the time elapsed is 0 hours, ''n'' minutes.
