Then, the rectangle's [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] has measure 0, while its interior has  measure 1. Almost every point of the rectangle is an [[Interior (topology)#Interior point|interior point]], yet the interior has a nonempty [[complement (set theory)|complement]].]]
In [[measure theory]] (a branch of [[mathematical analysis]]), a property holds '''almost everywhere''' if, in a technical sense, the set for which the property holds takes up nearly all possibilities.  The notion of almost everywhere is a companion notion to the concept of [[measure zero]].  In the subject of [[probability]], which is largely based in measure theory, the notion is referred to as ''[[almost surely]]''.

More specifically, a property holds almost everywhere if the set of elements for which the property does not hold is a set of measure zero (Halmos 1974), or equivalently if the set of elements for which the property holds is [[conull set|conull]]. In cases where the measure is not [[Complete measure|complete]], it is sufficient that the set is contained within a set of measure zero. When discussing sets of [[real number]]s, the [[Lebesgue measure]] is assumed unless otherwise stated.

The term ''almost everywhere'' is abbreviated ''a.e.''; in older literature ''p.p.'' is used, to stand for the equivalent [[French language]] phrase ''presque partout''.

A set with '''full measure''' is one whose complement is of measure zero. In [[probability theory]], the terms ''[[almost surely]]'', ''almost certain'' and ''almost always'' refer to [[event (probability theory)|event]]s with [[probability]] 1, which are exactly the sets of full measure in a probability space.

Occasionally, instead of saying that a property holds almost everywhere, it is said that the property holds for '''almost all''' elements (though the term [[almost all]] also has other meanings).

== Definition ==

If &lt;math&gt;(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[measure space]], a property &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is said to hold almost everywhere in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mu(N) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and for &lt;math&gt;x\in X\setminus N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has property &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Another common way of expressing the same thing is to say that "almost every point satisfies &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;" or "for almost every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; holds".

It is ''not'' required that the set &lt;math&gt;\{x\in X: \neg P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; has measure 0; it may not belong to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

* If property ''P'' holds almost everywhere and implies property ''Q'', then property ''Q'' holds almost everywhere. This follows from the [[Measure (mathematics)#Monotonicity|monotonicity]] of measures.
* If &lt;math&gt; (P_n) &lt;/math&gt; is a finite or countable sequence of properties, each of which holds almost everywhere, then their conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall n P_n &lt;/math&gt; holds almost everywhere. This follows from the [[Measure (mathematics)#Measures of infinite unions of measurable sets|countable subadditivity]] of measures.
* By contrast, if  &lt;math&gt; (P_x)_{x\in \mathbf R} &lt;/math&gt; is an uncountable family of properties, each of which holds almost everywhere, then their conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall x P_x &lt;/math&gt; does not necessarily hold almost everywhere. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is Lebesgue measure on &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_x &lt;/math&gt; is the property of not being equal to &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt; P_x(y) &lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if &lt;math&gt; y \neq x&lt;/math&gt;), then each &lt;math&gt; P_x &lt;/math&gt; holds almost everywhere, but the conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall x P_x &lt;/math&gt; does not hold anywhere.

As a consequence of the first two properties, it is often possible to reason about "almost every point" of a measure space as though it were an ordinary point rather than an abstraction. This is often done implicitly in informal mathematical arguments. However, one must be careful with this mode of reasoning because of the third bullet above: universal quantification over uncountable families of statements is valid for ordinary points but not for "almost every point".

== Examples ==
{{unordered list
| If ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' is a [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable]] function and ''f''(''x'') ≥ 0 almost everywhere, then
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;}}
for all real numbers ''a'' &lt; ''b'' with equality [[iff]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere.
| If ''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is a [[monotonic function]], then ''f'' is [[derivative|differentiable]] almost everywhere.
| If ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' is Lebesgue measurable and
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f(x)| \, dx &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;}}
for all real numbers ''a'' &lt; ''b'', then there exists a set ''E'' (depending on ''f'') such that, if ''x'' is in ''E'', the Lebesgue mean
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\epsilon} \int_{x-\epsilon}^{x+\epsilon} f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;}}
converges to ''f''(''x'') as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; decreases to zero. The set ''E'' is called the Lebesgue set of ''f''.  Its complement can be proved to have measure zero.  In other words, the Lebesgue mean of ''f'' converges to ''f'' almost everywhere.
| A bounded [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]] if and only if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] almost everywhere.
| As a curiosity, the decimal expansion of almost every real number in the interval [0, 1] contains the complete text of [[Shakespeare's plays]], encoded in [[ASCII]]; similarly for every other finite digit sequence, see [[Normal number]].}}

== Definition using ultrafilters ==

Outside of the context of real analysis, the notion of a property true almost everywhere is sometimes defined in terms of an [[ultrafilter]]. An ultrafilter on a set ''X'' is a maximal collection ''F'' of subsets of ''X'' such that:
# If ''U'' ∈ ''F'' and ''U'' ⊆ ''V'' then ''V'' ∈ ''F''
# The intersection of any two sets in ''F'' is in ''F''
# The empty set is not in ''F''
A property ''P'' of points in ''X'' holds almost everywhere, relative to an ultrafilter ''F'', if the set of points for which ''P'' holds is in ''F''.

For example, one construction of the [[hyperreal number]] system defines a hyperreal number as an equivalence class of sequences that are equal almost everywhere as defined by an ultrafilter.

The definition of ''almost everywhere'' in terms of ultrafilters is closely related to the definition in terms of measures, because each ultrafilter defines a finitely-additive measure taking only the values 0 and 1, where a set has measure 1 if and only if it is included in the ultrafilter.

'''Ambiguity''' is a type of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in which several interpretations are [[wikt:plausible#Adjective|plausible]]. A common aspect of ambiguity is [[uncertainty]]. It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose [[intention|intended]] meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. (The ''[[wikt:ambi-#Prefix|ambi]]-'' part of the [[Terminology|term]] reflects an idea of "[[2 (number)|two]]", as in "two meanings".)

The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with [[vagueness]]. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.

Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.

== Linguistic forms ==
[[File:Structural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence.svg|thumb|Structural analysis of an ambiguous Spanish sentence:&lt;br /&gt; '''Pepe vio a Pablo enfurecido'''&lt;br /&gt;Interpretation 1: When Pepe was angry, then he saw Pablo&lt;br /&gt;Interpretation 2: Pepe saw that Pablo was angry.&lt;br /&gt;Here, the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation 2.]]

The [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]] of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. "Meaning" here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word "bank" has several distinct lexical definitions, including "[[Bank|financial institution]]" and "[[Bank (geography)|edge of a river]]". Or consider  "[[apothecary]]". One could say "I bought herbs from the apothecary". This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary ([[pharmacist]]) or went to the apothecary ([[pharmacy]]).

The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says "I buried $100 in the bank", most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.

Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as [[word sense disambiguation]].

The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose "[[weasel word]]s" and [[obfuscation]] are necessary to gain support from multiple [[Electoral district|constituents]] with [[mutually exclusive]] conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of [[political science]].

More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. "Good", for example, can mean "useful" or "functional" (''That's a good hammer''), "exemplary" (''She's a good student''), "pleasing" (''This is good soup''), "moral" (''a good person'' versus ''the lesson to be learned from a story''), "[[righteous]]", etc. " I have a good daughter" is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es can also create ambiguity ("unlockable" can mean "capable of being unlocked" or "impossible to lock").

[[Syntactic ambiguity]] arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax.  This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. "He ate the cookies on the couch", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.  "To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license."  This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license.  Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher.  Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Critical Thinking, 10th ed., Ch 3, Moore, Brooke N. and Parker, Richard.  McGraw-Hill, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
For the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, [[formal languages]] (such as computer [[programming language]]s), see [[Ambiguous grammar]].

[[Spoken language]] can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words. For example, "ice cream" and "I scream". Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a [[mondegreen]].

[[Semantic ambiguity]] happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase—a word or phrase that has more than one meaning.   In "We saw her duck" (example due to Richard Nordquist), the word "duck" can refer either
# to the person's bird (the noun "duck", modified by the possessive pronoun "her"), or
# to a motion she made (the verb "duck", the subject of which is the objective pronoun "her", object of the verb "saw").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to [[vagueness]].

Linguistic ambiguity [[Ambiguity (law)|can be a problem in law]], because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.

Philosophers (and other users of logic) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, "I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth", an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after "taxes" (to convey the first sense) or by changing "which" to "that" (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true – an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In [[continental philosophy]] (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. [[Martin Heidegger]] argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.[3] In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work Being and Nothingness an "essay in phenomenological ontology" [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: "as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment." Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: "Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting". Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous. Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate. Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.

In literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool. Groucho Marx's classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example: "Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know". Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" (where "blue" can refer to the color, or to sadness).

In the narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel ''The Great Gatsby''.

[[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity'. Many Christians and Jews endorse Rudolf Otto's description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.[dubious – discuss] The orthodox Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases. (The title of one of his most famous books, Orthodoxy, itself employing such a paradox.)

Metonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or jargon, for the name of the whole object (for example "wheels" to refer to a car, or "flowers" to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants). In modern vocabulary, critical semiotics,[9] metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as "sweet ride" to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humor.

== Music ==
In [[music]], pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some [[polytonality]], [[polymeter]], other ambiguous [[metre|meters]] or [[rhythm]]s, and ambiguous [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], or (Stein 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;79) any [[aspect of music]]. The [[music of Africa]] is often purposely ambiguous. To quote [[Donald Francis Tovey|Sir Donald Francis Tovey]] (1935, p.&amp;nbsp;195), "Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value."

== Visual art ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Necker cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]], an ambiguous image|thumb]]
In visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the [[Necker cube]], which can be interpreted in two ways. Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called [[multistable perception]].
The opposite of such ambiguous images are [[impossible object]]s.

Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?

== Constructed language ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Some [[Constructed language|languages have been created]] with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]]. [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]] are two related languages which have been created for this, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to [[syntax]] and [[semantic]] rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.

== Computer science ==
In computer science, the [[SI prefix]]es [[kilo-]], [[mega-]] and [[giga-]] were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 (1024, 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) contrary to the [[metric system]] in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion. This usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices (e.g. [[DRAM]]) addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense.

Subsequently, the Ki, Mi, and Gi prefixes were introduced so that [[metric prefix#Binary prefixes|binary prefixes]] could be written explicitly, also rendering k, M, and G ''unambiguous'' in texts conforming to the new standard — this led to a ''new'' ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes (necessarily indicating the new style) as to whether the usage of k, M, and G remains ambiguous (old style) or not (new style). Note also that 1 M (where M is ambiguously 1,000,000 or 1,048,576) is ''less'' uncertain than the engineering value 1.0e6 (defined to designate the interval 950,000 to 1,050,000), and that as non-volatile storage devices began to commonly exceed 1 GB in capacity (where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit), GB and TB almost always mean 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[bytes]].

== Mathematical notation ==
[[Mathematical notation]], widely used in [[physics]] and other [[science]]s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]], [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] ambiguities remain.

=== Names of functions ===
The '''ambiguity''' in the style of writing a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] should not be confused with a [[multivalued function]], which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several [[special function]]s still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:
* [[Sinc function]]
* [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the third kind|Elliptic integral of the third kind]]; translating elliptic integral form [[MAPLE]] to [[Mathematica]], one should replace the second argument to its square, see [[Talk:Elliptic integral#List of notations]]; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.
* [[Exponential integral]]&lt;ref name="irene"&gt;{{cite book |first1=M. |last1=Abramovits |first2=I. |last2=Stegun |title=Handbook on mathematical functions |page= 228 |url=http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_228.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hermite polynomial]]&lt;ref name="irene"/&gt;{{rp|775}}

=== Expressions ===
Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.
It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, &lt;math&gt;f=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if one sees &lt;math&gt;f=f(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;, there is no way to distinguish whether it means &lt;math&gt;f=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; '''multiplied''' by &lt;math&gt;(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;, or function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; '''evaluated''' at argument equal to &lt;math&gt;(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.

Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages ([[C++]] and [[Fortran]]) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The [[Wolfram Language]] used in [[Mathematica]] allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression '''f=f(x)''' is qualified as an error.

The order of operations may depend on the context. In most [[programming language]]s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, &lt;math&gt;a/bc&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;a/(bc)&lt;/math&gt;; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.
Sometimes, one uses ''italics'' letters to denote elementary functions.
In the [[scientific journal]] style, the expression
&lt;math&gt; s i n \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
means
product of variables
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, although in a slideshow, it may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;.

A comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.
If it is written &lt;math&gt;T_{mnk}&lt;/math&gt;, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables
&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.
The writing of &lt;math&gt;T_{mnk}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;T_{m,n,k}&lt;/math&gt; may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.

Subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in &lt;math&gt;F_{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
Some scientific journals use superscripts to indicate citations. If one cites reference number 6 about [[coherent addition of lasers]], the centenve may read as follows:
Practically, the number of lasers, which can be combined in such a way, does not exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
"Oh, this very powerful method allows for the combination of a million lasers,"
the reader may think. To avoid such ambiguity, [[citations]] in Wikipedia appear inside square bracket &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.
!--&gt;

=== Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions ===
&lt;math&gt;\sin^2\alpha/2&lt;/math&gt;, which could be understood to mean either &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha/2))^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^2/2&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin(\sin(x))&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\exp^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\exp(\exp(x))&lt;/math&gt; (see [[tetration]]).

&lt;math&gt;\sin^{-1}\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which by convention means &lt;math&gt;\arcsin(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, though it might be thought to mean &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\sin^{n} \alpha&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;a/2b&lt;/math&gt;, which arguably should mean &lt;math&gt;(a/2)b&lt;/math&gt; but would commonly be understood to mean &lt;math&gt;a/(2b)&lt;/math&gt; .

=== Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics ===
It is common to define the [[coherent states]] in [[quantum optics]] with &lt;math&gt;~|\alpha\rangle~ &lt;/math&gt; and states with fixed number of photons with &lt;math&gt;~|n\rangle~&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an "unwritten rule": the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and &lt;math&gt;~n~&lt;/math&gt;photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if &lt;math&gt;~|x\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and &lt;math&gt;~|p\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on [[quantum mechanics]]. Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized [[adimensional]], [[dimensionless]] variables are used. Expression &lt;math&gt; |1\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.

=== Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics ===
Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even [[dimension]], as in the case of the [[Einstein coefficients]]), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] states in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: "... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-486-40445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly confusing term is ''gain''. For example, the sentence "the gain of a system should be doubled", without context, means close to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).

The term ''intensity'' is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of [[irradiance]], [[luminous intensity]], [[radiant intensity]], or [[radiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term.

Also, confusions may be related with the use of [[atomic percent]] as measure of concentration of a [[dopant]], or [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also [[Accuracy and precision]] and its talk.

The [[Berry paradox]] arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as "definable" or "nameable". Terms of this kind give rise to [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;Russell/Whitehead, Principia Mathematica&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical interpretation of ambiguity ==
[[File:Necker cube and impossible cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]] and [[impossible cube]], an underdetermined and overdetermined object, respectively.|thumb]]
In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of [[underdetermination]]—for example, &lt;math&gt;X=Y&lt;/math&gt; leaves open what the value of ''X'' is—while its opposite is a [[self-contradiction]], also called [[inconsistency]], [[paradoxicalness]], or [[oxymoron]], or in mathematics an [[inconsistent system]]—such as &lt;math&gt;X=2, X=3&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution.

Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and [[impossible object]]s, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of [[M. C. Escher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Apostolos K. Doxiadis''' ({{lang-el|Απόστολος Κ. Δοξιάδης}}; born 1953) is a Greek writer. He is best known for his international bestsellers ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (2000) and ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009).

==Early life==
Doxiadis was born in Australia, where his father, the architect [[Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis]] was working. Soon after his birth, the family returned to Athens, where Doxiadis grew up. Though his earliest interests were in poetry, fiction and the theatre, an intense interest in mathematics led Doxiadis to leave school at age fifteen, to attend [[Columbia University]], in [[New York City|New York]], from which he obtained a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in May 1972. He then attended the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in [[Paris]] from which he got a master's degree, with a thesis on the mathematical modeling of the nervous system. His father’s death and family reasons made him return to Greece in 1975, interrupting his graduate studies. In Greece, although involved for some years with the computer software industry, Doxiadis returned to his childhood and adolescence loves of theatre and the cinema, before becoming a full-time writer.

==Work==

===Fiction in Greek===
Doxiadis began to write in Greek. His first published work was ''A Parallel Life'' (''Βίος Παράλληλος'', 1985), a novella set in the monastic communities of 4th century CE Egypt. His first novel, ''Makavettas'' (''Μακαβέττας'', 1988), recounted the adventures of a fictional power-hungry colonel at the time of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]]. Written in a tongue-in-cheek imitation of Greek folk military memoirs, such as that of [[Yannis Makriyannis]], it follows the plot of Shakespeare’s ''[[Macbeth]]'', of which the eponymous hero’s name is a Hellenized form. Doxiadis next novel, ''Uncle Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture'' (''Ο Θείος Πέτρος και η Εικασία του Γκόλντμπαχ'', 1992), was the first long work of fiction whose plot takes place in the world of pure mathematics research. The first Greek critics did not find the mathematical themes appealing, and it received mediocre reviews, unlike Doxiadis’s first two works, which were well received. Τhe novella ''The Three Little Men'' (''Τα Τρία Ανθρωπάκια'', 1998), attempts a modern-day retelling of the tale of a classic fairy-tale.

===Fiction in English===
In 1998, Doxiadis translated into English, significantly re-working, his third novel, which was published in England in 2000 as ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (UK publisher: [[Faber and Faber]]; United States publisher: [[Bloomsbury USA]].) The book became an international bestseller, and has been published to date in more than thirty-five languages. It has received the praise of, among others, Nobel Laureate [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]], British mathematician [[Sir Michael Atiyah]], critic [[George Steiner]] and psychiatrist [[Oliver Sacks]]. ''Uncle Petros'' is one of the ''[[1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://1001beforeyoudie.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110124836/http://1001beforeyoudie.com/ |date=2014-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Doxiadis’ next project, which took over five years to complete, was the graphic novel ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009), a number one bestseller on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]] and an international bestseller, already published in over twenty languages. ''Logicomix'' was co-authored with computer scientist [[Christos Papadimitriou]], with art work by [[Alecos Papadatos]] (pencils) and Annie Di Donna (color). Renowned comics historian and critic R. C. Harvey, in the ''[[Comics Journal]]'', called ''Logicomix'' “a tour-de-force” a “virtuoso performance”,&lt;ref&gt;http://classic.tcj.com/history/logicomix-a-tour-de-force/&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Sunday Times]]''’ Brian Appleyard called it “probably the best and certainly the most extraordinary graphic novel” he has read. ''Logicomix'' is one of Paul Gravett’s ''1001 Comics You Must Read Before you Die.'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/1001_comics/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre and cinema===
In the early stage of his career, Doxiadis directed in the professional theatre, in Athens, and worked as translator, translating, among other plays, [[William Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Midsummer Night’s Dream]]'', as well as [[Eugene O’Neill]]’s ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]''.

He has written two plays for the theatre. The first was a full-length shadow-puppet play ''The Tragical History of Jackson Pollock, Abstract Expressionist'' (1999), in English, of which he also designed and directed the Athens performance.&lt;ref&gt;Watch a performance, filmed by Doxiadis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJMyQ4Bkiow&lt;/ref&gt; In this play, Doxiadis realized some of his views on “epic theatre”, in other words a theatre based on storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Read his own views on the matter in an interview: http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158&amp;Itemid=94{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His second play, ''Incompleteness'' (2005), is an imaginary account of the last seventeen days in the life of the great logician [[Kurt Gödel]], which Gödel spent in a Princeton, New Jersey, hospital, refusing to eat out of fear that he was being poisoned. The play was staged in Athens, in 2006, as Dekati Evdomi Nyhta (Seventeenth Night) with the actor Yorgos Kotanidis in the role of Kurt Gödel.

Doxiadis has also written and directed two feature-length films, in Greek, ''Underground Passage'' (''Υπόγεια Διαδρομή'', 1983) and ''Terirem'' (''Τεριρέμ'', 1987). The latter won the [[CICAE]] (International Confederation of Art Cinemas) prize for Best Film in the 1988 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

===Scholarship===
Doxiadis has a lifelong interest in logic, cognitive psychology and rhetoric, as well as the theoretical study of narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Some of his published papers are reprinted here: {{cite web|url=http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D189%26Itemid%3D70 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105053729/http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=189&amp;Itemid=70 |archivedate=2012-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he organized, with mathematician [[Barry Mazur]], a meeting on the theoretical investigation of the relationship of mathematics and narrative, whose proceedings were published as ''Circles Disturbed, The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9764.html&lt;/ref&gt; Doxiadis has lectured extensively on his theoretical interests.&lt;ref&gt;http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/one-culture/apostolos-doxiadis/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasite.rhul.ac.uk/rhul/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid%3D0422442741e14f90a3cc8a098b14ab051d |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912161456/http://mediasite.rhul.ac.uk/rhul/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=0422442741e14f90a3cc8a098b14ab051d |archivedate=2011-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doxiadis’ recent work has led him to formulate a theory about the development of deductive proof in Classical Greece, which lays emphasis on influences from pre-existing patterns in narrative and, especially, Archaic Age Poetry.&lt;ref&gt;An earlier draft of a write-up of some of these ideas can be found at https://www.academia.edu/3222520/A_Streetcar_Named_among_Other_Things_Proof&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
''Uncle Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture'' was the first recipient of the Premio Peano&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subalpinamathesis.unito.it/attivita/premiopeano.php Associazione Subalpina Mathesis – Premio Peano] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119213218/http://www.subalpinamathesis.unito.it/attivita/premiopeano.php |date=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first international award for books inspired by mathematics and short-listed for the [[Prix Médicis]]. ''Logicomix'' has earned numerous awards, among them the Bertrand Russell Society Award, the Royal Booksellers Association Award (the Netherlands), the New Atlantic Booksellers Award (USA), the Prix Tangente (France), the Premio Carlo Boscarato (Italy), the Comicdom Award (Greece). It was chosen as "Book of the Year" by ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Financial Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and other publications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2352">In [[mathematics]], an '''argument''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is a specific input in the function, also known as an [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bronshtein|first1=I.N.|last2=Semendyayev|first2=K.A.|last3=Musiol|first3=G.|last4=Muehlig|first4=H.|title=Handbook of Mathematics|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin Heidelberg New York|isbn=978-3-540-72121-5|page=47|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is clear from the context which argument is meant, the argument is often denoted by the abbreviation ''arg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Aleksandrov |editor-first=A. D. |editor2-last=Kolmogorov |editor2-first=A. N. |year=1999 |title=Mathematics: Its Content, Methods and Meaning |location= |publisher=Courier Dover |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESSKAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[binary function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt; has two arguments, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, in an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[hypergeometric function]] is an example of a four-argument function. The number of arguments that a function takes is called the [[arity]] of the function. A function that takes a single argument as input (such as &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;) is called a [[unary function]]. A function of two or more variables is considered to have a [[domain of a function|domain]] consisting of [[ordered pair]]s or [[tuple]]s of argument values. The argument of a [[circular function]] is an [[angle]]. The argument of a [[hyperbolic function]] is a [[hyperbolic angle]].

A mathematical function has one or more arguments in the form of independent variables designated in the definition, which can also contain [[parameter#Mathematical functions|parameter]]s. The independent variables are mentioned in the list of arguments that the function takes, whereas the parameters are not. For example, in the [[logarithmic function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \log_b (x)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Base (exponentiation)|base]] &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is considered a parameter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11243">"'''As I was going to St Ives'''" is a traditional English-language [[nursery rhyme]] in the form of a [[riddle]]. Its [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number is 19772.

==Lyrics==
The most common modern version is:

: As I was going to St. Ives,
: I met a man with seven wives,
: Each wife had seven sacks,
: Each sack had seven cats,
: Each cat had seven kits:
: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
: How many were there going to St. Ives?&lt;ref name=Opie1997&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 376–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The following version is found in a manuscript (Harley MS 7316) dating from approximately 1730:&lt;ref name="Opie1997"/&gt;  

: As I went to St. Ives
: I met Nine Wives
: And every  Wife had nine Sacs,
: And every Sac had nine Cats
: And every Cat had nine Kittens

A version very similar to that accepted today was published in the ''Weekly Magazine'' of August 4, 1779:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|work=The Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement

|date=1779-08-04

|volume=xlv

|page=132

|title=A Simple Question

|location=Edinburgh

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: As I was going to St Ives,
: Upon the road I met seven wives;
: Every wife had seven sacks,
: Every sack had seven cats,
: Every cat had seven kits:
: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
: How many were going to St Ives?

The suggestion of [[polygamy]] (implicit in the line "I met a man with seven wives") is generally absent from the earliest publications, but is present by 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Chambers' Edinburgh Journal |date=1837-04-29 |issue=274 |page=112 |title=A Hoax Extraordinary |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Chambers |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015035107351?urlappend=%3Bseq=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of places called [[St Ives (disambiguation)|St Ives]] in England and elsewhere. It is generally thought
that the rhyme refers to [[St Ives, Cornwall]], when it was a busy fishing port and had many cats to stop the rats and mice destroying the fishing gear, although some people argue it was [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire]] as this is an ancient [[market town]] and therefore an equally plausible destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Answers==

All potential answers to this riddle are based on its ambiguity because the riddle only tells us the group has been "met" on the journey to St. Ives and gives no further information about its intentions, only those of the narrator. In modern usage, 'to meet someone on the road' may include the sense of 'passed' or 'overtook'; while the older usage may have referred exclusively to those going in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Highway Code|page=9|publisher=The Stationery Office|date=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the 'correct' answer could be stated as "at least one, the narrator plus anyone who happens to be travelling in the same direction as him or her".&lt;ref name="legend of St Ives"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of St Yves|page=76|first=Bryan|last=Gibson|publisher=Waterside Press|date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the group that the narrator meets is assumed ''not'' to be travelling to St. Ives the answer could be ''one'' person going to St. Ives: the narrator. This is the most common assumption,&lt;ref name=Opie1997/&gt; as the purpose of the riddle was most likely to trick the listener into making long winded calculations only to be surprised by the simplicity of the answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Number Theory and Its History|page=118|first=Oystein|last=Ore|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|date=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one disregards the 'trick' answer and assumes the narrator overtook the group as they were ''also'' travelling to St. Ives,&lt;ref name=Opie1997/&gt; the most common mathematical answer is 2802: 1 man, 7 wives, 49 sacks, 343 cats, and 2401 kits, plus the narrator (the sum of a [[geometric series#Formula|geometric series]], plus one).

After the riddle was published in the August 4, 1779 issue of ''The Weekly Magazine'', as described above, a subsequent edition of that journal contained the following solution, submitted by reader "Philo-Rhithmus" of Edinburgh:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|work=The Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Why the deuce do you give yourselves so much vexation,
: And puzzle your brains with a long calculation
: Of the number of cats, with their kittens and sacks,
: Which ''went'' to St Ives, on the old women's backs,
: As you seem to suppose?  {{--}} Don't you see that the cunning
: Old Querist ''went only''? {{--}} The rest were all ''coming''.
: But grant the wives ''went'' too, {{--}} as sure's they were married,

: ''Eight'' only could go, {{--}} for the rest were all ''carried''.

A similar problem is found in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (Problem 79), dated to around 1650 BC.
The papyrus is translated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The problem appears to be an illustration of an [[algorithm]] for [[multiplication|multiplying]] numbers. The sequence 7, 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; appears in the right-hand column, and the terms 2,801, 2×2,801, 4×2,801 appear in the left; the sum on the left is 7×2,801 = 19,607, the same as the sum of the terms on the right. The equality of the two geometric sequences can be stated as the equation (2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(7&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) = 7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, which relies on the coincidence 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=7.

Note that the author of the papyrus listed a wrong value for the fourth power of 7; it should be 2,401, not 2,301. However, the sum of the powers (19,607) is correct.

The problem has been [[paraphrase]]d by modern commentators as a [[story problem]] involving houses, cats, mice, and grain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript EPISODE 17 – RHIND MATHEMATICAL PAPYRUS|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode17/|work=A history of the world|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus there is no discussion beyond the bare outline stated above. The [[ancient Egyptian weights and measures#Volume|hekat]] was {{frac|1|30}} of a cubic [[cubit]] (approximately {{convert|4.8|l|lk=on|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

==In popular culture==
&lt;!-- If you are going to add items to this section PLEASE GIVE FULL DETAILS - (including years) and an in-line reference if at all possible - as otherwise it is very hard to substantiate the points later--&gt;
{{bulleted list
| It was parodied by [[Roald Dahl]] in his poetry book ''[[Rhyme Stew]]'' (1989): "As I was going to St Ives/ I met a man with seven wives/ he said: "I think it's much more fun/ than getting stuck with only one."
| In the [[1995 in film|1995 film]] ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', the rhyme is presented to the protagonists by the villain as a riddle, giving them thirty seconds to telephone him on the number "555 plus the answer" or a bomb would detonate. The protagonists initially believe the answer to be 2401, only solving for the number of kits. However, they eventually solve the riddle, calling the number 555–0001 which proves to be correct. They missed the 30-second deadline, but the bomb did not explode since the villain had not said "[[Simon Says|Simon says]]."
| The rhyme was recited by [[Mary Murphy (actress)|Mary Murphy]]'s character while caring for a cat with seven kittens in the movie ''[[A Man Alone (film)|A Man Alone]]''. Later the character played by [[Ray Milland]] who overheard the rhyme offers her the answer and Murphy's character explains that she alone was going to St. Ives.
| The rhyme was also the basis of a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' Muppet skit from the show's first season, in which the boy Muppet holding a numeral 7 sings the rhyme as a song to the girl Muppet twice (the second time, the girl is busy writing down the calculations) and finally, in keeping true to the spirit of the riddle, reveals the answer as 1 (the traditional answer), because ''he'' was going to St. Ives and the kits, cats, sacks and wives were going the other way. Then the girl turns the tables on the boy and asks how many were going the other way.  She then reveals the mathematical answer from her calculations: 1 man + 7 wives + 49 sacks + 343 cats + 2,401 kittens, which comes to 2,801. Astonished, the boy responds, "How about that?!"
| ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine used it in at least two articles over the years for the following parodies:&lt;poem&gt;
As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
Of course, the seven wives weren't his
But here in France, that's how it is&lt;/poem&gt; and &lt;poem&gt;As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
I know this sounds absurd and loony
But that poor man was [[Mickey Rooney]]!&lt;/poem&gt;
| In a post-Christmas ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'' comic strip sequence from December 1957, Pogo Possum gives Albert Alligator a book with the poem and Albert immediately gets hopelessly entangled by the riddle. Pogo's proposed solution: "Gimme the book back an' I'll give you a pair of pants to go with the suspenders you got."
| In the sixth series of [[BBC]] radio comedy ''[[John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme]]'', the fourth episode features a sketch with a [[Cornishman]] arguing with another man on a train about whether he actually has seven wives, each of whom have sacks of cats with them, on the train with him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2808">In [[financial mathematics]], the '''Black–Karasinski model''' is a [[mathematical model]] of the [[term structure]] of [[interest rate]]s; see [[short rate model]].  It is a one-factor model as it describes interest rate movements as driven by a single source of randomness.
It belongs to the class of no-arbitrage models, i.e. it can fit today's [[zero-coupon bond]] prices, and in its most general form, today's prices for a set of caps, floors or European [[swaption]]s. The model was introduced by [[Fischer Black]] and [[Piotr Karasinski]] in 1991.

==Model==

The main state variable of the model is the short rate, which is assumed to follow the stochastic differential equation (under the [[risk-neutral measure]]):

: &lt;math&gt; d\ln(r) = [\theta_t-\phi_t \ln(r)] \, dt + \sigma_t\, dW_t &lt;/math&gt;

where ''dW''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is a standard [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]]. The model implies a [[log-normal distribution]] for the short rate and therefore the [[expected value]] of the money-market account is infinite for any maturity.

In the original article by Fischer Black and Piotr Karasinski the model was implemented using a [[Binomial options pricing model|binomial tree]] with variable spacing, but a [[trinomial tree]] implementation is more common in practice, typically a lognormal application of the [[Hull–White model#Trees and lattices|Hull-White Lattice]].

==Applications==
The model is used mainly for the pricing of [[exotic option|exotic]] [[interest rate derivative]]s such as [[American option|American]] and [[Bermudan option|Bermudan]] [[bond option]]s and [[swaptions]], once its parameters have been calibrated to the current term structure of interest rates and to the prices or [[implied volatility|implied volatilities]] of [[Interest rate cap|caps]], [[Interest rate floor|floors]] or [[European option|European]] swaptions. [[Numerical method]]s (usually trees) are used in the calibration stage as well as for pricing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25339">In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''Christoffel symbols''' are an array of numbers describing a [[metric connection]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{harv|Spivak|1999}} and {{harv|Choquet-Bruhat|DeWitt-Morette|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The metric connection is a specialization of the [[affine connection]] to [[surface (topology)|surface]]s or other [[manifold]]s endowed with a [[metric tensor|metric]], allowing distances to be measured on that surface.  In [[differential geometry]], an affine connection can be defined without any reference to a metric, and many additional concepts follow: [[parallel transport]], [[covariant derivative]]s, [[geodesic]]s, etc. also do not require the concept of a metric.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Adler, Maurice Bazin, Menahem Schiffer, ''Introduction to General Relativity'' (1965) McGraw-Hill Book Company {{ISBN|0-07-000423-4}} (''See section 2.1'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, John Archibald Wheeler, ''Gravitation'' (1973) W. H,. Freeman {{ISBN|0-7167-0334-3}} (''See chapters 8-11'')&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a metric is available, these concepts can be directly tied to the "shape" of the manifold itself; that shape is determined by how the [[tangent space]] is attached to the [[cotangent space]] by the [[metric tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, ''op. cit.'' (''See chapter 13'')&lt;/ref&gt; Abstractly, one would say that the manifold has an associated ([[orthonormal]]) [[frame bundle]], with each "[[vierbein|frame]]" being a possible choice of a [[coordinate frame]]. An invariant metric implies that the [[structure group]] of the frame bundle is the [[orthogonal group]] {{math|SO(''m'',''n'')}}. As a result, such a manifold is necessarily a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Jost, ''Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis'', (2002) Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|3-540-42627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bleeker, ''Gauge Theory and Variational Principles'' (1991) Addison-Wesely Publishing Company {{ISBN|0-201-10096-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christoffel symbols provide a concrete representation of the connection of (pseudo-)[[Riemannian geometry]] in terms of coordinates on the manifold. Additional concepts, such as parallel transport, geodesics, etc. can then be expressed in terms of Christoffel symbols.

In general, there are an infinite number of metric connections for a given [[metric tensor]]; however, there is one, unique connection, the [[Levi-Civita connection]], that is free of any [[torsion tensor|torsion]]. It is very common in physics and [[general relativity]] to work almost exclusively with the Levi-Civita connection, by working in [[coordinate frame]]s (called [[Holonomic basis|holonomic coordinates]]) where the torsion vanishes. For example, in [[Euclidean spaces]], the Christoffel symbols describe how the [[Curvilinear_coordinates#Covariant_and_contravariant_bases| local coordinate bases]] change from point to point.

At each point of the underlying {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold, for any local coordinate system around that point, the Christoffel symbols are denoted {{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''i'', ''j'', ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}}. Each entry of this {{math|''n'' × ''n'' × ''n''}} [[Matrix (mathematics)|array]] is a [[real number]]. Under ''linear'' [[coordinate transformations]] on the manifold, the Christoffel symbols transform like the components of a [[tensor]], but under general coordinate transformations ([[diffeomorphism]]s) they do not.  Most of the algebraic properties of the Christoffel symbols follow from their relationship to the affine connection; only a few follow from the fact that the [[structure group]] is the orthogonal group {{math|SO(''m'',''n'')}} (or the [[Lorentz group]] {{math|SO(3,1)}} for general relativity).

Christoffel symbols are used for performing practical calculations. For example, the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] can be expressed entirely in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their first [[partial derivative]]s. In [[general relativity]], the connection plays the role of the gravitational force field with the corresponding gravitational potential being the metric tensor. When the coordinate system and the metric tensor share some symmetry, many of the {{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[0 (number)|zero]].

The Christoffel symbols are named for [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel]] (1829–1900).&lt;ref name="christoffel" &gt;{{citation|title=Ueber die Transformation der homogenen Differentialausdrücke zweiten Grades|last=Christoffel|first=E.B.|author-link=Elwin Bruno Christoffel|journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik|volume=70|pages=46–70|year=1869|url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002153882&amp;IDDOC=266356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note&lt;!--'Connection coefficient' and 'Connection coefficients' and redirect here--&gt;==
The definitions given below are valid for both [[Riemannian manifold]]s and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s, such as those of [[general relativity]], with careful distinction being made between upper and lower indices ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contra-variant and co-variant]] indices). The formulas hold for either [[sign convention]], unless otherwise noted.

[[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used in this article, with vectors indicated by bold font. The '''connection coefficients'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] (or pseudo-Riemannian connection) expressed in a coordinate basis are called ''Christoffel symbols''.

==Preliminary definitions==
Given a [[coordinate system]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}} on an {{math|''n''}}-manifold {{math|''M''}}, the [[tangent space|tangent vectors]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i = \frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial x^i}=\partial_i \mathbf{x}, \quad i=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''x'''}} is the position vector, define what is referred to as the local [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of the tangent space to {{math|''M''}} at each point of its domain. These can be used to define the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}=\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

and its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}=\left( g_{ij} \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which can in turn be used to define the dual basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i = \mathbf{e}_j g^{ji}, \quad i=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition in Euclidean space==
In [[Euclidean space]], the general definition given below for the Christoffel symbols of the second kind can be proven to be equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k{}_{ij}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}^{k}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot g^{km} \mathbf{e}_{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

Christoffel symbols of the first kind can then be found via [[Ricci_calculus#Raising_and_lowering_indices|index juggling]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kij}
=   \Gamma^m_{ij}g_{mk}
=  \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}^{m} g_{mk}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}_{k} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging, we see that:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j}=\Gamma^k{}_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{k} =\Gamma{}_{kij} \mathbf{e}^{k} &lt;/math&gt;

In words, the arrays represented by the Christoffel symbols track how the basis changes from point to point. Symbols of the second kind decompose the change with respect to the basis, while symbols of the first kind decompose it with respect to the dual basis. These expressions fail as definitions when such decompositions are not possible - in particular, when the direction of change does not lie in the tangent space, which can occur on a [[curvature | curved]] surface. In this form, it easy to see the symmetry of the lower or last two indices:

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k{}_{ij}=\Gamma^k{}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kij}=\Gamma_{kji} &lt;/math&gt;,

from the definition of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt; and the fact that partial derivatives commute (as long as the manifold and coordinate system [[Symmetry_of_second_derivatives| are well behaved]]).

The same numerical values for Christoffel symbols of the second kind also relate to derivatives of the dual basis, as seen in the expression:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}^{i}}{\partial x^j}=- \Gamma^i_{jk} \mathbf{e}^{k} &lt;/math&gt;,

which we can rearrange as:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^i_{jk} =- \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}^{i}}{\partial x^j}  \cdot \mathbf{e}_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

== General definition==
===Christoffel symbols of the first kind===
The Christoffel symbols of the first kind can be derived either from the Christoffel symbols of the second kind and the metric,&lt;ref name="ludvigsen"&gt;{{citation |last1=Ludvigsen |first1=Malcolm|title=General Relativity: A Geometrical Approach | year=1999|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab} = g_{cd} \Gamma^{d}{}_{ab}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
or from the metric alone,&lt;ref name="ludvigsen" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab}
=\tfrac12 \left(\frac{\partial g_{ca}}{\partial x^b} + \frac{\partial g_{cb}}{\partial x^a} - \frac{\partial g_{ab}}{\partial x^c} \right)
= \tfrac12\, (g_{ca, b} + g_{cb, a} - g_{ab, c}) 
= \tfrac12\, \left(\partial_{b}g_{ca} + \partial_{a}g_{cb} - \partial_{c}g_{ab}\right) \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

As an alternative notation one also finds&lt;ref name="christoffel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjeep114"&gt;{{cite book
 |first1=U. |last1=Chatterjee
 |first2=N. |last2=Chatterjee

 |page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dirkstruik"&gt;{{cite book
 |first1=D.J. |last1=Struik
 |title=Lectures on Classical Differential Geometry
 |edition=first published in 1988 Dover
 |year=1961
 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab} = [ab, c].&lt;/math&gt;
It is worth noting that {{math|[''ab'', ''c''] {{=}} [''ba'', ''c'']}}.&lt;ref name="bishopgoldberg" &gt;{{citation | last1=Bishop|first1=R.L.|last2=Goldberg|first2=| title = Tensor Analysis on Manifolds| year=1968|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christoffel symbols of the second kind (symmetric definition)===
The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are the connection coefficients—in a coordinate basis—of the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and since this connection has zero [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], then in this basis the connection coefficients are symmetric, i.e., {{math|Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} {{=}} Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ji''}}}}.&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"&gt;{{cite book
 |first1=U. |last1=Chatterjee
 |first2=N. |last2= Chatterjee
 |title=Vector &amp; Tensor Analysis
 |year=2010
 |page=480
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a torsion-free connection is often called ''symmetric''.

In other words, the Christoffel symbols of the second kind&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind" /&gt;
{{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (sometimes {{math|Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}}}} or {{math|&lt;big&gt;{&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}}&lt;big&gt;}&lt;/big&gt;}})&lt;ref name="christoffel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt; are defined as the unique coefficients such that the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \mathrm{e}_j = \Gamma^k{}_{ij}\mathrm{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;
holds, where {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on {{math|''M''}} taken in the coordinate direction {{math|e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (i.e., {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ∇&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and where {{math|e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a local coordinate ([[holonomic basis|holonomic]]) [[basis of a vector space|basis]].

The Christoffel symbols can be derived from the vanishing of the [[covariant derivative]] of the [[metric tensor]] {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
  0 = \nabla_l g_{ik}
    = \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^l} - g_{mk}\Gamma^m{}_{il} - g_{im}\Gamma^m{}_{kl}
    = \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^l} - 2g_{m(k}\Gamma^m{}_{i)l}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As a shorthand notation, the [[nabla symbol]] and the partial derivative symbols are frequently dropped, and instead a [[semicolon]] and a [[comma]] are used to set off the index that is being used for the derivative.  Thus, the above is sometimes written as
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \,g_{ik;l} = g_{ik,l} - g_{mk} \Gamma^m{}_{il} - g_{im} \Gamma^m{}_{kl} .&lt;/math&gt;

Using that the symbols are symmetric in the lower two indices, one can solve explicitly for the Christoffel symbols as a function of the metric tensor by permuting the indices and resumming:&lt;ref name="bishopgoldberg" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12g^{im} \left(\frac{\partial g_{mk}}{\partial x^l} + \frac{\partial g_{ml}}{\partial x^k} - \frac{\partial g_{kl}}{\partial x^m} \right) = \tfrac12g^{im} (g_{mk,l} + g_{ml,k} - g_{kl,m}),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|(''g&lt;sup&gt;jk&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} is the inverse of the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{math|(''g&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, defined as (using the [[Kronecker delta]], and [[Einstein notation]] for summation) {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ji&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Although the Christoffel symbols are written in the same notation as [[Classical treatment of tensors|tensors with index notation]], they are '''not''' [[tensor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  {{harv|Kreyszig|1991}}, page 141&lt;/ref&gt;
since they [[#Change of variable|do not transform like tensors under a change of coordinates]].

===Connection coefficients in a nonholonomic basis===
The Christoffel symbols are most typically defined in a coordinate basis, which is the convention followed here. In other words,  the name '''Christoffel symbols''' is reserved only for coordinate (i.e., [[holonomic basis|holonomic]]) frames. However, the connection coefficients can also be defined in an arbitrary (i.e., nonholonomic) basis of tangent vectors {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf{u}_i}\mathbf{u}_j = \omega^k{}_{ij}\mathbf{u}_k.&lt;/math&gt;
Explicitly, in terms of the metric tensor, this is&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind"&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChristoffelSymboloftheSecondKind.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12g^{im} \left( g_{mk,l} + g_{ml,k} - g_{kl,m} + c_{mkl}+c_{ml k} - c_{kl m} \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;klm&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''g&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;kl&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are the [[Commutator (ring theory)|commutation coefficients]] of the basis; that is,
:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{u}_k,\mathbf{u}_l] = c_{kl}{}^m \mathbf{u}_m&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the basis [[vector space|vector]]s and {{math|[ , ]}} is the [[Lie derivative|Lie bracket]]. The standard unit vectors in [[vector fields in cylindrical and spherical coordinates|spherical and cylindrical coordinates]] furnish an example of a basis with non-vanishing commutation coefficients. The difference between the connection in such a frame, and the Levi-Civita connection is known as the [[contorsion tensor]].

===Ricci rotation coefficients (asymmetric definition)===
When we choose the basis {{math|'''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} orthonormal: {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ ''η&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ⟨''X&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''X&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩}} then {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;mk,l&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ ''η&lt;sub&gt;mk,l&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}. This implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12\eta^{im} \left( c_{mkl}+c_{ml k} - c_{kl m} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the connection coefficients become antisymmetric in the first two indices:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc} = - \omega_{bac}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc} = \eta_{ad}\omega^d{}_{bc}\, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the connection coefficients {{math|''ω&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are called the '''Ricci rotation coefficients'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dei sistemi di congruenze ortogonali in una varietà qualunque|author=G. Ricci-Curbastro|journal=Mem. Acc. Lincei |volume=2|year=1896|pages=276–322|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ricci's coefficients of rotation|author=H. Levy|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. |volume=31|year=1925|pages=142–145|issue=3-4|url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183486405|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1925-03996-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalently, one can define Ricci rotation coefficients as follows:&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^k{}_{ij} := {{\mathbf{u}}}^k \cdot \left( \nabla_j {{\mathbf{u}}}_i \right)\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an orthonormal nonholonomic basis and {{math|'''u'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''η&lt;sup&gt;kl&lt;/sup&gt;'''''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;}} its ''co-basis''.

==Relationship to index-free notation==
Let {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} be [[vector fields]] with components {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and {{math|''Y&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}}. Then the {{math|''k''}}th component of the covariant derivative of {{math|''Y''}} with respect to {{math|''X''}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_X Y\right)^k = X^i (\nabla_i Y)^k = X^i \left(\frac{\partial Y^k}{\partial x^i} + \Gamma^k{}_{im} Y^m\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the [[Einstein notation]] is used, so repeated indices indicate summation over indices and contraction with the metric tensor serves to raise and lower indices:
:&lt;math&gt;g(X,Y) = X^i Y_i = g_{ik}X^i Y^k = g^{ik}X_i Y_k.&lt;/math&gt;

Keep in mind that {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''g&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and that {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the [[Kronecker delta]]. The convention is that the metric tensor is the one with the lower indices; the correct way to obtain {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} from {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is to solve the linear equations {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The statement that the connection is [[torsion tensor|torsion]]-free, namely that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X,Y]&lt;/math&gt;
is equivalent to the statement that—in a coordinate basis—the Christoffel symbol is symmetric in the lower two indices:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^i{}_{jk}=\Gamma^i{}_{kj}.&lt;/math&gt;

The index-less transformation properties of a tensor are given by [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullbacks]] for covariant indices, and [[pushforward (differential)|pushforwards]] for contravariant indices. The article on [[Covariant derivative#Coordinate description|covariant derivatives]] provides additional discussion of the correspondence between index-free notation and indexed notation.

==Covariant derivatives of tensors==
The [[covariant derivative]] of a vector field {{math|''V&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l V^m = \frac{\partial V^m}{\partial x^l} + \Gamma^m{}_{kl} V^k.&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant derivative of a scalar field {{math|''φ''}} is just
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \varphi = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;

and the covariant derivative of a [[covector]] field {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l \omega_m = \frac{\partial \omega_m}{\partial x^l} - \Gamma^k{}_{m l} \omega_k.&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetry of the Christoffel symbol now implies
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i\nabla_j \varphi = \nabla_j\nabla_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

for any scalar field, but in general the covariant derivatives of higher order tensor fields do not commute (see [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]]).

The covariant derivative of a type (2,0) [[tensor]] field {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l A^{ik}=\frac{\partial A^{ik}}{\partial x^l} + \Gamma^i{}_{ml} A^{mk} + \Gamma^k{}_{ml} A^{im}, &lt;/math&gt;

that is,
:&lt;math&gt; A^{ik} {}_{;l} = A^{ik} {}_{,l} + A^{mk} \Gamma^i{}_{ml} + A^{im} \Gamma^k{}_{ml}. &lt;/math&gt;

If the tensor field is [[mixed tensor|mixed]] then its covariant derivative is
:&lt;math&gt; A^i {}_{k;l} = A^i {}_{k,l} + A^{m} {}_k \Gamma^i{}_{ml} - A^i {}_m \Gamma^m{}_{kl}, &lt;/math&gt;

and if the tensor field is of type {{math|(0,2)}} then its covariant derivative is
:&lt;math&gt; A_{ik;l} = A_{ik,l} - A_{mk} \Gamma^m{}_{il} - A_{im} \Gamma^m{}_{kl}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Contravariant derivatives of tensors===
To find the contravariant derivative of a vector field, we must first transform 
it into a covariant derivative using the metric tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^l V^m = g^{il} \nabla_i V^m= g^{il} \partial_i V^m + g^{il} \Gamma^m_{ki} V^k=\partial^l V^m + g^{il} \Gamma^m_{ki} V^k&lt;/math&gt;

==Change of variable==
Under a change of variable from {{math|(''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''y&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} to {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'')}}, vectors transform as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} = \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}&lt;/math&gt;

and so
:&lt;math&gt;{\bar\Gamma}^k{}_{ij} =
\frac{\partial x^p}{\partial y^i}\,
\frac{\partial x^q}{\partial y^j}\,
\Gamma^r{}_{pq}\,
\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^r}
+ 
\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^m}\, 
\frac{\partial^2 x^m}{\partial y^i \partial y^j}  
&lt;/math&gt;

where the overline denotes the Christoffel symbols in the {{math|''y''}} coordinate system.  Note that the Christoffel symbol does '''not''' transform as a tensor, but rather as an object in the [[jet bundle]]. More precisely, the Christoffel symbols can be considered as functions on the jet bundle of the frame bundle of {{math|''M''}}, independent of any local coordinate system. Choosing a local coordinate system determines a local section of this bundle, which can then be used to pull back the Christoffel symbols to functions on {{math|''M''}}, though of course these functions then depend on the choice of local coordinate system.

At each point, there exist coordinate systems in which the Christoffel symbols vanish at the point.&lt;ref&gt;This is assuming that the connection is symmetric (e.g., the Levi-Civita connection).  If the connection has [[torsion tensor|torsion]], then only the symmetric part of the Christoffel symbol can be made to vanish.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are called (geodesic) [[normal coordinates]], and are often used in [[Riemannian geometry]].

==Applications to general relativity==
The Christoffel symbols find frequent use in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], where [[spacetime]] is represented by a curved 4-dimensional [[Lorentz manifold]] with a [[Levi-Civita connection]]. The [[Einstein field equations]]—which determine the geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter—contain the [[Ricci tensor]], and so calculating the Christoffel symbols is essential. Once the geometry is determined, the paths of particles and light beams are calculated by solving the [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic equations]] in which the Christoffel symbols explicitly appear.

In [[mathematics]], a '''classification theorem''' answers the classification problem "What are the objects of a given type, up to some equivalence?". It gives a non-redundant enumeration: each object is equivalent to exactly one class.

A few related issues to classification are the following.

*The equivalence problem is "given two objects, determine if they are equivalent".
*A [[complete set of invariants]], together with which invariants are realizable, solves the classification problem, and is often a step in solving it.
*A computable [[complete set of invariants]] (together with which invariants are realizable) solves both the classification problem and the equivalence problem.
* A [[canonical form]] solves the classification problem, and is more data: it not only classifies every class, but provides a distinguished (canonical) element of each class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22916">In [[mathematical logic]], the theory of [[infinite set]]s was first developed by [[Georg Cantor]]. Although this work has become a thoroughly standard fixture of classical set theory, it has been criticized in several areas by mathematicians and philosophers.

[[Cantor's theorem]] implies that there are sets having [[cardinality]] greater than the infinite cardinality of the set of [[natural numbers]]. Cantor's argument for this theorem is presented with one small change. This argument can be improved by using a definition he gave later. The resulting argument uses only five axioms of [[set theory]].

Cantor's set theory was controversial at the start, but later became largely accepted. In particular, there have been objections to its use of infinite sets.

== Cantor's argument ==

[[Cantor's first uncountability proof|Cantor's first proof]] that infinite sets can have different [[Cardinality|cardinalities]] was published in 1874. This proof demonstrates that the set of natural numbers and the set of [[real number]]s have different cardinalities. It uses the theorem that a bounded increasing [[sequence]] of real numbers has a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], which can be proved by using Cantor's or [[Richard Dedekind]]'s construction of the [[irrational number]]s. Because [[Leopold Kronecker]] did not accept these constructions, Cantor was motivated to develop a new proof.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben 1979, pp. 67&amp;ndash;68, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, he published "a much simpler proof … which does not depend on considering the irrational numbers."&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1891, p. 75; English translation: Ewald p. 920.&lt;/ref&gt; His new proof uses his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]] to prove that there exists an infinite set with a larger number of elements (or greater cardinality) than the set of natural numbers '''N'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;…}. This larger set consists of the elements (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…), where each ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is either ''m'' or ''w''.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben 1979, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these elements corresponds to a [[subset]] of '''N'''—namely, the element (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…) corresponds to {''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N''': &amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''}. So Cantor's argument implies that the set of all subsets of '''N''' has greater cardinality than '''N'''. The set of all subsets of '''N''' is denoted by ''P''('''N'''), the [[power set]] of '''N'''.

Cantor generalized his argument to an arbitrary set ''A'' and the set consisting of all functions from ''A'' to {0,&amp;nbsp;1}.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben 1979, pp.166&amp;ndash;167.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these functions corresponds to a subset of ''A'', so his generalized argument implies the theorem: The power set ''P''(''A'') has  greater cardinality than ''A''. This is known as [[Cantor's theorem]].

The argument below is a modern version of Cantor's argument that uses power sets (for his original argument, see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). By presenting a modern argument, it is possible to see which assumptions of [[axiomatic set theory]] are used. The first part of the argument proves that '''N''' and ''P''('''N''') have different cardinalities:
 
* There exists at least one infinite set.  This assumption (not formally specified by Cantor) is captured in formal set theory by the [[axiom of infinity]]. This axiom implies that '''N''', the set of all natural numbers, exists.
* ''P''('''N'''), the set of all subsets of '''N''',  exists. In formal set theory, this is implied by the [[axiom of power set|power set axiom]], which says that for every set there is a set of all of its subsets.
* The concept of "having the same number" or "having the same cardinality" can be captured by the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]].  This (purely definitional) assumption is sometimes known as [[Hume's principle]].  As [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] said, "If a waiter wishes to be certain of laying exactly as many knives on a table as plates, he has no need to count either of them; all he has to do is to lay immediately to the right of every plate a knife, taking care that every knife on the table lies immediately to the right of a plate.  Plates and knives are thus correlated one to one."&lt;ref&gt;Frege 1884, trans. 1953, §70.&lt;/ref&gt; Sets in such a correlation are called [[equinumerous]], and the correlation is called a one-to-one correspondence.
* A set cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with its power set. This implies that '''N''' and ''P''('''N''') have different cardinalities.  It depends on very few assumptions of [[set theory]], and, as [[John Penn Mayberry|John P. Mayberry]] puts it, is a "simple and beautiful argument" that is "pregnant with consequences".&lt;ref&gt;Mayberry 2000, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the argument:&lt;br /&gt;

::Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; be its power set. The following theorem will be proved: If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(A),&lt;/math&gt; then it is not [[onto]]. This theorem implies that there is no one-to-one correspondence between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; since such a correspondence must be onto. Proof of theorem: Define the diagonal subset &lt;math&gt;D = \{x \in A : x \notin f(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;D \in P(A),&lt;/math&gt; proving that for all &lt;math&gt;x \in A,\, D \ne f(x)&lt;/math&gt; will imply that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not onto. Let &lt;math&gt;x \in A.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x \in D \Leftrightarrow x \notin f(x),&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;x \notin D \Leftrightarrow x \in f(x).&lt;/math&gt; So if &lt;math&gt;x \in D,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \notin f(x);&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;x \notin D,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in f(x).&lt;/math&gt; Since one of these sets contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the other does not, &lt;math&gt;D \ne f(x).&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is not in the [[image]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not onto.

Next Cantor shows that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is equinumerous with a subset of &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;. From this and the fact that &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have different cardinalities, he concludes that &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; has greater cardinality than &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. This conclusion uses his 1878 definition: If ''A'' and ''B'' have different cardinalities, then either ''B'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''A'' (in this case, ''B'' has less cardinality than ''A'') or ''A'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''B'' (in this case, ''B'' has greater cardinality than ''A'').&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1878, p. 242. Cantor 1891, p. 77; English translation: Ewald p. 922.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition leaves out the case where ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous with a subset of the other set—that is, ''A'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''B'' and ''B'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''A''. Because Cantor implicitly assumed that cardinalities are [[linearly ordered]], this case cannot occur.&lt;ref&gt;Hallett 1984, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; After using his 1878 definition, Cantor stated that in an 1883 article he proved that cardinalities are [[well-ordered]], which implies they are linearly ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1891, p. 77; English translation: Ewald p. 922.&lt;/ref&gt; This proof used his well-ordering principle "every set can be well-ordered", which he called a "law of thought".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1982, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The well-ordering principle is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1982, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1895, Cantor began to regard the well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1982, p. 51. A discussion of Cantor's proof is in [[Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes]]. Part of Cantor's proof and [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]]'s criticism of it is in a reference note.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, Cantor also gave a new definition of "greater than" that correctly defines this concept without the aid of his well-ordering principle.&lt;ref name=Cantor1895&gt;Cantor 1895, pp. 483&amp;ndash;484; English translation: Cantor 1954, pp. 89&amp;ndash;90.&lt;/ref&gt; By using Cantor's new definition, the modern argument that ''P''('''N''') has greater cardinality than '''N''' can be completed using weaker assumptions than his original argument:

* The concept of "having greater cardinality" can be captured by Cantor's 1895 definition: ''B'' has greater cardinality than ''A'' if (1) ''A'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''B'', and (2) ''B'' is not equinumerous with a subset of ''A''.&lt;ref name=Cantor1895 /&gt; Clause (1) says ''B'' is at least as large as ''A'', which is consistent with our definition of "having the same cardinality". Clause (2) implies that the case where ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous with a subset of the other set is false. Since clause (2) says that ''A'' is not at least as large as ''B'', the two clauses together say that ''B'' is larger (has greater cardinality) than ''A''.
* The power set &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; has greater cardinality than &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; which implies that ''P''('''N''') has greater cardinality than '''N'''. Here is the proof:
{{plainlist|indent=2}}
* (1) Define the subset &lt;math&gt;P_1 = \{\,y \in P(A): \exists x \in A\,(y = \{x\})\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;  Define &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \{x\},&lt;/math&gt; which maps &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;P_1.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;f(x_1) = f(x_2)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2, \, f&lt;/math&gt; is a one-to-one correspondence from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_1.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is equinumerous with a subset of &lt;math&gt;P(A).&lt;/math&gt;
* (2) Using [[proof by contradiction]], assume that &lt;math&gt;A_1,&lt;/math&gt; a subset of &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; is equinumerous with &lt;math&gt;P(A)\,.&lt;/math&gt; Then there is a one-to-one correspondence &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(A).&lt;/math&gt; Define &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(A)\text{:}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \in A_1,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h(x) = g(x);&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \in A \setminus A_1,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h(x) = \{ \, \}.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;P(A), \, h&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;P(A),&lt;/math&gt; contradicting the theorem above stating that a function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is not onto. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is not equinumerous with a subset of &lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt;
{{endplainlist}}

Besides the axioms of infinity and power set, the axioms of [[Axiom of separation|separation]], [[Axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], and [[Axiom of pairing|pairing]] were used in the modern argument. For example, the axiom of separation was used to define the diagonal subset &lt;math&gt;D,&lt;/math&gt; the axiom of extensionality was used to prove &lt;math&gt;D \ne f(x),&lt;/math&gt; and the axiom of pairing was used in the definition of the subset &lt;math&gt;P_1.&lt;/math&gt;

== Reception of the argument ==

Initially, Cantor's theory was controversial among mathematicians and (later) philosophers. As [[Leopold Kronecker]] claimed: "I don't know what predominates in Cantor's theory – philosophy or theology, but I am sure that there is no mathematics there".{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Many mathematicians agreed with Kronecker that the completed infinite may be part of [[philosophy]] or [[theology]], but that it has no proper place in mathematics. Logician {{Harvard citations|txt = yes|last = Hodges|first = Wilfrid|authorlink = Wilfrid Hodges|year = 1998}} has commented on the energy devoted to refuting this "harmless little argument" (i.e. [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]) asking, "what had it done to anyone to make them angry with it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Wilfrid | last = Hodges | author-link = Wilfred Hodges | year = 1998 | title = An Editor Recalls Some Hopeless Papers | periodical = The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 | jstor = 421003 | doi = 10.2307/421003 | publisher = Association for Symbolic Logic| citeseerx = 10.1.1.27.6154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also taken issue with Cantor's proof regarding the cardinality of the power set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Perez |first = Juan A.|eprint=1002.4433 |title=Addressing mathematical inconsistency: Cantor and Gödel refuted |year=2010|class = math.GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zenkin|first1=Alexander|title=Cantor's Diagonal Argument: A New Aspect|url=http://www.ccas.ru/alexzen/papers/CANTOR-2003/Zenkin%20BSL-2.pdf|website=Dorodnitsyn Computing Center|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematician [[Solomon Feferman]] has referred to Cantor's theories as “simply not relevant to everyday mathematics.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolchover|first1=Natalie|title=Dispute over Infinity Divides Mathematicians|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/infinity-logic-law/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Cantor, the notion of infinity was often taken as a useful abstraction which helped mathematicians reason about the finite world; for example the use of infinite limit cases in calculus.  The infinite was deemed to have at most a potential existence, rather than an actual existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alexander | last = Zenkin | year = 2004 | title = Logic Of Actual Infinity And G. Cantor's Diagonal Proof Of The Uncountability Of The Continuum | periodical = The Review of Modern Logic | volume = 9 | issue = 30 | pages = 27–80 | url = http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.rml/1203431978}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Actual infinity does not exist. What we call infinite is only the endless possibility of creating new objects no matter how many exist already".&lt;ref&gt;([[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] quoted from Kline 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s views on the subject can be paraphrased as: 'Infinity is nothing more than a figure of speech which helps us talk about limits. The notion of a completed infinity doesn't belong in mathematics'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunham|first1=William|title=Journey through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics|publisher=Penguin|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the only access we have to the infinite is through the notion of limits, and hence, we must not treat infinite sets as if they have an existence exactly comparable to the existence of finite sets.

Cantor's ideas ultimately were largely accepted, strongly supported by [[David Hilbert]], amongst others. Hilbert predicted: "No one will drive us from the paradise which Cantor created for us".&lt;ref&gt;(Hilbert, 1926)&lt;/ref&gt; To which [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] replied "if one person can see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why should not another see it as a joke?"&lt;ref&gt;(RFM V. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; The rejection of Cantor's infinitary ideas influenced the development of schools of mathematics such as [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]].

== Objection to the axiom of infinity ==
{{further information|Finitism}}

A common objection to Cantor's theory of infinite number involves the [[axiom of infinity]] (which is, indeed, an axiom and not a [[logical truth]]).  Mayberry has noted that "… the set-theoretical axioms that sustain modern mathematics are self-evident in differing degrees. One of them—indeed, the most important of them, namely Cantor's Axiom, the so-called Axiom of Infinity—has scarcely any claim to self-evidence at all …"&lt;ref&gt;Mayberry 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection is that the use of infinite sets is not adequately justified by analogy to finite sets. [[Hermann Weyl]] wrote:
{{quote|… classical logic was abstracted from the mathematics of finite sets and their subsets …. Forgetful of this limited origin, one afterwards mistook that logic for something above and prior to all mathematics, and finally applied it, without justification, to the mathematics of infinite sets. This is the Fall and original sin of [Cantor's] set theory …."&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The difficulty with finitism is to develop foundations of mathematics using finitist assumptions, that incorporates what everyone would reasonably regard as mathematics (for example, that includes [[real analysis]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4239">A '''corollary''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒr|ə|ˌ|l|ɛr|i}} {{respell|KORR|ə|lerr|ee}}, {{IPAc-en|uk|k|ɒ|ˈ|r|ɒ|l|ər|i}} {{respell|korr|OL|ər|ee}}) is a statement that [[logical consequence|follows readily]] from a previous statement.

==Overview==
In [[mathematics]], a corollary is a [[theorem]] connected by a short proof to an existing theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1176|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''corollary'', rather than ''[[proposition]]'' or ''theorem'', is intrinsically subjective. Proposition ''B'' is a corollary of proposition ''A'' if ''B'' can be readily deduced from ''A'' or is self-evident from its proof. The importance of the corollary is often considered secondary to that of the initial theorem; ''B'' is unlikely to be termed a corollary if its mathematical consequences are as significant as those of ''A''. Sometimes a corollary has a proof that explains the derivation; sometimes the derivation is considered self-evident.

==Peirce's theory of deductive reasoning&lt;!--'Peirce's theory of deductive reasoning' redirects here--&gt;==
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] held that the most important division of kinds of [[deductive reasoning]] is that between corollarial and theorematic. He argued that, while finally all deduction depends in one way or another on mental experimentation on schemata or diagrams,&lt;ref name=minute&gt;Peirce, C. S., from section dated 1902 by editors in the "Minute Logic" manuscript, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 4, paragraph 233, quoted in part in "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/corollarial.html Corollarial Reasoning]" in the ''Commons Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', 2003–present, Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; still in corollarial deduction "it is only necessary to imagine any case in which the premises are true in order to perceive immediately that the conclusion holds in that case",  whereas theorematic deduction "is deduction in which it is necessary to experiment in the imagination upon the image of the premise in order from the result of such experiment to make corollarial deductions to the truth of the conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., the 1902 Carnegie Application, published in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'', Carolyn Eisele, editor, also transcribed by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]], see &lt;!-- NEXT TWO HYPHENS IN TEXT ARE NEEDED FOR BROWSER SEARCH AT LINKED SITE --&gt;"From Draft A – MS L75.35–39" in [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-06.htm#m19 Memoir 19] (once there, scroll down).&lt;/ref&gt; He held that corollarial deduction matches Aristotle's conception of direct demonstration, which Aristotle regarded as the only thoroughly satisfactory demonstration, while theorematic deduction (A) is the kind more prized by mathematicians, (B) is peculiar to mathematics,&lt;ref name=minute/&gt; and (C) involves in its course the introduction of a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] or at least a definition uncontemplated in the thesis (the proposition that is to be proved); in remarkable cases that definition is of an abstraction that "ought to be supported by a proper postulate."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., 1901 manuscript "On the Logic of Drawing History from Ancient Documents, Especially from Testimonies', ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' v. 2, see p. 96. See quote in "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/corollarial.html Corollarial Reasoning]" in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4867">{{short description|mathematical notion of infinitesimal difference}}
In [[mathematics]], '''differential''' refers to [[infinitesimal]] differences or to the [[derivative]]s of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/differential|title=differential - Definition of differential in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in various branches of mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[differential geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]].

==Basic notions==
* In [[calculus]], the [[differential of a function|differential]] represents a change in the [[linearization]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]].
** The [[total differential]] is its generalization for functions of multiple variables.
* In traditional approaches to calculus, the [[differential (infinitesimal)|differentials]] (e.g. ''dx'', ''dy'', ''dt'', etc.) are interpreted as [[infinitesimal]]s.  There are several methods of defining infinitesimals rigorously, but it is sufficient to say that an infinitesimal number is smaller in absolute value than any positive real number, just as an infinitely large number is larger than any real number.
* The [[Total derivative|differential]] is another name for the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[partial derivative]]s of a function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (especially when this [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is viewed as a [[linear map]]).
* More generally, the [[Pushforward (differential)|differential]] or ''[[Pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]'' refers to the derivative of a map between [[smooth manifold]]s and the pushforward operations it defines. The differential is also used to define the dual concept of [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]].
* [[Stochastic calculus]] provides a notion of [[stochastic differential]] and an associated calculus for [[stochastic process]]es.
* The [[integrator]] in a [[Stieltjes integral]] is represented as the differential of a function.  Formally, the differential appearing under the integral behaves exactly as a differential: thus, the [[integration by substitution]] and [[integration by parts]] formulae for Stieltjes integral correspond, respectively, to the [[chain rule]] and [[product rule]] for the differential.

==Differential geometry==
The notion of a differential motivates several concepts in [[differential geometry]] (and [[differential topology]]).
*The [[Pushforward (differential)|differential (Pushforward)]] of a map between manifolds.
*[[Differential form]]s provide a framework which accommodates multiplication and differentiation of differentials.
*The [[exterior derivative]] is a notion of differentiation of differential forms which generalizes the [[Total derivative|differential]] of a function (which is a [[differential 1-form]]).
*[[Pullback (differential geometry)|Pullback]] is, in particular, a geometric name for the [[chain rule]] for composing a map between manifolds with a differential form on the target manifold.
*[[Covariant derivative|Covariant derivatives or differentials]] provide a general notion for differentiating of [[vector field]]s and [[tensor field]]s on a manifold, or, more generally, sections of a [[vector bundle]]: see [[Connection (vector bundle)]]. This ultimately leads to the general concept of a [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]].

==Algebraic geometry==
Differentials are also important in [[algebraic geometry]], and there are several important notions.
* [[Abelian differential]]s usually refer to differential one-forms on an [[algebraic curve]] or [[Riemann surface]].
* [[Quadratic differential]]s (which behave like "squares" of abelian differentials) are also important in the theory of Riemann surfaces.
* [[Kähler differential]]s provide a general notion of differential in algebraic geometry.

==Other meanings==
The term ''differential'' has also been adopted in homological algebra and algebraic topology, because of the role the exterior derivative plays in de Rham cohomology: in a [[cochain complex]] &lt;math&gt;(C_\bullet, d_\bullet)&lt;/math&gt;, the maps (or ''coboundary operators'') ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are often called differentials. Dually, the boundary operators in a chain complex are sometimes called ''codifferentials''.

The properties of the differential also motivate the algebraic notions of a ''[[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]'' and a ''[[differential algebra]]''.

==Definition==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">'''French mathematical seminars''' have been an important type of institution combining research and exposition, active since the beginning of the twentieth century. 

From 1909 to 1937, the [[Séminaire Hadamard]] has gathered many participants (f. i. [[André Weil]]) around the presentation of international research papers and work in progress. The [[Séminaire Julia]] focussed on yearly themes and impulsed the Bourbaki movement. The [[Séminaire Nicolas Bourbaki]] is the most famous, but is atypical in a number of ways: it attempts to cover, if selectively, the whole of [[pure mathematics]], and its talks are now, by convention, reports and surveys on research by someone not directly involved. More standard is a working group organised around a specialist area, with research talks given and written up 'from the horse's mouth'.

Historically speaking, the [[Séminaire Cartan]] of the late 1940s and early 1950s, around [[Henri Cartan]],  was one of the most influential. Publication in those days was by means of the duplicated ''exemplaire'' (limited distribution and not peer-reviewed). The seminar model was tested, almost to destruction, by the SGA series of [[Alexander Grothendieck]].

==Notable seminars==

* Séminaire Bourbaki, still current, general; [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]
* Séminaire Brelot-Choquet-Deny (from 1957), [[potential theory]]; [[Marcel Brelot]], [[Gustave Choquet]], [[Jacques Deny]]
* Séminaire Cartan, [[homological algebra]], [[sheaf theory]], [[several complex variables]]; [[Henri Cartan]] and his students

In [[mathematics]], and in particular, [[algebra]], a '''generalized inverse''' of an element ''x'' is an element ''y'' that has some properties of an [[inverse element]] but not necessarily all of them.  Generalized inverses can be defined in any [[mathematical structure]] that involves [[Associative property|associative]] multiplication, that is, in a [[semigroup]].  This article describes generalized inverses of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, given a matrix &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}&lt;/math&gt; and a matrix &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if it satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt; AA^\mathrm{g}A = A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=vii,20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of constructing a generalized inverse of a matrix is to obtain a matrix that can serve as an inverse in some sense for a wider class of matrices than invertible matrices.  A generalized inverse exists for an arbitrary matrix, and when a matrix has a [[#Motivation|regular inverse]], this inverse is its unique generalized inverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation == &lt;!-- [[Regular inverse]] links here.  Please do not change. --&gt;
Consider the [[System of linear equations|linear system]]

:&lt;math&gt;Ax = y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix and &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal R(A)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[column space]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[nonsingular]] (which implies &lt;math&gt;n = m&lt;/math&gt;) then &lt;math&gt;x = A^{-1}y&lt;/math&gt; will be the solution of the system.  Note that, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, then

:&lt;math&gt;AA^{-1}A = A.&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is rectangular (&lt;math&gt;n \neq m&lt;/math&gt;), or square and singular. Then we need a right candidate &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal R(A)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;AGy = y.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;Gy&lt;/math&gt; is a solution of the linear system &lt;math&gt;Ax = y&lt;/math&gt;. 
Equivalently, we need a matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;AGA = A.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence we can define the '''generalized inverse''' or '''g-inverse''' as follows:  Given an &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;AGA = A.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=vii,20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; has been termed a '''regular inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by some authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The Penrose conditions define different generalized inverses for &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}:&lt;/math&gt;

# &lt;math&gt; A A^\mathrm{g} A = A &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{g} A A^\mathrm{g} = A^\mathrm{g} &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \left(A A^\mathrm{g}\right)^* = A A^\mathrm{g} &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \left(A^\mathrm{g} A\right)^* = A^\mathrm{g} A, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{}^*&lt;/math&gt; indicates conjugate transpose.  If &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the first condition, then it is a '''generalized inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If it satisfies the first two conditions, then it is a '''reflexive generalized inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If it satisfies all four conditions, then it is the '''pseudoinverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|Meyer|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=20,28,51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A pseudoinverse is sometimes called the '''[[Moore–Penrose inverse]]''', after the pioneering works by [[E. H. Moore]] and [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|Meyer|1991|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

When &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is non-singular, any generalized inverse &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{g} = A^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; and is unique, but in all other cases, there are an infinite number of matrices that satisfy condition (1).  However, the Moore–Penrose inverse is unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other kinds of generalized inverse:
* [[One-sided inverse]] (right inverse or left inverse)
** Right inverse:  If the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \textrm{rank} (A) = n&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{R}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; called the '''right inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; A A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = I_n &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; [[identity matrix]].
** Left inverse:  If the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{rank}(A) = m&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; called the '''left inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1} A = I_m &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_m&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;m \times m&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Bott–Duffin inverse]]
* [[Drazin inverse]]

== Examples ==
=== Reflexive generalized inverse ===
Let

: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
    7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9
  \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
  G = \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{5}{3} &amp;  \frac{2}{3} &amp; 0 \\[4pt]
     \frac{4}{3} &amp; -\frac{1}{3} &amp; 0 \\[4pt]
               0 &amp;            0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\det(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is singular and has no regular inverse.  However, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; satisfy conditions (1) and (2), but not (3) or (4).  Hence, &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; is a reflexive generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.

=== One-sided inverse ===
Let

: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
  \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
  A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{17}{18} &amp;  \frac{8}{18} \\[4pt]
    -\frac{2}{18}  &amp;  \frac{2}{18} \\[4pt]
     \frac{13}{18} &amp; -\frac{4}{18}
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is not square, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; has no regular inverse.  However, &lt;math&gt; A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; is a right inverse of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.  The matrix &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; has no left inverse.

== Construction ==
The following characterizations are easy to verify:
{{ordered list
| A right inverse of a [[square matrix|non-square matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = A^\mathsf{T} \left(A A^\mathsf{T}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, provided ''A'' has full row rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| A left inverse of a non-square matrix &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1} = \left(A^\mathsf{T}A\right)^{-1} A^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, provided ''A'' has full column rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| If &lt;math&gt;A = BC&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rank factorization]],  then &lt;math&gt;G = C_\mathrm{R}^{-1} B_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a g-inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{R}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a right inverse of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is left inverse of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
| If &lt;math&gt;A = P\begin{bmatrix}I_r &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} Q&lt;/math&gt; for any non-singular matrices &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G = Q^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}I_r &amp; U \\ W &amp; V\end{bmatrix} P^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse  of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;U, V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.
|  Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be of rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, let
: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}B &amp; C\\ D &amp; E\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{r \times r}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-singular submatrix of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
: &lt;math&gt;G = \begin{bmatrix} B^{-1} &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
| Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have [[singular-value decomposition]] &lt;math&gt;U \boldsymbol{\Sigma} V^*&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; is the conjugate transpose of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;). Then the pseudoinverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is
: &lt;math&gt;A^+ = V \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^+ U^*&lt;/math&gt;

where the diagonal matrix {{math|'''Σ'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the pseudoinverse of {{math|'''Σ'''}}, which is formed by replacing every non-zero diagonal entry by its [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] and transposing the resulting matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985|pp=421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Uses ==

Any generalized inverse can be used to determine whether a [[system of linear equations]] has any solutions, and if so to give all of them. If any solutions exist for the ''n'' × ''m'' linear system

:&lt;math&gt;Ax = b&lt;/math&gt;,

with vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of unknowns and vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of constants, all solutions are given by 

:&lt;math&gt;x = A^\mathrm{g}b + \left[I - A^\mathrm{g}A\right]w&lt;/math&gt;,

parametric on the arbitrary vector &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; is any generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Solutions exist if and only if &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}b&lt;/math&gt; is a solution, that is, if and only if &lt;math&gt;AA^\mathrm{g}b = b&lt;/math&gt;. If ''A'' has full column rank, the bracketed expression in this equation is the zero matrix and so the solution is unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transformation consistency properties ==

In practical applications it is necessary to identify the class of matrix transformations that must be preserved by a generalized inverse. For example, the Moore-Penrose inverse, &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{P}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving unitary matrices ''U'' and ''V'':

:&lt;math&gt;(UAV)^\mathrm{P} = V A^\mathrm{P} U^*&lt;/math&gt;.

The Drazin inverse, &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;  satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to similarity transformations involving a nonsingular matrix ''S'':

:&lt;math&gt;\left(SAS^{-1}\right)^\mathrm{P} = S A^\mathrm{D} S^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Unit-Consistent (UC) inverse,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Uhlmann|first= J.K.|title=A Generalized Matrix Inverse that is Consistent with Respect to Diagonal Transformations|series=SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis|year=2018|volume=239:2|pages=781–800}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{U}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving nonsingular diagonal matrices ''D'' and ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;(DAE)^\mathrm{U} = E^{-1} A^\mathrm{U} D^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The fact that the Moore-Penrose inverse provides consistency with respect to rotations (which are orthonormal transformations) explains its widespread use in physics and other applications in which Euclidean distances must be preserved. The UC inverse, by contrast, is applicable when system behavior is expected to be invariant with respect to the choice of units on different state variables, e.g., miles versus kilometers.

{{other uses|Geometric algebra (disambiguation)}}
'''''Geometric Algebra''''' is a book written by [[Emil Artin]] and published by [[Interscience Publishers]], New York, in 1957. It was republished in 1988 in the Wiley Classics series ({{ISBN|0-471-60839-4}}).

In 1962 ''Algèbra Géométrique'', translation into French by M. Lazard, was published by Gauthier-Villars, and reprinted in 1996. ({{ISBN|2-87647-089-6}}) In 1968 a translation into Italian was published in Milan by Feltrinelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{mr|id=0256245}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 a translation into Russian was published in Moscow by Nauka&lt;ref&gt;{{mr|id=0242847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long anticipated as the sequel to ''[[Moderne Algebra]]'' (1930), which [[Bartel van der Waerden]] published as his version of notes taken in a course with Artin, ''Geometric Algebra'' is a research monograph suitable for graduate students studying mathematics. From the Preface:
:Linear algebra, topology, differential and algebraic geometry are the indispensable tools of the mathematician of our time. It is frequently desirable to devise a course of geometric nature which is distinct from these great lines of thought and which can be presented to beginning graduate students or even to advanced undergraduates. The present book has grown out of lecture notes for a course of this nature given a New York University in 1955. This course centered around the foundations of affine geometry, the geometry of quadratic forms and the structure of the general linear group. I felt it necessary to enlarge the content of these notes by including projective and [[symplectic geometry]] and also the structure of the symplectic and [[orthogonal group]]s.

The book is illustrated with six [[geometric configuration]]s in chapter 2, which retraces the path from geometric to [[field axioms]] previously explored by [[Karl von Staudt]] and [[David Hilbert]].

==Contents==
Chapter one is titled "Preliminary Notions". The ten sections explicate notions of [[set theory]], [[vector space]]s, [[homomorphism]]s, [[duality (linear algebra)|duality]], [[linear equation]]s, [[group theory]], [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], [[ordered field]]s and [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]]s. On page vii Artin says "Chapter I should be used mainly as a reference chapter for the proofs of certain isolated theorems."

[[File:Pappus-aff.svg |right|thumb|300px|Pappus's hexagon theorem holds if and only if ''k'' is commutative]]
Chapter two is titled "Affine and Projective Geometry". Artin posits this challenge to generate algebra (a field ''k'') from geometric axioms:
:Given a plane geometry whose objects are the elements of two sets, the set of points and the set of lines; assume that certain axioms of a geometric nature are true. Is it possible to find a field ''k'' such that the points of our geometry can be described by coordinates from ''k'' and the lines by linear equations ?
The [[parallel lines#Reflexive variant|reflexive variant of parallelism]] is invoked: parallel lines have either all or none of their points in common. Thus a line is parallel to itself.

Axiom 1 requires a unique line for each pair of distinct points, and a unique point of intersection of non-parallel lines. Axiom 2 depends on a line and a point; it requires a unique parallel ''to'' the line and ''through'' the point. Axiom 3 requires three non-collinear points. Axiom 4a requires a translation to move any point to any other. Axiom 4b requires a dilation at ''P'' to move ''Q'' to ''R'' when the three points are [[collinear]].

Artin writes the line through ''P'' and ''Q'' as ''P'' + ''Q''. To define a ''dilation'' he writes, "Let two distinct points ''P'' and ''Q'' and their images ''P''′ and ''Q''′ be given." To suggest the role of [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] in geometry, a dilation is specified by this property: "If ''l''′ is the line parallel to ''P'' + ''Q'' which passes through ''P''′, then ''Q''′ lies on ''l''′." Of course, if ''P''′ ≠ ''Q''′, then this condition implies ''P'' + ''Q'' is parallel to ''P''′ + ''Q''′, so that the dilation is an [[affine transformation]].

The dilations with no [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s are [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s, and the group of translations ''T'' is shown to be an [[invariant subgroup]] of the group of dilations. 
For a dilation ''σ'' and a point ''P'', the ''trace'' is ''P'' + ''σP''. The mappings ''T'' → ''T'' that are trace-preserving homomorphisms are the elements of ''k''. First ''k'' is shown to be an [[ring (mathematics)|associative ring with 1]], then a [[skew field]].

Conversely, there is an [[affine geometry]] based on any given skew field ''k''. Axioms 4a and 4b are equivalent to [[Desargues' theorem]]. When [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]] holds in the affine geometry, ''k'' is [[commutative property|commutative]] and hence a field.

Chapter three is titled "Symplectic and Orthogonal Geometry". It begins with metric structures on vector spaces before defining symplectic and orthogonal geometry and describing their common and special features. There are sections on geometry over [[finite field]]s and over ordered fields.

Chapter four is on [[general linear group]]s. First there is [[Jean Dieudonne]]'s theory of [[determinant]]s over "non-commutative fields" ([[division ring]]s). Artin describes GL(''n, k'') group structure. More details are given about vector spaces over finite fields.

Chapter five is "The Structure of Sympletic and Orthogonal Groups". It includes sections on [[elliptic space]]s, [[Clifford algebra]], and spinorial norm.

[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (ε = 1/ω)]]

In [[mathematics]], '''infinitesimals''' are things so small that there is no way to measure them. The insight with exploiting infinitesimals was that entities could still retain certain specific properties, such as [[angle]] or [[slope]], even though these entities were quantitatively small.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/#1&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''infinitesimal'' comes from a 17th-century [[New Latin|Modern Latin]] coinage ''infinitesimus'', which originally referred to the "[[Infinity|infinite]][[Ordinal number (linguistics)|-th]]" item in a sequence.  
Infinitesimals are a basic ingredient in the procedures of infinitesimal [[calculus]] as developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], including the [[law of continuity]] and the [[transcendental law of homogeneity]]. In common speech, an infinitesimal object is an object that is smaller than any feasible measurement, but not zero in size—or, so small that it cannot be distinguished from zero by any available means. Hence, when used as an adjective, "infinitesimal" means "extremely small".  To give it a meaning, it usually must be compared to another infinitesimal object in the same context (as in a [[derivative]]).  Infinitely many infinitesimals are summed to produce an [[integral]].

The concept of infinitesimals was originally introduced around 1670 by either [[Nicolaus Mercator]] or [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

I. SCIAMVS 2 (2001), 9–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In his formal published treatises, Archimedes solved the same problem using the [[method of exhaustion]].  The 15th century saw the work of [[Nicholas of Cusa]], further developed in the 17th century by [[Johannes Kepler]], in particular calculation of area of a circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon. [[Simon Stevin]]'s work on decimal representation of all numbers in the 16th century prepared the ground for the real continuum. [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s method of indivisibles led to an extension of the results of the classical authors.  The method of indivisibles related to geometrical figures as being composed of entities of [[codimension]] 1. [[John Wallis]]'s infinitesimals differed from indivisibles in that he would decompose geometrical figures into infinitely thin building blocks of the same dimension as the figure, preparing the ground for general methods of the integral calculus.  He exploited an infinitesimal denoted [[1/∞]] in area calculations.

The use of infinitesimals by Leibniz relied upon heuristic principles, such as the law of continuity: what succeeds for the finite numbers succeeds also for the infinite numbers and vice versa; and the transcendental law of homogeneity that specifies procedures for replacing expressions involving inassignable quantities, by expressions involving only assignable ones. The 18th century saw routine use of infinitesimals by mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] exploited infinitesimals both in defining [[continuous function|continuity]] in his ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', and in defining an early form of a [[Dirac delta function]].  As Cantor and Dedekind were developing more abstract versions of Stevin's continuum, [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]] wrote a series of papers on infinitesimal-enriched continua based on growth rates of functions.  Du Bois-Reymond's work inspired both [[Émile Borel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]].  Borel explicitly linked du Bois-Reymond's work to Cauchy's work on rates of growth of infinitesimals.  Skolem developed the first non-standard models of arithmetic in 1934.  A mathematical implementation of both the law of continuity and infinitesimals was achieved by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1961, who developed [[non-standard analysis]] based on earlier work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] in 1948 and [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  The [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]] implement an infinitesimal-enriched continuum and the [[transfer principle]] implements Leibniz's law of continuity. The [[standard part function]] implements Fermat's [[adequality]].

[[Vladimir Arnold]] wrote in 1990:
:Nowadays, when teaching analysis, it is not very popular to talk about infinitesimal quantities. Consequently present-day students are not fully in command of this language. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to have command of it.&lt;ref&gt;Arnolʹd, V. I. ''Huygens and Barrow, Newton and Hooke. Pioneers in mathematical analysis and catastrophe theory from evolvents to quasicrystals''. Translated from the Russian by Eric J. F. Primrose. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 1990. p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the infinitesimal==
The notion of infinitely small quantities was discussed by the [[Eleatic School]]. The [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] (c.287 BC–c.212 BC), in ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'', was the first to propose a logically rigorous definition of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;Archimedes, ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems''; see [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Archimedean property]] defines a number ''x'' as infinite if it satisfies the conditions |''x''|&gt;1, |''x''|&gt;1+1, |''x''|&gt;1+1+1, ..., and infinitesimal if ''x''≠0 and a similar set of conditions holds for ''x'' and the reciprocals of the positive integers. A number system is said to be Archimedean if it contains no infinite or infinitesimal members.

The English mathematician [[John Wallis]] introduced the expression 1/∞ in his 1655 book ''Treatise on the Conic Sections''. The symbol, which denotes the reciprocal, or inverse, of&amp;nbsp;[[∞]], is the symbolic representation of the mathematical concept of an infinitesimal. In his ''Treatise on the Conic Sections'' Wallis also discusses the concept of a relationship between the symbolic representation of infinitesimal 1/∞ that he introduced and the concept of infinity for which he introduced the symbol&amp;nbsp;∞. The concept suggests a [[thought experiment]] of adding an infinite number of [[parallelogram]]s of infinitesimal width to form a finite area.  This concept was the predecessor to the modern method of integration used in [[integral calculus]]. The conceptual origins of the concept of the infinitesimal 1/∞ can be traced as far back as the Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]], whose [[Zeno's dichotomy paradox]] was the first mathematical concept to consider the relationship between a finite interval and an interval approaching that of an infinitesimal-sized interval.

Infinitesimals were the subject of political and religious controversies in 17th century Europe, including a ban on infinitesimals issued by clerics in Rome in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World|author=[[Amir Alexander]]|isbn=978-0374176815|year=2014|publisher=Scientific American / Farrar, Straus and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the invention of calculus mathematicians were able to calculate tangent lines using [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s method of [[adequality]] and [[René Descartes]]' [[method of normals]].  There is debate among scholars as to whether the method was infinitesimal or algebraic in nature.  When [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented the [[Infinitesimal calculus|calculus]], they made use of infinitesimals, Newton's ''[[fluxion (mathematics)|fluxions]]'' and Leibniz' ''[[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]''. The use of infinitesimals was attacked as incorrect by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in his work ''[[The Analyst]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''The Analyst; or a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician''&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers continued to use infinitesimals to produce correct results. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the calculus was reformulated by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Dedekind]], and others using the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] and [[set theory]].  
While the followers of Cantor, Dedekind, and Weierstrass sought to rid analysis of infinitesimals, and their philosophical allies like [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] declared that infinitesimals are ''pseudoconcepts'', [[Hermann Cohen]] and his [[Marburg school]] of [[neo-Kantianism]] sought to develop a working logic of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mormann]]; [[Mikhail Katz]]. Infinitesimals as an issue of neo-Kantian philosophy of science. [[International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science|HOPOS]]: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science 3 (2013), no. 2, 236–280. {{doi|10.1086/671348}}. {{JSTOR|10.1086/671348}}. {{arXiv|1304.1027}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mathematical study of systems containing infinitesimals continued through the work of [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], and others, throughout the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, as documented by [[Philip Ehrlich]] (2006).  In the 20th century, it was found that infinitesimals could serve as a basis for calculus and analysis; see [[hyperreal number]].

==First-order properties==
In extending the real numbers to include infinite and infinitesimal quantities, one typically wishes to be as conservative as possible by not changing any of their elementary properties. This guarantees that as many familiar results as possible are still available. Typically ''elementary'' means that there is no [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], but only over elements. This limitation allows statements of the form "for any number x..." For example, the axiom that states "for any number&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" would still apply. The same is true for quantification over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''y'', ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''."  However, statements of the form "for any ''set''&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;of numbers&amp;nbsp;..." may not carry over. Logic with this limitation on quantification is referred to as [[first-order logic]].

The resulting extended number system cannot agree with the reals on all properties that can be expressed by quantification over sets, because the goal is to construct a non-Archimedean system, and the Archimedean principle can be expressed by quantification over sets. One can conservatively extend any theory including reals, including set theory, to include infinitesimals, just by adding a countably infinite list of axioms that assert that a number is smaller than 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and so on. Similarly, the [[Complete metric space|completeness]] property cannot be expected to carry over, because the reals are the unique complete ordered field up to isomorphism.

We can distinguish three levels at which a nonarchimedean number system could have first-order properties compatible with those of the reals:

# An [[ordered field]] obeys all the usual axioms of the real number system that can be stated in first-order logic. For example, the [[commutativity]] axiom ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'' holds.
# A [[real closed field]] has all the first-order properties of the real number system, regardless of whether they are usually taken as axiomatic, for statements involving the basic ordered-field relations +,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤. This is a stronger condition than obeying the ordered-field axioms.  More specifically, one includes additional first-order properties, such as the existence of a root for every odd-degree polynomial. For example, every number must have a [[cube root]].
# The system could have all the first-order properties of the real number system for statements involving ''any'' relations (regardless of whether those relations can be expressed using&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤). For example, there would have to be a [[sine]] function that is well defined for infinite inputs; the same is true for every real function.

Systems in category 1, at the weak end of the spectrum, are relatively easy to construct, but do not allow a full treatment of classical analysis using infinitesimals in the spirit of Newton and Leibniz. For example, the [[transcendental functions]] are defined in terms of infinite limiting processes, and therefore there is typically no way to define them in first-order logic. Increasing the analytic strength of the system by passing to categories&amp;nbsp;2 and&amp;nbsp;3, we find that the flavor of the treatment tends to become less constructive, and it becomes more difficult to say anything concrete about the hierarchical structure of infinities and infinitesimals.

==Number systems that include infinitesimals==

===Formal series===

====Laurent series====
An example from category 1 above is the field of [[Laurent series]] with a finite number of negative-power terms. For example, the Laurent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number&amp;nbsp;1, and the series with only the linear term&amp;nbsp;''x'' is thought of as the simplest infinitesimal, from which the other infinitesimals are constructed. Dictionary ordering is used, which is equivalent to considering higher powers of&amp;nbsp;''x'' as negligible compared to lower powers. [[David O. Tall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |title=Infinitesimals in Modern Mathematics |publisher=Jonhoyle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713115815/http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to this system as the super-reals, not to be confused with the [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin. Since a Taylor series evaluated with a Laurent series as its argument is still a Laurent series, the system can be used to do calculus on transcendental functions if they are analytic. These infinitesimals have different first-order properties than the reals because, for example, the basic infinitesimal&amp;nbsp;''x'' does not have a square root.

====The Levi-Civita field====
The [[Levi-Civita field]] is similar to the Laurent series, but is algebraically closed. For example, the basic infinitesimal x has a square root. This field is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented in floating point.&lt;ref&gt;Khodr Shamseddine, "Analysis on the Levi-Civia Field: A Brief Overview," http://www.uwec.edu/surepam/media/RS-Overview.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transseries====
The field of [[transseries]] is larger than the Levi-Civita field.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Edgar, "Transseries for Beginners," http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~edgar/preprints/trans_begin/&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a transseries is:

:&lt;math&gt;e^\sqrt{\ln\ln x}+\ln\ln x+\sum_{j=0}^\infty e^x x^{-j},&lt;/math&gt;

where for purposes of ordering ''x'' is considered infinite.

===Surreal numbers===
Conway's [[surreal numbers]] fall into category 2. They are a system designed to be as rich as possible in different sizes of numbers, but not necessarily for convenience in doing analysis. Certain transcendental functions can be carried over to the surreals, including logarithms and exponentials, but most, e.g., the sine function, cannot{{fact|date=May 2017}}&lt;!--this seems dubious, see [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/91337/uniformizing-the-surcomplex-unit-circle] In any case, to make the assertion clear, one should be make precise what it is to be expected from such extensions --&gt;. The existence of any particular surreal number, even one that has a direct counterpart in the reals, is not known a priori, and must be proved.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

===Hyperreals===
{{Main article|Hyperreal number}}
The most widespread technique for handling infinitesimals is the hyperreals, developed by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s. They fall into category 3 above, having been designed that way so all of classical analysis can be carried over from the reals. This property of being able to carry over all relations in a natural way is known as the [[transfer principle]], proved by [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  For example, the transcendental function sin has a natural counterpart *sin that takes a hyperreal input and gives a hyperreal output, and similarly the set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a natural counterpart &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which contains both finite and infinite integers. A proposition such as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; carries over to the hyperreals as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in {}^*\mathbb{N}, {}^*\!\!\sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; .

===Superreals===
The [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin is a generalization of the hyperreals. It is different from the super-real system defined by [[David O. Tall|David Tall]].

===Dual numbers===
{{Main article|Dual number}}
In [[linear algebra]], the [[dual number]]s extend the reals by adjoining one infinitesimal, the new element ε with the property ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 (that is, ε is [[nilpotent]]). Every dual number has the form ''z'' = ''a'' + ''b''ε with ''a'' and ''b'' being uniquely determined real numbers.

One application of dual numbers is [[automatic differentiation]]. This application can be generalized to polynomials in n variables, using the [[Exterior algebra]] of an n-dimensional vector space.

===Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===
{{Main article|Smooth infinitesimal analysis}}
[[Synthetic differential geometry]] or [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] have roots in [[category theory]]. This approach departs from the classical logic used in conventional mathematics by denying the general applicability of the [[law of excluded middle]] – i.e., ''not'' (''a'' ≠ ''b'') does not have to mean ''a'' = ''b''. A ''nilsquare'' or ''[[nilpotent]]'' infinitesimal can then be defined. This is a number ''x'' where ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 is true, but ''x'' = 0 need not be true at the same time.  Since the background logic is [[intuitionistic logic]], it is not immediately clear how to classify this system with regard to classes 1, 2, and 3.  Intuitionistic analogues of these classes would have to be developed first.

==Infinitesimal delta functions==
[[Cauchy]] used an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type delta function &lt;math&gt;\delta_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\int F(x)\delta_\alpha(x) = F(0)&lt;/math&gt; in a number of articles in 1827, see Laugwitz (1989).  Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in 1821 (Cours d'Analyse) in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy's and [[Lazare Carnot]]'s terminology.

Modern set-theoretic approaches allow one to define infinitesimals via the [[ultrapower]] construction, where a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in the sense of an equivalence class modulo a relation defined in terms of a suitable [[ultrafilter]]. The article by Yamashita (2007) contains a bibliography on modern [[Dirac delta function]]s in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum provided by the [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]].

==Logical properties==
The method of constructing infinitesimals of the kind used in nonstandard analysis depends on the [[Model theory|model]] and which collection of [[axiom]]s are used. We consider here systems where infinitesimals can be shown to exist.

In 1936 [[Anatoly Maltsev|Maltsev]] proved the [[compactness theorem]]. This theorem is fundamental for the existence of infinitesimals as it proves that it is possible to formalise them. A consequence of this theorem is that if there is a number system in which it is true that for any positive integer ''n'' there is a positive number ''x'' such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n'', then there exists an extension of that number system in which it is true that there exists a positive number ''x'' such that for any positive integer ''n'' we have 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n''. The possibility to switch  "for any" and "there exists" is crucial. The first statement is true in the real numbers as given in [[ZFC]] [[set theory]] : for any positive integer ''n'' it is possible to find a real number between 1/''n'' and zero, but this real number depends on ''n''. Here, one chooses ''n'' first, then one finds the corresponding ''x''. In the second expression, the statement says that there is an  ''x'' (at least one), chosen first, which is between 0 and 1/''n'' for any ''n''. In this case ''x'' is infinitesimal. This is not true in the real numbers ('''R''') given by ZFC. Nonetheless, the theorem proves that there is a model (a number system) in which this is true. The question is: what is this model? What are its properties? Is there only one such model?

There are in fact many ways to construct such a [[dimension|one-dimensional]] [[linear order|linearly ordered]] set of numbers, but fundamentally, there are two different approaches:

: 1) Extend the number system so that it contains more numbers than the real numbers.

: 2) Extend the axioms (or extend the language) so that the distinction between the infinitesimals and non-infinitesimals can be made in the real numbers themselves.

In 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] provided an answer following the first approach. The extended set is called the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] and contains numbers less in absolute value than any positive real number. The method may be considered relatively complex but it does prove that infinitesimals exist in the universe of ZFC set theory. The real numbers are called standard numbers and the new non-real hyperreals are called [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard]].

In 1977 [[Edward Nelson]] provided an answer following the second approach. The extended axioms are IST, which stands either for [[Internal set theory]] or for the initials of the three extra axioms: Idealization, Standardization, Transfer. In this system we consider that the language is extended in such a way that we can express facts about infinitesimals. The real numbers are either standard or nonstandard. An infinitesimal is a nonstandard real number that is less, in absolute value, than any positive standard real number.

In 2006 Karel Hrbacek developed an extension of Nelson's approach in which the real numbers are stratified in (infinitely) many levels; i.e., in the coarsest level there are no infinitesimals nor unlimited numbers. Infinitesimals are in a finer level and there are also infinitesimals with respect to this new level and so on.

==Infinitesimals in teaching==
Calculus textbooks based on infinitesimals include the classic ''[[Calculus Made Easy]]'' by [[Silvanus P. Thompson]] (bearing the motto "What one fool can do another can"&lt;ref&gt;Available online at 
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33283&lt;/ref&gt;) and the German text ''Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie'' by R Neuendorff.&lt;ref&gt;R Neuendorff (1912) ''Lehrbuch der Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie'', Verlag Julius Springer, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering works based on [[Abraham Robinson]]'s infinitesimals include texts by [[Stroyan]] (dating from 1972) and [[Howard Jerome Keisler]] ([[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]). Students easily relate to the intuitive notion of an infinitesimal difference 1-"[[0.999...]]", where  "0.999..." differs from its standard meaning as the real number 1, and is reinterpreted as an infinite terminating extended decimal that is strictly less than 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ely |first=Robert |year=2010 |title=Nonstandard student conceptions about infinitesimals |journal=[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=117–146 |jstor=20720128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no1/TMME_vol7no1_2010_article1_pp.3_30.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207075126/http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no1/TMME_vol7no1_2010_article1_pp.3_30.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another elementary calculus text that uses the theory of infinitesimals as developed by Robinson is ''Infinitesimal Calculus'' by Henle and Kleinberg, originally published in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal Calculus|last=Henle|first=James|last2=Kleinberg|first2=Eugene|publisher=The MIT Press, rereleased by Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors introduce the language of first order logic, and demonstrate the construction of a first order model of the hyperreal numbers.  The text provides an introduction to the basics of integral and differential calculus in one dimension, including sequences and series of functions.  In an Appendix, they also treat the extension of their model to the ''hyperhyper''reals, and demonstrate some applications for the extended model.

==Functions tending to zero==
In a related but somewhat different sense, which evolved from the original definition of "infinitesimal" as an infinitely small quantity, the term has also been used to refer to a function tending to zero.  More precisely, Loomis and Sternberg's ''Advanced Calculus'' defines the function class of infinitesimals, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}&lt;/math&gt;, as a subset of functions &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,

That the inclusions are proper is demonstrated by the real-valued functions of a real variable &lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto |x|^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g:x\mapsto x &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h:x\mapsto x^2 &lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f,g,h\in\mathfrak{I}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\  g,h\in\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\

If such a map exists, it is unique; this map is called the ''differential'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;dF_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;This notation is not to be confused with the many other distinct usages of ''d'' in calculus that are all loosely related to the classical notion of the differential as "taking an infinitesimally small piece of something": ''(1)'' in the expression&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\, d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; indicates Riemann-Stieltjes integration with respect to the integrator function &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; ''(2)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int f\, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\mu&lt;/math&gt; symbolizes Lebesgue integration with respect to a measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;; ''(3)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} f\; dV&lt;/math&gt;, ''dV'' indicates integration with respect to volume; ''(4)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_n}&lt;/math&gt;, the letter ''d'' represents the exterior derivative operator, and so on....&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the traditional notation for the classical (though logically flawed) notion of a differential as an infinitely small "piece" of ''F''.  This definition represents a generalization of the usual definition of differentiability for vector-valued functions of (open subsets of) Euclidean spaces.

==Array of random variables==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]] and let &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. An array &lt;math&gt;\{X_{n,k}:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\mid 1\le k\le k_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[random variable]]s is called infinitesimal if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we have:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal |last=Barczyk|first=Adam |last2=Janssen|first2=Arnold |last3=Pauly|first3=Markus |year=2011 |title=The Asymptotics of L-statistics for non-i.i.d. variables with heavy tails|journal=[[Probability and mathematical statistics]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=285–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{1\le k\le k_{n}}\mathbb{P}\{\omega\in\Omega\mid \vert X_{n,k}(\omega)\vert\geq\epsilon\}\to 0\text{ as } n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; 
The notion of infinitesimal array is essential in some central limit theorems and it is easily seen by monotonicity of the expectation operator that any array satisfying [[Lindeberg's condition]] is infinitesimal, thus playing an important role in [[Central limit theorem#Lindeberg CLT|Lindeberg's Central Limit Theorem]] (a generalization of the [[central limit theorem]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3410">'''Informal mathematics''', also called '''naïve mathematics''', has historically been the predominant form of [[mathematics]] at most times and in most cultures, and is the subject of modern [[ethnomathematics|ethno-cultural studies of mathematics]]. The philosopher [[Imre Lakatos]] in his ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' aimed to sharpen the formulation of informal mathematics, by reconstructing its role in nineteenth century mathematical debates and concept formation, opposing the predominant assumptions of [[mathematical formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, ''Proofs and Refutations'' (1976), especially the Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informality may not discern between statements given by ''[[inductive reasoning]]'' (as in [[approximation]]s which are deemed "correct" merely because they are useful), and statements derived by ''[[deductive reasoning]]''.

==Terminology==

''Informal mathematics'' means any informal mathematical practices, as used in everyday life, or by aboriginal or ancient peoples, without historical or geographical limitation. Modern mathematics, exceptionally from that point of view, emphasizes formal and strict [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of all statements from given [[axiom]]s. This can usefully be called therefore ''formal mathematics''. Informal practices are usually understood intuitively and justified with examples—there are no axioms. This is of direct interest in [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]]: it casts light on the perceptions and agreements of other cultures.  It is also of interest in [[developmental psychology]] as it reflects a naïve understanding of the relationships between numbers and things. Another term used for informal mathematics is '''folk mathematics''', which is ambiguous; the [[mathematical folklore]] article is dedicated to the usage of that term among professional mathematicians.

The field of [[naïve physics]] is concerned with similar understandings of physics. People use mathematics and physics in everyday life, without really understanding (or caring) how mathematical and physical ideas were historically derived and justified.

==History==
There has long been a standard account of the development of [[geometry]] in [[ancient Egypt]], followed by [[Greek mathematics]] and the emergence of deductive logic. The modern sense of the term ''mathematics'', as meaning only those systems justified with reference to axioms, is however an [[anachronism]] if read back into history. Several ancient societies built impressive mathematical systems and carried out complex calculations based on proofless [[heuristic]]s and practical approaches. Mathematical facts were accepted on a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] basis. [[Empirical method]]s, as in science, provided the justification for a given technique. Commerce, [[engineering]], [[calendar]] creation and the prediction of [[eclipse]]s and [[stellar progression]] were practiced by ancient cultures on at least three continents. N.C. Ghosh included Informal Mathematics in the list of Folk Mathematics.

In [[algebraic geometry]], '''Jouanolou's trick''' is a theorem that asserts, for an [[algebraic variety]] ''X'', the existence of a [[surjection]] with affine [[fiber (mathematics)|fibers]] from an [[affine variety]] ''W'' to ''X''.  The variety ''W'' is therefore [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy-equivalent]] to ''X'', but it has the technically advantageous property of being affine.  Jouanolou's original statement of the theorem required that ''X'' be quasi-projective over an affine scheme, but this has since been considerably weakened.

== Jouanolou's construction ==

Jouanolou's original statement was:

:If ''X'' is a scheme quasi-projective over an affine scheme, then there exists a vector bundle ''E'' over ''X'' and an affine ''E''-torsor ''W''.

By the definition of a torsor, ''W'' comes with a surjective map to ''X'' and is Zariski-locally on ''X'' an affine space bundle.

Jouanolou's proof used an explicit construction.  Let ''S'' be an affine scheme and &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbf{P}^r_S&lt;/math&gt;.  Interpret the affine space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{(r+1)^2}_S&lt;/math&gt; as the space of (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) matrices over ''S''.  Within this affine space, there is a subvariety ''W'' consisting of idempotent matrices of rank one.  The image of such a matrix is therefore a point in ''X'', and the map &lt;math&gt;W \to X&lt;/math&gt; that sends a matrix to the point corresponding to its image is the map claimed in the statement of the theorem.  To show that this map has the desired properties, Jouanolou notes that there is a short exact sequence of vector bundles:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \mathcal{O}_X(-1) \to \mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus r + 1} \to \mathcal{F} \to 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where the first map is defined by multiplication by a basis of sections of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(1)&lt;/math&gt; and the second map is the cokernel.  Jouanolou then asserts that ''W'' is a torsor for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{O}_X(-1))&lt;/math&gt;.

Jouanolou deduces the theorem in general by reducing to the above case.  If ''X'' is projective over an affine scheme ''S'', then it admits a closed immersion into some projective space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^r_S&lt;/math&gt;.  Pulling back the variety ''W'' constructed above for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^r_S&lt;/math&gt; along this immersion yields the desired variety ''W'' for ''X''.  Finally, if ''X'' is quasi-projective, then it may be realized as an open subscheme of a projective ''S''-scheme.  Blow up the complement of ''X'' to get &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;i \colon X \to \bar X&lt;/math&gt; denote the inclusion morphism.  The complement of ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt; is a Cartier divisor, and therefore ''i'' is an affine morphism.  Now perform the previous construction for &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt; and pull back along ''i''.

== Thomason's construction ==

Robert Thomason observed that, by making a less explicit construction, it was possible to obtain the same conclusion under significantly weaker hypotheses.  Thomason's construction first appeared in a paper of Weibel.  Thomason's theorem asserts:

:Let ''X'' be a quasicompact and quasiseparated scheme with an ample family of line bundles.  Then an affine vector bundle torsor over ''X'' exists.

Having an ample family of line bundles was first defined in SGA 6 Exposé II Définition 2.2.4.  Any quasi-projective scheme over an affine scheme has an ample family of line bundles, as does any separated locally factorial Noetherian scheme.

Thomason's proof abstracts the key features of Jouanolou's.  By hypothesis, ''X'' admits a set of line bundles ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; and sections ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; whose non-vanishing loci are affine and cover ''X''.  Define ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the non-vanishing locus of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; to be the direct sum of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The sections define a morphism of vector bundles &lt;math&gt;s = (s_0, \ldots, s_N) \colon \mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;.  Define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; to be the cokernel of ''s''.  On ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s'' is a split monomorphism since it is inverted by the inverse of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Therefore &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector bundle over ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and because these open sets cover ''X'', &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector bundle.

Define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(\mathcal{E}) = \operatorname{Proj} \operatorname{Sym}^* \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; and similarly for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;.  Let ''W'' be the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(\mathcal{E})&lt;/math&gt;.  There is an equivalent description of ''W'' as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(\operatorname{Sym}^* \mathcal{E} / (s - 1))&lt;/math&gt;, and from this description, it is easy to check that it is a torsor for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore the projection &lt;math&gt;\pi \colon W \to X&lt;/math&gt; is affine.  To see that ''W'' is itself affine, apply a criterion of Serre (EGA II 5.2.1(b), EGA IV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 1.7.17).  Each ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; determines a global section ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''W''.  The non-vanishing locus ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(X_i)&lt;/math&gt;, which is affine, and hence ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is affine.  The sum of the sections ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is 1, so the ideal they generate is the ring of global sections.  Serre's criterion now implies that ''W'' is affine.

Nilakantha somayaji was an important [[astronomer]]-[[mathematician]] of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] and was the author of the much celebrated astronomical work titled [[Tantrasamgraha]]. This book stresses the necessity and importance of astronomical observations to obtain correct parameters for computations and to develop more and more accurate theories. It even discounts the role of revealed wisdom and divine intuitions in studying astronomical phenomena. Jyotirmimamsa is sometimes cited as proof to establish that modern methodologies of scientific investigations are not unknown to ancient and medieval Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roddam Narasimha|title=Different types of history|editor=Bharati Ray|publisher=Centre for Studies in Civilisation|location=Delhi|date=2009|series=project of History of Science, Philosophy, and Culture in Indian Civilisation|volume=XIV Part 4|pages=96–97|chapter=^ .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11834">'''[[Abstract algebra]]''' is the subject area of [[mathematics]] that studies [[algebraic structure]]s, such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[vector space]]s, and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. The phrase '''abstract algebra''' was coined at the turn of the 20th century to distinguish this area from what was normally referred to as '''algebra''', the study of the rules for manipulating formulae and algebraic expressions involving unknowns and [[real numbers|real]] or [[complex number]]s, often now called ''[[elementary algebra]]''. The distinction is rarely made in more recent writings.

==Basic language==
[[Algebraic structure]]s are defined primarily as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] with ''operations''. 
*[[Algebraic structure]]
**[[Subobject]]s: [[subgroup]], [[subring]], [[subalgebra]], [[submodule]] etc.
*[[Binary operation]]
**[[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]] of an operation
**[[Associative property]]
**[[Distributive property]]
**[[Commutative property]]
*[[Unary operator]]
**[[Additive inverse]], [[multiplicative inverse]], [[inverse element]]
***[[Identity element]]
***[[Cancellation property]]
*[[Finitary operation]]
**[[Arity]]

Structure preserving maps called ''homomorphisms'' are vital in the study of algebraic objects.

**[[kernel (algebra)|Kernel]]s and [[cokernel]]s
**[[image (mathematics)|Image]] and [[coimage]]
**[[Epimorphism]]s and [[monomorphism]]s

|Click "show" for description.|A [[truncated trihexagonal tiling|periodic tiling]] with a fundamental unit (triangle) and a primitive cell (hexagon) highlighted. A tiling of the entire plane can be generated by fitting copies of these triangular patches together. In order to do this, the basic triangle needs to be rotated 180 degrees in order to fit it edge-to-edge to a neighboring triangle. Thus a [[triangular tiling]] of fundamental units will be generated that is [[#MLD|mutually locally derivable]] from the tiling by the colored tiles. The other figure drawn onto the tiling, the white hexagon, represents a primitive cell of the tiling. Copies of the corresponding patch of coloured tiles can be [[Translation (geometry)|translated]] to form an infinite tiling of the plane. It is not necessary to rotate this patch in order to achieve this.}}|alt=]]

In [[geometry]], a [[Tessellation|tiling]] is a partition of the plane (or any other geometric setting) into closed sets (called ''tiles''), without gaps or overlaps (other than the boundaries of the tiles).&lt;ref name="Tilings by Regular Polygons"&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.2307/2689529|author1=Grünbaum, Branko |author2=Shephard, Geoffrey C. |title=Tilings by Regular Polygons|journal=Math. Mag.|volume=50|issue=5|year=1977|pages=227–247|jstor=2689529}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tiling is considered periodic if there exist translations in two independent directions which map the tiling onto itself. Such a tiling is composed of a single [[Fundamental domain|fundamental unit]] or [[primitive cell]] which repeats endlessly and regularly in two independent directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edwards, Steve |url=http://ksuweb.kennesaw.edu/~sedwar77/tile/defs/fundamental.htm |title=Fundamental Regions and Primitive cells |website=Tiling Plane &amp; Fancy |publisher=Kennesaw State University |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5smoLyN1Y?url=http://www.spsu.edu/math/tile/defs/fundamental.htm |archive-date=2010-09-16 |access-date=2017-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a tiling is shown in the adjacent diagram (see the image description for more information). A tiling that cannot be constructed from a single primitive cell is called nonperiodic. If a given set of tiles allows only nonperiodic tilings, then this set of tiles is called [[aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Wagon, Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbVrWLNiub4C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=nonperiodic+tiling#v=onepage&amp;q=nonperiodic%20tiling&amp;f=false|title=Mathematica in Action|pages=268|edition=3rd|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=2010|isbn=9780387754772}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tilings obtained from an aperiodic set of tiles are often called [[aperiodic tiling]]s, though strictly speaking it is the tiles themselves that are aperiodic. (The tiling itself is said to be "nonperiodic".)

The first table explains the abbreviations used in the second table. The second table contains all known aperiodic sets of tiles and gives some additional basic information about each set. This list of tiles is still incomplete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3857">This partial '''list of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s''' contains definitions of graphs and graph families which are known by particular names, but do not have a Wikipedia article of their own.

For collected definitions of [[graph theory]] terms that do not refer to individual graph types, such as ''vertex'' and ''path'', see [[Glossary of graph theory]]. For links to existing articles about particular kinds of graphs, see [[:Category:Graphs|Category:Graphs]].

==Gear==
[[File:Gear graph.svg|thumb|''G''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt;]]
A '''gear graph''', denoted ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a graph obtained by inserting an extra vertex between each pair of adjacent vertices on the perimeter of a [[wheel graph]] ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has 2''n''+1 vertices and 3''n'' edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=GearGraph|title=Gear graph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gear graphs are examples of [[squaregraph]]s, and play a key role in the [[forbidden graph characterization]] of squaregraphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorics and geometry of finite and infinite squaregraphs|first1=H.-J.|last1=Bandelt|first2=V.|last2=Chepoi|first3=D.|last3=Eppstein|author3-link=David Eppstein|arxiv=0905.4537|journal=[[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics]]|volume=24|issue=4|pages=1399–1440|year=2010|doi=10.1137/090760301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gear graphs are also known as '''cogwheels''' and '''bipartite wheels'''.

==Grid==
A '''[[grid graph]]''' is a [[unit distance graph]] corresponding to the [[square lattice]], so that it is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the graph having a vertex corresponding to every pair of integers (''a'', ''b''), and an edge connecting (''a'', ''b'') to (''a''+1, ''b'') and (''a'', ''b''+1). The finite grid graph ''G&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an ''m''×''n'' rectangular graph isomorphic to the one obtained by restricting the ordered pairs to the range 0 ≤ ''a'' &lt; ''m'', 0 ≤ ''b'' &lt; ''n''. Grid graphs can be obtained as the [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product]] of two [[path (graph theory)|path]]s: ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; × ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Every grid graph is a [[median graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=GridGraph|title=Grid graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helm==
A '''helm graph''', denoted '''''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is a graph obtained by attaching a single edge and node to each node of the outer circuit of a [[wheel graph]] '''''W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=HelmGraph|title=Helm graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="combinatorics.org"&gt;http://www.combinatorics.org/Surveys/ds6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobster==
A '''lobster''' graph is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] in which all the vertices are within distance&amp;nbsp;2 of a central [[path (graph theory)|path]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=Pine.LNX.4.44.0303310019440.1408-100000@eva117.cs.ualberta.ca |title=Google Discussiegroepen |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=Lobster|title=Lobster}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compare [[Caterpillar tree|''caterpillar'']].

==Web==
[[Image:Cube graph.png|thumb|100px|The web graph ''W''&lt;sub&gt;4,2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[cube]].]]
The '''web''' graph ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is a graph consisting of ''r'' concentric copies of the [[cycle graph]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, with corresponding vertices connected by "spokes". Thus ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sub&gt; is the same graph as ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''W''&lt;sub&gt;n,2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[prism (geometry)|prism]].

A web graph has also been defined as a prism graph '''''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1, 3&lt;/sub&gt;''', with the edges of the outer cycle removed.&lt;ref name="combinatorics.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=WebGraph|title=Web graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8025">In [[mathematics]], an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] or [[transformation (mathematics)|transform]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from one [[function space|space of functions]] to another. Operators occur commonly in [[engineering]], [[physics]] and mathematics. Many are [[integral operator]]s and [[differential operator]]s.

In the following ''L'' is an operator

:&lt;math&gt;L:\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;

which takes a function &lt;math&gt;y\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; to another function &lt;math&gt;L[y]\in\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; are some unspecified [[function space]]s, such as [[Hardy space]], [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; space]], [[Sobolev space]], or, more vaguely, the space of [[holomorphic function]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24165">{{Lie groups |Simple}}

In [[mathematics]], the [[simple Lie group]]s were first classified by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and later perfected by [[Élie Cartan]]. This classification is often referred to as Killing-Cartan classification. 

The list of simple Lie groups can be used to read off the list of [[simple Lie algebra]]s and [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s.  See also the [[table of Lie groups]] for a smaller list of groups that commonly occur in [[theoretical physics]], and the [[Bianchi classification]] for groups of dimension at most 3. 

== Simple Lie groups ==

Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted definition of a [[simple Lie group]]. In particular, it is not always defined as a Lie group that is [[simple group|simple]] as an abstract group. Authors differ on whether a simple Lie group has to be connected, or on whether it is allowed to have a non-trivial center, or on whether '''R''' is a simple Lie group. 

The most common definition is that a Lie group is simple if it is connected, non-abelian, and every closed ''connected'' normal subgroup is either the identity or the whole group. In particular, simple groups are allowed to have a non-trivial center, but '''R''' is not simple. 

In this article the connected simple Lie groups with trivial center are listed.  Once these are known, the ones with non-trivial center are easy to list as follows. Any simple Lie group with trivial center has a [[covering space#universal covers|universal cover]], whose center is the fundamental group of the simple Lie group. The corresponding simple Lie groups with non-trivial center can be obtained as quotients of this universal cover by a subgroup of the center.

== Simple Lie algebras ==

The Lie algebra of a simple Lie group is a simple Lie algebra. This is a one-to-one correspondence between connected simple Lie groups with [[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]] center and simple Lie algebras of dimension greater than 1. (Authors differ on whether the one-dimensional Lie algebra should be counted as simple.)

Over the complex numbers the semisimple Lie algebras are classified by their [[Dynkin diagram]]s, of types "ABCDEFG". If ''L'' is a real simple Lie algebra, its complexification is a simple complex Lie algebra, unless ''L'' is already 
the complexification of a Lie algebra, in which case the complexification of ''L'' is a product of two copies of ''L''. This reduces the problem of classifying the real simple Lie algebras to that of finding all the [[real form]]s of each complex simple Lie algebra (i.e., real Lie algebras whose complexification is the given complex Lie algebra). There are always at least 2 such forms: a split form and a compact form, and there are usually a few others. The different real forms correspond to the classes of automorphisms of order at most 2 of the complex Lie algebra.

== Symmetric spaces ==

Symmetric spaces are classified as follows. 

First, the universal cover of a symmetric space is still symmetric, so we can reduce to the case of simply connected symmetric spaces. (For example, the universal cover of a real projective plane is a sphere.)

Second, the product of symmetric spaces is symmetric, so we may as well just classify the irreducible simply connected ones (where irreducible means they cannot be written as a product of smaller symmetric spaces). 

The irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces are the real line, and exactly two symmetric spaces corresponding to  each ''non-compact'' simple Lie group ''G'',
one compact and one non-compact. The non-compact one is a cover of the quotient of ''G'' by a maximal compact subgroup ''H'', and the compact one is a cover of the quotient of
the compact form of ''G'' by the same subgroup ''H''. This duality between compact and non-compact symmetric spaces is a generalization of the well known duality between spherical and hyperbolic geometry.

== Hermitian symmetric spaces ==

A symmetric space with a compatible complex structure is called Hermitian.  The compact simply connected irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces fall into 4 infinite families with 2 exceptional ones left over, and each has a non-compact dual. In addition the complex plane is also a Hermitian symmetric space; this gives the complete list of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces.

The four families are the types A&amp;nbsp;III, B&amp;nbsp;I and D&amp;nbsp;I for {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2}}, D&amp;nbsp;III, and C&amp;nbsp;I, and the two exceptional ones are types E&amp;nbsp;III and E&amp;nbsp;VII of complex dimensions 16 and 27.

== Notation ==

&lt;math&gt; \mathbb {R, C, H, O} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; stand for the real numbers, complex numbers, [[quaternions]], and [[octonion]]s.

In the symbols such as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; for the exceptional groups, the exponent &amp;minus;26 is the signature of an invariant symmetric bilinear form that is negative definite on the maximal compact subgroup. It is equal to the dimension of the group minus twice the dimension of a maximal compact subgroup.

The fundamental group listed in the table below is the fundamental group of the simple group with trivial center. 
Other simple groups with the same Lie algebra correspond to subgroups of this fundamental group (modulo the action of the outer automorphism group).

==Notes==
:{{Note|Note†|†}} The group '''R''' is not simple as an abstract group, and according to most (but not all) definitions this is not a simple Lie group. Most authors do not count its Lie algebra as a simple Lie algebra. It is listed here so that the list of irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces is complete. Note that '''R''' is the only such non-compact symmetric space without a compact dual (although it has a compact quotient ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

One of the main tools for determining the existence of (or non-existence of) chaos in a perturbed [[Hamiltonian system]] is Melnikov theory. In this theory, the distance between the stable and unstable manifolds of the perturbed system is calculated up to the first-order term. Consider a smooth dynamical system &lt;math&gt;\ddot x = f(x) + \epsilon g(t)&lt;/math&gt;,  with &lt;math&gt; \epsilon \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; periodic with period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt; the system has a [[hyperbolic fixed point]] x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a [[homoclinic orbit]] &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to this [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]. Then for sufficiently small &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a ''T''-periodic hyperbolic solution. The stable and unstable manifolds of this periodic solution intersect transversally. The distance between these manifolds measured along a direction that is perpendicular to the unperturbed  homoclinc orbit &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Melnikov distance'''. If &lt;math&gt;d(t)&lt;/math&gt;
denotes this distance, then &lt;math&gt;d(t) = \epsilon (M(t) + O(\epsilon))&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;M(t)&lt;/math&gt; is called the Melnikov function.

Melnikov’s distance can be used to predict chaotic vibrations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alemansour|first1=Hamed|last2=Miandoab|first2=Ehsan Maani|last3=Pishkenari|first3=Hossein Nejat|title=Effect of size on the chaotic behavior of nano resonators|journal=Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation|date=March 2017|volume=44|pages=495–505|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570416303197}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this method, critical amplitude is found by setting the distance between homoclinic orbits and stable manifolds equal to zero. The Melnikov’s method provides necessary but not sufficient condition for chaos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3223">The '''Millennium Mathematics Project''' ('''MMP''') was set up within the [[University of Cambridge]] in [[England]] as a joint project between the Faculties of Mathematics and Education in 1999. The MMP aims to support maths education for pupils of all abilities from ages 5 to 19 and promote the development of mathematical skills and understanding, particularly through enrichment and extension activities beyond the school curriculum, and to enhance the mathematical understanding of the general public. The project is currently{{when|date=December 2013}} directed by [[John D. Barrow|John Barrow]].

The MMP includes a range of complementary programmes:

*The NRICH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrich.maths.org |title=NRICH : Homepage |publisher=Nrich.maths.org |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; website publishes free mathematics education enrichment material for ages 5 to 19. NRICH material focuses on problem-solving, building core mathematical reasoning and strategic thinking skills. In the academic year 2004/5 the website attracted over 1.7 million site visits (more than 49 million hits).
*''[[Plus Magazine]]'' is a free online maths magazine for age 15+ and the general public. In 2004/5, Plus attracted over 1.3 million website visits (more than 31 million hits). The website won the [[Webby Awards|Webby]] award in 2001 for the best Science site on the Internet.
*The Motivate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motivate.maths.org |title=Motivate... |publisher=motivate.maths.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; video-conferencing project links university mathematicians and scientists to primary and secondary schools in areas of the UK from Jersey and Belfast to Glasgow and inner-city London, with international links to Pakistan, South Africa, India and Singapore.

The project has also developed a Hands On Maths Roadshow presenting creative methods of exploring mathematics, and in 2004 took on the running of Simon Singh's Enigma schools workshops, exploring maths through cryptography and codebreaking. Both are taken to primary and secondary schools and public venues such as shopping centres across the UK and Ireland. [[James Grime]] is the Enigma Project Officer and gives talks in schools and to the general public about the history and mathematics of code breaking - including the demonstration of a genuine World War II Enigma Machine.

In November 2005, the MMP won the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for Higher and Further Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/maths-project-wins-queen%E2%80%99s-anniversary-prize Maths project wins Queen’s Anniversary prize], University of Cambridge News, 18 Nov 2005, retrieved 2015-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''Nash blowing-up''' is a process in which, roughly speaking, each [[Singular point of an algebraic variety|singular point]] is replaced by all the limiting positions of the [[tangent spaces]] at the non-singular points. Strictly speaking, if ''X'' is an [[algebraic variety]] of pure [[codimension]] ''r'' [[embedding|embedded]] in a [[smooth variety]] of dimension ''n'', &lt;math&gt;\text{Sing}(X)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of its singular points and &lt;math&gt;X_\text{reg}:=X\setminus \text{Sing}(X)&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to define a map &lt;math&gt;\tau:X_\text{reg}\rightarrow X\times G_r^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G_{r}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Grassmannian]] of ''r''-planes in ''n''-space, by &lt;math&gt;\tau(a):=(a,T_{X,a})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T_{X,a}&lt;/math&gt; is the tangent space of ''X'' at ''a''. Now, the closure of the image of this map together with the projection to ''X'' is called the Nash blowing-up of ''X''.

Although (to emphasize its geometric interpretation) an embedding was used to define the Nash embedding it is possible to prove that it doesn't depend on it. 

==Properties==

* The Nash blowing-up is locally a [[blowing up|monoidal transformation]].
* If ''X'' is a [[complete intersection]] defined by the vanishing of &lt;math&gt;f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_{n-r}&lt;/math&gt; then the Nash blowing-up is the blowing-up with center given by the ideal generated by the (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'')-minors of the matrix with entries &lt;math&gt;\partial f_i/\partial x_j&lt;/math&gt;.
* For a variety over a field of characteristic zero, the Nash blowing-up is an [[isomorphism]] if and only if ''X'' is non-singular. 
* For an algebraic curve over an [[algebraically closed field]] of characteristic zero the application of Nash blowings-up leads to [[resolution of singularities|desingularization]] after a finite number of steps. 
* In characteristic ''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, for the curve &lt;math&gt;y^2-x^q=0&lt;/math&gt; the Nash blowing-up is the monoidal transformation with center given by the ideal &lt;math&gt;(x^{q})&lt;/math&gt;, for ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, or &lt;math&gt;(y^2)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;q&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. Since the center is a hypersurface the blowing-up is an isomorphism. Then the two previous points are not true in positive characteristic.

{{distinguish|text=the symbol denoting a [[mathematical operation]] or [[mathematical symbol]]}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''operator''' is generally a [[Map_(mathematics)|mapping]] that acts on elements of a [[space (mathematics)|space]] to produce other elements of the same space. The most common operators are [[linear map]]s, which act on [[vector space]]s. However, when using "linear operator" instead of "linear map", mathematicians often mean actions on vector spaces of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, which also preserve other properties, such as [[continuous function|continuity]]. For example, [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] and [[indefinite integration]] are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called [[differential operator]]s, [[integral operator]]s or [[integro-differential operator]]s.

'''Operator''' is also used for denoting the symbol of a [[mathematical operation]]. This is related with the meaning of "operator" in [[computer programming]], see [[operator (computer programming)]].

== Linear operators ==
{{Main|Linear operator}}

The most common kind of operator encountered are ''linear operators''. Let ''U'' and ''V'' be vector spaces over a field ''K''. A [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] ''A'': ''U'' → ''V'' is linear if
:&lt;math&gt;A(\alpha \mathbf{x} + \beta \mathbf{y}) = \alpha A \mathbf{x} + \beta A \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;
for all '''x''', '''y''' in ''U'' and for all ''α, β'' in ''K''.  
This means that a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are [[morphism]]s between vector spaces.

In finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in the following way. Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a field, and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be finite-dimensional vector spaces over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Let us select a basis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{u}_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_m&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Then let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = x^i \mathbf{u}_i&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary vector in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (assuming [[Einstein convention]]), and &lt;math&gt;A: U \to V&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator. Then
: &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x} = x^i A\mathbf{u}_i = x^i (A\mathbf{u}_i)^j \mathbf{v}_j &lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;a_i^j := (A\mathbf{u}_i)^j \in K&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of the operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in fixed bases. &lt;math&gt;a_i^j&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the choice of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;a_i^j x^i = y^j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus in fixed bases n-by-m matrices are in bijective correspondence to linear operators from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

The important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of [[Matrix rank|rank]], [[determinant]], [[inverse operator]], and [[eigenspace]].

Linear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank and determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (and operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as [[functional analysis]] (so called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).

The space of [[sequence]]s of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, and these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as [[sequence space]]s. Operators on these spaces are known as [[sequence transformation]]s.

Bounded linear operators over [[Banach space]] form a [[Banach algebra]] in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectra]] that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.

== Bounded operators==
{{Main|bounded operator|operator norm|Banach algebra}}

Let ''U'' and ''V'' be two vector spaces over the same [[ordered field]] (for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;), and they are equipped with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s. Then a linear operator from ''U'' to ''V'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists ''C &gt; 0'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;||A\mathbf{x}||_V \leq C||\mathbf{x}||_U&lt;/math&gt;
for all '''x''' in ''U''.

Bounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of ''U'' and ''V'':
:&lt;math&gt;||A|| = \inf\{C: ||A\mathbf{x}||_V \leq C||\mathbf{x}||_U\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In case of operators from ''U'' to itself it can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;||AB|| \leq ||A||\cdot||B||&lt;/math&gt;.

Any unital [[normed algebra]] with this property is called a [[Banach algebra]]. It is possible to generalize [[spectral theory]] to such algebras. [[C*-algebra]]s, which are [[Banach algebras]] with some additional structure, play an important role in [[quantum mechanics]].

== Examples ==
=== Geometry ===
{{Main|general linear group|isometry}}

In [[geometry]], additional structures on [[vector space]]s are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves bijectively are very useful in these studies, they naturally form [[group (mathematics)|group]]s by composition.

For example, bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the [[invertible]] [[linear operator]]s. They form the [[general linear group]] under composition. They ''do not'' form a vector space under the addition of operators, e.g. both ''id'' and ''-id'' are invertible (bijective), but their sum, 0, is not.

Operators preserving the Euclidean metric on such a space form the [[isometry group]], and those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the [[orthogonal group]]. Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the [[special orthogonal group]], or the group of rotations.

=== Probability theory ===
{{Main|Probability theory}}

Operators are also involved in probability theory, such as [[expected value|expectation]], [[variance]],  and [[covariance]].{{clarify|reason = Why these are operators?|date=February 2018}}
&lt;!-- if you know it and you know it please expand... --&gt;

=== Calculus ===
{{Main|differential operator|integral operator}}
From the point of view of [[functional analysis]], [[calculus]] is the study of two linear operators: the [[differential operator]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Volterra operator|indefinite integral operator]] &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Fourier series and Fourier transform ====

{{Main|Fourier series|Fourier transform}}

The Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics and signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on one (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively [[invertible]]. No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of [[periodic function]]s, this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of [[sine wave]]s and cosine waves:
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = {a_0 \over 2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{ a_n \cos ( \omega n t ) + b_n \sin ( \omega n t ) } &lt;/math&gt;
The tuple ''(a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...)'' is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space [[Sequence space|ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], and thus Fourier series is a linear operator.

When dealing with general function '''R''' → '''C''', the transform takes on an [[integral]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = {1 \over \sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty}{g( \omega )e^{ i \omega t } \,d\omega }. &lt;/math&gt;

==== Laplace transform ====

{{Main|Laplace transform}}
The ''Laplace transform'' is another integral operator and is involved in simplifying the process of solving differential equations.

Given ''f'' = ''f''(''s''), it is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) =\int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Fundamental operators on scalar and vector fields ===
{{Main|vector calculus|vector field|scalar field|gradient|divergence|curl (mathematics)|l6=curl}}

Three operators are key to [[vector calculus]]:
* Grad ([[gradient]]), (with operator symbol [[Del|&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;]]) assigns a vector at every point in a scalar field that points in the direction of greatest rate of change of that field and whose norm measures the absolute value of that greatest rate of change.
* Div ([[divergence]]), (with operator symbol [[Del#Divergence|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot&lt;/math&gt;]]) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's divergence from or convergence towards a given point.
* [[Curl (mathematics)|Curl]], (with operator symbol [[Del#Curl|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times&lt;/math&gt;]]) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's curling (winding around, rotating around) trend about a given point.

As an extension of vector calculus operators to physics, engineering and tensor spaces, Grad, Div and Curl operators also are often associated with [[Tensor calculus]] as well as vector calculus.&lt;ref name="Vector and Tensor Operators"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 0-393-92516-1 |url= https://www.amazon.com/Div-Grad-Curl-All-That/dp/0393925161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388768941&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=div+grad+curl |title=Div Grad Cural and All that |author=h.m. schey |location=New York|publisher=W W Norton|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5970">In [[science]], a '''parameter space''' is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible combinations of values for all the different [[parameter]]s contained in a particular [[mathematical model]]. The ranges of values of the parameters may form the axes of a [[Plot (graphics)|plot]], and particular outcomes of the model may be plotted against these axes to illustrate how different regions of the parameter space produce different types of behaviour in the model.

Often the parameters are inputs of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], in which case the technical term for the parameter space is [[domain of a function]].

Parameter spaces are particularly useful for describing families of [[probability distribution]]s that depend on parameters. More generally in science, the term parameter space is used to describe experimental variables. For example, the concept has been used in the science of [[soccer]] in the article "Parameter space for successful soccer kicks." In the study, "Success rates are determined through the use of four-dimensional parameter space volumes."&lt;ref&gt;Brandon G. Cook &amp; John Eric Goff (2006) [http://stacks.iop.org/EJP/27/865 Parameter Space for Successful Soccer Kicks] [[European Journal of Physics]] 27:865.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[statistics]], parameter spaces form the background for [[parameter estimation]].
As Ross describes in his book:&lt;ref&gt;Gavin J.S. Ross (1990) ''Nonlinear Estimation'', page 94, [[Springer-Verlag]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Parameter space is a subset of p-dimensional space consisting of the set of values of &amp;Theta; which are allowable in a particular model. The values may sometimes be constrained, say to the positive quadrant or the unit square, or in case of symmetry, to the triangular region where, say &lt;math&gt;\Theta_1 \le \Theta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The idea of intentionally truncating the parameter space has also been advanced elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constance van Eeden|Van Eeden, C.]] (2006)[https://books.google.com/books?id=m-MePzncfyAC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Restricted parameter space estimation problems: admissibility and minimaxity properties''], Springer {{ISBN|0-387-33747-4}} (p. 2)  "Gains in the minimax value can be very substantial when the parameter space is bounded."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* A simple model of health deterioration after developing [[lung cancer]] could include the two parameters gender&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gasperino |first=J. |author2=Rom, W. N. |year=2004 |title=Gender and lung cancer |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525730411701863 |journal=Clinical Lung Cancer |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=353–359 |doi= 10.3816/CLC.2004.n.013|pmid= |bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smoker/non-smoker, in which case the parameter space is the following set of four possibilities: {{math|{(Male, Smoker), (Male, Non-smoker), (Female, Smoker), (Female, Non-smoker)} }}.
* The [[logistic map]] &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1} = r x_n (1-x_n) &lt;/math&gt; has one parameter, ''r'', which can take any positive value. The parameter space is therefore [[positive real numbers]]. 
:For some values of ''r'', this function ends up cycling round a few values, or fixed on one value. These long-term values can be plotted against ''r'' in a [[bifurcation diagram]] to show the different behaviours of the function for different values of ''r''.

* In a [[sine wave]] model &lt;math&gt;y(t) = A \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi),&lt;/math&gt; the parameters are [[amplitude]] ''A'' &gt; 0, [[angular frequency]] ω &gt; 0, and [[phase (waves)|phase]] φ ∈ S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the parameter space is &lt;math&gt;R^+ \times R^+ \times S^1 .&lt;/math&gt;

* In [[complex dynamics]], the parameter space is the [[complex plane]] '''C''' = { ''z'' = ''x'' + ''y'' i : x, y ∈ '''R''' }, where i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1.

:The famous [[Mandelbrot set]] is a [[subset]] of this parameter space, consisting of the points in the complex plane which give a  [[bounded set]] of numbers when a particular [[iterated function]] is repeatedly applied from that starting point. The remaining points, which are not in the set, give an unbounded set of numbers (they tend to infinity) when this function is repeatedly applied from that starting point.

==History==
Parameter space contributed to the liberation of [[geometry]] from the confines of [[three-dimensional space]]. For instance, the parameter space of [[sphere (geometry)|spheres]] in three dimensions, has four dimensions—three for the sphere center and another for the radius.  According to [[Dirk Struik]], it was the book ''Neue Geometrie des Raumes'' (1849) by [[Julius Plücker]] that showed
:...geometry need not solely be based on points as basic elements. Lines, planes, circles, spheres can all be used as the elements (''Raumelemente'') on which a geometry can be based. This fertile conception threw new light on both synthetic and algebraic geometry and created new forms of duality. The number of dimensions of a particular form of geometry could now be any positive number, depending on the number of parameters necessary to define the "element".&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[Dirk Struik]] (1967) ''A Concise History of Mathematics'', 3rd edition, [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}
The requirement for higher dimensions is illustrated by [[Plücker coordinates|Plücker's line geometry]]. Struik writes
:[Plücker's] geometry of lines in three-space could be considered as a four-dimensional geometry, or, as [[Felix Klein|Klein]] has stressed, as the geometry of a four-dimensional [[quadric]] in a five-dimensional space.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|168}}
Thus the [[Klein quadric]] describes the parameters of lines in space.

In [[probability]] and [[statistics]],  '''point process notation''' comprises the range of [[mathematical notation]] used to symbolically represent [[random]] [[Mathematical object|objects]] known as [[point process]]es, which are used in related fields such as [[stochastic geometry]], [[spatial statistics]] and [[continuum percolation theory]] and frequently serve as [[mathematical models]] of random phenomena, representable as points, in time, space or both.

The notation varies due to the histories of certain mathematical fields and the different interpretations of point processes,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"&gt;D. Stoyan, W. S. Kendall, J. Mecke, and L. Ruschendorf. ''Stochastic geometry and its applications'', Second Edition, Section 4.1, Wiley Chichester, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/b97277 | first1 = D.

==Interpretation of point processes==

The notation, as well as the  terminology, of point processes depends on their setting and interpretation as mathematical objects which under certain assumptions can be interpreted as random [[sequences]] of points, random [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of points or random [[counting measure]]s.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

===Random sequences of points===

In some mathematical frameworks, a given point process may be considered as a sequence of points with each point randomly positioned in ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; as well as some other more abstract [[mathematical space]]s.  In general, whether  or not  a random sequence is equivalent to the other interpretations of a point process depends on the underlying mathematical space, but this holds true for the setting of finite-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daley | first1 = D.

===Random set of points===

A point process is called ''simple'' if no two (or more points) coincide in location with [[Almost surely|probability one]]. Given that often point processes are simple and the order of the points does not matter, a collection of random points can be considered as a random set of  points&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-38175-4_1 | first1 = A. | last1 = Baddeley | first2 = I. | last2 = Barany | first3 = R. | last3 = Schneider | first4 = W. | last4 = Weil| chapter = Spatial Point Processes and their Applications | title = Stochastic Geometry | series = Lecture Notes in Mathematics | volume = 1892 | pages = 1 | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-38174-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of random sets was independently developed by [[David George Kendall|David Kendall]] and [[Georges Matheron]]. In terms of being considered as a random set, a sequence of random points is a random closed set if the sequence has no [[Limit point#Types of limit points|accumulation points]] with probability one&lt;ref name="schneider2008stochastic"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = R. | last2 = Weil | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-78859-1 | title = Stochastic and Integral Geometry | series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-540-78858-4 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford university press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moller | first1 = J. | last2 = Plenge Waagepetersen | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1201/9780203496930 | title = Statistical Inference and Simulation for Spatial Point Processes | series = C&amp;H/CRC Monographs on Statistics &amp; Applied Probability | volume = 100 | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-58488-265-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;, and if the point process is considered as a random set, then the corresponding notation:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x\in {N}, &lt;/math&gt;

is used to denote that a random point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of (or [[Element (mathematics)#Notation and terminology|belongs]] to) the point  process &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The theory of random sets can be applied to point processes owing to this interpretation, which alongside the random sequence interpretation has resulted in a point process being written as:

:&lt;math&gt;  \{x_1, x_2,\dots \}=\{x\}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

which highlights its interpretation as either a random sequence or random closed set of points.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; Furthermore, sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_i&lt;/math&gt;) belongs to or is a point of the point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X&lt;/math&gt;, or with set notation, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;

===Random measures===

To denote the number of points of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; located in some [[Borel set]] &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt;, it is sometimes written &lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(B) =\#( B \cap {N}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \Phi(B)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;  \#&lt;/math&gt; is a [[counting measure]], which gives the number of points in some set. In this [[mathematical expression]] the point process is denoted by:

&lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, the symbol:

&lt;math&gt;  \Phi &lt;/math&gt;

represents the number of points of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of random measures,  one  can write:

&lt;math&gt;  \Phi(B)=n&lt;/math&gt;

to denote that there is the set &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;  n&lt;/math&gt; points of &lt;math&gt; {N}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a point process can be considered as a [[random measure]] that assigns some non-negative integer-valued [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]]  to sets.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; This interpretation has motivated a point process being considered just another name for a ''random counting measure''&lt;ref name="molvcanov2005theory"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/1-84628-150-4 | title = Theory of Random Sets | first = Ilya | last = Molchanov| series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-85233-892-X | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}} and the techniques of random measure theory offering another way to study point processes,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grandell1977point"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grandell | first1 = Jan | year = 1977 | title = Point Processes and Random Measures | journal = Advances in Applied Probability  | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 502–526 | publisher = Applied Probability Trust | jstor = 1426111 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also induces the use of the various notations used in [[Integral#Terminology and notation|integration]] and measure theory. {{efn|As discussed in Chapter 1 of Stoyan, Kendall and Mechke,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; varying [[integral]] notation in general applies to all integrals here and elsewhere.}}

==Dual notation==

The different interpretations of point processes as random sets and counting measures is captured with the often used notation &lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baccelli | first1 = F. O. | title = Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks: Volume I Theory | doi = 10.1561/1300000006 | journal = Foundations and Trends in Networking | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 249–449 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which:

* &lt;math&gt; {N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a set of random points.
* &lt;math&gt; {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a random variable that gives the number of points  of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; (hence it is a random counting measure).

Denoting the counting measure again with &lt;math&gt;  \#&lt;/math&gt;, this dual notation implies:

:&lt;math&gt; {N}(B) =\#(B \cap {N}). &lt;/math&gt;

==Sums==

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is some [[measurable function]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, then the sum of &lt;math&gt;  f(x)&lt;/math&gt; over all the points &lt;math&gt;  x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  {N} &lt;/math&gt; can be written in a number of ways &lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt; such as:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1) + f(x_2)+ \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

which has the random sequence appearance, or with set notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{x\in {N}}f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently, with integration notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{N}} f(x) {N}(dx) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \textbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Sample space|space]] of all possible counting measures, hence putting an  emphasis on the interpretation of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; as a random counting measure. An alternative integration notation may be used to write this integral as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{N}} f \, d{N} &lt;/math&gt;

The dual interpretation of point processes is illustrated when writing the number of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; points in a set &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt; {N}(B)= \sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[indicator function]] &lt;math&gt;  1_B(x) =1&lt;/math&gt; if the point &lt;math&gt;  x&lt;/math&gt; is exists in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; and zero otherwise, which in this setting is also known as a [[Dirac measure]].&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; In this expression the random measure interpretation is on the [[left-hand side]] while the random set notation is used is on the right-hand side.

==Expectations==

The [[average]] or [[expected value]] of a sum of functions over a point process is written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E\left[\sum_{x\in {N}}f(x)\right] \qquad \text{or} \qquad  \int_{\textbf{N}}\sum_{x\in {N}}f(x) P(d{N}), &lt;/math&gt;

where (in the random measure sense) &lt;math&gt;  P&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate [[probability measure]] defined on the space of [[counting measure]]s &lt;math&gt;  \textbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The expected value of &lt;math&gt;  {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt;  can be written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E[{N}(B)]=E\left( \sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x)\right) \qquad \text{or}  \qquad  \int_{\textbf{N}}\sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x) P(d{N}). &lt;/math&gt;

which is also known as the first [[moment measure]] of  &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The expectation of such a random sum, known as a ''shot noise process'' in the theory of point processes, can be calculated with [[Campbell's theorem (probability)#Campbell's theorem: general point process|Campbell's theorem]].&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"/&gt;

==Uses in other fields==

Point processes are employed in other mathematical and statistical disciplines, hence the notation may be used in fields such [[stochastic geometry]], [[spatial statistics]] or [[continuum percolation theory]], and areas which use the methods and theory from these fields.

A '''power law''' is a mathematical relationship between two quantities in which one is directly proportional to some power of the other. The '''power law for cache misses''' was first established by C. K. Chow in his 1974 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1974|title=On Optimization of Storage Hierarchies|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=18|issue=3|pages=194–203|doi=10.1147/rd.183.0194|last1=Chow|first1=C. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by experimental data on hit ratios for stack processing by [[Richard Mattson]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1971|title=Evaluation of multilevel memories|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|volume=7|issue=4|pages=814–819|doi=10.1109/TMAG.1971.1067237|last1=Mattson|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power law of cache misses can be used to narrow down the cache sizes to practical ranges, given a tolerable miss rate, as one of the early steps while designing the [[cache hierarchy]] for a uniprocessor system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|isbn=978-1482211184|last1=Solihin|first1=Yan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power law for cache misses can be stated as

: &lt;math&gt;M = M_0 C^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the miss rate for a cache of size ''C'' and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the miss rate of a baseline cache. The exponent ''α'' is workload-specific and typically ranges from 0.3 to 0.7.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartstein|first=A.|last2=Srinivasan|first2=V.|last3=Puzak|first3=T. R.|last4=Emma|first4=P. G.|date=2006-01-01|title=Cache Miss Behavior: Is It √2?|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1128022.1128064|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Computing Frontiers|series=CF '06|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=313–320|doi=10.1145/1128022.1128064|isbn=1595933026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Caveats ==
The power law can only give an estimate of the miss rate only up to a certain value of cache size. A large enough cache eliminates capacity misses and increasing the cache size further will not reduce the miss rate any further, contrary to the power law's prediction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The validity of the power law of cache misses also depends on the size of working memory set in a given process and also on the temporal re-reference pattern of cache blocks in a process. If a process has a small working memory set relative to the cache size, capacity misses are unlikely and the power law does not hold.

Although conflict misses reduce as associativity increases, Hartstein et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; showed that the power law holds irrespective of set associativity.

Hartstein et al. plotted the number of cache block re-accesses versus their re-reference times for a large number of workloads and found that most also follow an exponential relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;R(t) = R_0 t^{-\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R''(''t'') is the rate of re-referencing. It was found that the exponent ''β'' ranged between 1.7 and 1.3. Theoretically, it was proved that the power laws of cache re-reference and cache miss rate are related by the equation &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1-\beta&lt;/math&gt;. This means that for workloads that do not follow the re-reference power law, the power law of cache misses does not hold true.

== Multilevel cache hierarchy ==
In a multilevel cache hierarchy, the miss pattern of the higher level cache becomes the re-reference pattern of the immediate lower level cache. Hartstein et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; found that whereas the cache misses for lower levels do not follow a strict power law, as long as the lower level cache is considerably larger than the higher level cache, the miss rate function can be approximated to the power law.

In his 1557 work ''[[The Whetstone of Witte]]'', [[British people|British]] [[mathematician]] [[Robert Recorde]] proposed an exponent notation by [[prime factorisation]], which remained in use up until the eighteenth century and acquired the name ''Arabic exponent notation''.  The principle of Arabic exponents was quite similar to [[Egyptian fractions]]; large exponents were broken down into smaller prime numbers.  Squares and cubes were so called; prime numbers from five onwards were called ''sursolids''.

Although the terms used for defining exponents differed between authors and times, the general system was the primary exponent notation until [[René Descartes]] devised the Cartesian exponent notation, which is still used today.

This is a list of Recorde's terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13237">In [[mathematics]], a proof by '''infinite descent''' is a particular kind of [[proof by contradiction]] that relies on the [[least integer principle]]. One typical application is to show that a given equation has no solutions.

Typically, one shows that if a solution to a problem existed, which in some sense was related to one or more natural numbers, it would necessarily imply that a second solution existed, which was related to one or more 'smaller' natural numbers. This in turn would imply a third solution related to smaller natural numbers, implying a fourth solution, therefore a fifth solution, and so on. However, there cannot be an infinity of ever-smaller natural numbers, and therefore by [[mathematical induction]] (repeating the same step) the original premise&amp;mdash;that any solution exists&amp;mdash; is incorrect: its correctness produces a [[contradiction]].

An alternative way to express this is to assume one or more solutions or examples exists. Then there must be a smallest solution or example&amp;mdash;a [[minimal counterexample]]. We then prove that if a smallest solution exists, it must imply the existence of a smaller solution (in some sense)&amp;mdash;which again proves that the existence of any solution would lead to a contradiction.

The earliest uses of the method of infinite descent appear in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']]. A typical example is Proposition 31 of Book 7, in which [[Euclid]] proves that every composite integer is divided (in Euclid's terminology "measured") by some prime number. 

The method was much later developed by [[Fermat]], who coined the term and often used it for [[Diophantine equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = Number Theory: An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre | publisher = [[Birkhäuser Verlag|Birkhäuser]] | year = 1984 | pages = 75–79 | isbn = 0-8176-3141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two typical examples are showing the non-solvability of the Diophantine equation ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and proving [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], which states that an odd prime ''p'' can be expressed as a sum of two [[square number|squares]] only when ''p''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;([[Modular arithmetic|mod]]&amp;nbsp;4) (see [[Proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares#Euler.27s proof by infinite descent|proof]]). In some cases, to the modern eye, his "method of infinite descent" is an exploitation of the [[Inversive geometry|inversion]] of the doubling function for [[rational point]]s on an elliptic curve ''E''. The context is of a hypothetical non-trivial rational point on ''E''. Doubling a point on ''E'' roughly doubles the length of the numbers required to write it (as number of digits), so that a "halving" a point gives a rational with smaller terms. Since the terms are positive, they cannot decrease forever. In this way Fermat was able to show the non-existence of solutions in many cases of Diophantine equations of classical interest (for example, the problem of four perfect squares in [[arithmetic progression]]).

== Number theory==
In the [[number theory]] of the twentieth century, the infinite descent method was taken up again, and pushed to a point where it connected with the main thrust of [[algebraic number theory]] and the study of [[L-function]]s. The structural result of [[Mordell]], that the rational points on an elliptic curve ''E'' form a [[finitely-generated abelian group]], used an infinite descent argument based on ''E''/2''E'' in Fermat's style.

To extend this to the case of an [[abelian variety]] ''A'', [[André Weil]] had to make more explicit the way of quantifying the size of a solution, by means of a [[Glossary of arithmetic and Diophantine geometry#Height function|height function]] – a concept that became foundational. To show that ''A''(''Q'')/2''A''(''Q'') is finite, which is certainly a necessary condition for the finite generation of the group ''A''(''Q'') of rational points of ''A'', one must do calculations in what later was recognised as [[Galois cohomology]]. In this way, abstractly-defined cohomology groups in the theory become identified with ''descents'' in the tradition of Fermat. The [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] was at the start of what later became a very extensive theory.

== Application examples ==

=== Irrationality of {{radic|2}} ===
The proof that the [[square root of 2]] ({{radic|2}}) is [[irrational number|irrational]] (i.e. cannot be expressed as a fraction of two whole numbers) was discovered by the [[ancient Greek]]s, and is perhaps the earliest known example of a proof by infinite descent. [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] discovered that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its side, or in modern language, that the square root of two is [[irrational number|irrational]]. Little is known with certainty about the time or circumstances of this discovery, but the name of [[Hippasus]] of Metapontum is often mentioned. For a while, the Pythagoreans treated as an official secret the discovery that the square root of two is irrational, and, according to legend, Hippasus was murdered for divulging it.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie J. Morris, [http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt669/student.folders/morris.stephanie/emt.669/essay.1/pythagorean.html "The Pythagorean Theorem"], Dept. of Math. Ed., [[University of Georgia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Clegg, [http://nrich.maths.org/2671 "The Dangerous Ratio ..."], Nrich.org, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt von Fritz, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1969021 "The discovery of incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum"], Annals of Mathematics, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; The square root of two is occasionally called "Pythagoras' number" or "Pythagoras' Constant", for example {{harvtxt|Conway|Guy|1996}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[ancient Greek]]s, not having [[algebra]], worked out a [[Square root of 2#Geometric proof|geometric proof]] by infinite descent ([[John Horton Conway]] presented another [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/sq_root.shtml geometric proof (no. 8 ' ' ' )] by infinite descent that may be more accessible). The following is an [[algebra]]ic proof along similar lines:

Suppose that {{radic|2}} were [[rational number|rational]]. Then it could be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

for two natural numbers, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}. Then squaring would give

:&lt;math&gt;2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2q^2 = p^2, &lt;/math&gt;

so 2 must divide ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Because 2 is a [[prime number]], it must also divide ''p'', by [[Euclid's lemma]]. So ''p'' = 2''r'', for some integer ''r''.

But then

:&lt;math&gt;2q^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q^2 = 2r^2, &lt;/math&gt;

which shows that 2 must divide ''q'' as well. So ''q'' = 2''s'' for some integer ''s''.

This gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}=\frac{2r}{2s}=\frac{r}{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, if {{radic|2}} could be written as a rational number, it could always be written as a rational number with smaller parts, which itself could be written with yet-smaller parts, ''[[ad infinitum]]''. But [[Well-ordering principle|this is impossible in the set of natural numbers]].  Since {{radic|2}} is a [[real number]], which can be either rational or irrational, the only option left is for {{radic|2}} to be irrational.

(Alternatively, this proves that if {{radic|2}} were rational, no "smallest" representation as a fraction could exist, as any attempt to find a "smallest" representation ''p''/''q'' would imply a smaller one existed, which is a similar contradiction).

=== Irrationality of {{radic|''k''}} if it is not an integer ===

For positive integer ''k'', suppose that {{radic|''k''}} is not an integer, but is rational and can be expressed as &lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', and let ''q'' be the largest integer no greater than {{radic|''k''}}.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sqrt k &amp;=\frac mn\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{m(\sqrt k-q)}{n(\sqrt k-q)}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{m\sqrt k-mq}{n\sqrt k-nq}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{(n \sqrt k)\sqrt k-mq}{n (\frac{m}{n}) -nq}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{nk-mq}{m-nq}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The numerator and denominator were each multiplied by the expression ({{radic|''k''}} − ''q'')—which is positive but less than 1—and then simplified independently. So two resulting products, say ''m' '' and ''n' '', are themselves integers, which are less than ''m'' and ''n'' respectively.  Therefore, no matter what natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'' are used to express {{radic|''k''}}, there exist smaller natural numbers ''m' '' &lt; ''m'' and ''n' '' &lt; ''n'' that have the same ratio.  But infinite descent on the natural numbers is impossible, so this disproves the original assumption that {{radic|''k''}} could be expressed as a ratio of natural numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sagher | first = Yoram |date=February 1988 | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 95 | page = 117 | title = What Pythagoras could have done | doi=10.2307/2323064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-solvability of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''s''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and its permutations===
{{See also|Fermat's right triangle theorem#Fermat's proof}}

The non-solvability of &lt;math&gt;r^2 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; in integers is sufficient to show the non-solvability of &lt;math&gt;q^4 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; in integers, which is a special case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and the historical proofs of the latter proceeded by more broadly proving the former using infinite descent. The following more recent proof demonstrates both of these impossibilities by proving still more broadly that a [[Pythagorean triangle]] cannot have any two of its sides each either a square or twice a square, since there is no smallest such triangle:&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Stan, "Fermat's method of ''descente infinie''", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 95, July 2011, 269–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose there exists such a Pythagorean triangle. Then it can be scaled down to give a primitive (i.e., with no common factors other than 1) Pythagorean triangle with the same property. Primitive Pythagorean triangles' sides can be written as &lt;math&gt;x=2ab,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y=a^2-b^2,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;, with ''a'' and ''b'' [[coprime|relatively prime]] and with ''a+b'' odd and hence ''y'' and ''z'' both odd. The property that ''y'' and ''z'' are each odd means that neither  ''y'' nor ''z'' can be twice a square. Furthermore, if ''x'' is a square or twice a square, then each of ''a'' and ''b'' is a square or twice a square. There are three cases, depending on which two sides are postulated to each be a square or twice a square:

*'''''y'' and ''z''''': In this case ''y'' and ''z'' are both squares. But then the right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{yz}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; also would have integer sides including a square leg (&lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;) and a square hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt;), and would have a smaller hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;).
*'''''z'' and ''x''''': ''z'' is a square. The integer right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; also would have two sides (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) each of which is a square or twice a square, and a smaller hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; compared to {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
*'''''y'' and ''x''''': ''y'' is a square. The integer right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; would have two sides (''b'' and ''a'') each of which is a square or twice a square, with a smaller hypotenuse than the original triangle (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;).

In any of these cases, one Pythagorean triangle with two sides each of which is a square or twice a square has led to a smaller one, which in turn would lead to a smaller one, etc.; since such a sequence cannot go on infinitely, the original premise that such a triangle exists must be wrong.

This implies that the equations
:&lt;math&gt;r^2 + s^4 = t^4,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r^4 + s^2 =t^4,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;r^4 + s^4 =t^2&lt;/math&gt;
cannot have non-trivial solutions, since non-trivial solutions would give Pythagorean triangles with two sides being squares.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27765">A '''proof of impossibility''', also known as '''negative proof''', proof of an '''impossibility theorem''', or '''negative result''', is a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] demonstrating that a particular problem cannot be solved, or cannot be solved in general. Often proofs of impossibility have put to rest decades or centuries of work attempting to find a solution. To prove that something is impossible is usually much harder than the opposite task; it is necessary to develop a theory.&lt;ref&gt;Pudlák, pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt; Impossibility theorems are usually expressible as universal propositions in logic (see [[universal quantification]]).

One of the most famous proofs of impossibility was the 1882 proof of [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]], showing that the ancient problem of [[squaring the circle]] cannot be solved, because the number [[Pi|{{math|π}}]] is [[Transcendental number|transcendental]] (non-algebraic) and only a subset of the [[algebraic numbers]] can be constructed by compass and straightedge. Two other classical problems—[[trisection|trisecting the general angle]] and [[doubling the cube]]—were also proved impossible in the nineteenth century.

A problem arising in the sixteenth century was that of creating a general formula using radicals expressing the solution of any polynomial equation of fixed degree ''k'', where ''k'' ≥ 5. In the 1820s, the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] showed this to be impossible using concepts such as [[solvable group]]s from [[Galois theory]], a new subfield of [[abstract algebra]].

Among the most important proofs of impossibility of the 20th century, were those related to [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], which showed that there are problems that cannot be solved in general by any algorithm at all. The most famous is the [[halting problem]].

In [[computational complexity theory]], techniques like relativization (see [[oracle machine]]) provide "weak" proofs of impossibility excluding certain proof techniques. Other techniques like proofs of [[Completeness (logic)|completeness]] for a [[complexity class]] provide evidence for the difficulty of problems by showing them to be just as hard to solve as other known problems that have proved [[Intractability (complexity)|intractable]].

==Types of impossibility proof==
{{See also|Types of proof}}

===Proof by contradiction===
One widely used type of impossibility proof is [[proof by contradiction]]. In this type of proof it is shown that if something, such as a solution to a particular class of equations, were possible, then two mutually contradictory things would be true, such as a number being both even and odd. The contradiction implies that the original premise is impossible.

====Proof by descent====
{{Main|Proof by infinite descent}}

One type of proof by contradiction is proof by [[infinite descent|descent]]. Here it is postulated that something is possible, such as a solution to a class of equations, and that therefore there must be a smallest solution; then starting from the allegedly smallest solution, it is shown that a smaller solution can be found, contradicting the premise that the former solution was the smallest one possible. Thus the premise that a solution exists must be false.

This method of proof can also be interpreted slightly differently, as the method of ''infinite descent''. One postulates that a positive integer solution exists, whether or not it is the smallest one, and one shows that based on this solution a smaller solution must exist. But by [[mathematical induction]] it follows that a still smaller solution must exist, then a yet smaller one, and so on for an infinite number of steps. But this contradicts the fact that one cannot find smaller and smaller positive integers indefinitely; the contradiction implies that the premise that a solution exists is wrong.

==Types of disproof of impossibility conjectures==
There are two alternative methods of proving wrong a conjecture that something is impossible: by counterexample ([[constructive proof]]) and by logical contradiction ([[non-constructive proof]]).

The obvious way to disprove an impossibility conjecture by providing a single [[counterexample]]. For example, [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture|Euler proposed]] that at least ''n'' different ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; powers were necessary to sum to yet another ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power. The conjecture was disproved in 1966 with a counterexample involving a count of only four different 5th powers summing to another fifth power:
:27&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 84&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 110&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 133&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 144&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.
A proof by counterexample is a [[constructive proof]].

In contrast, a [[non-constructive proof]] that something is ''not'' impossible proceeds by showing it is logically contradictory for ''all'' possible counterexamples to be invalid: At least ''one'' of the items on a list of possible counterexamples must actually be a valid counterexample to the impossibility conjecture. For example, a conjecture that it is impossible for an irrational power raised to an irrational power to be rational [[Irrational number#Irrational powers|was disproved]] by showing that one of two possible counterexamples must be a valid counterexample, without showing which one it is.

==The existence of irrational numbers: The Pythagoreans' proof==
The proof by [[Pythagoras]] (or more likely one of his students) about 500&amp;nbsp;[[BCE]] has had a profound effect on mathematics. It shows that the [[square root of 2]] cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers (counting numbers). The proof bifurcated "the numbers" into two non-overlapping collections—the [[rational numbers]] and the [[irrational numbers]]. This bifurcation was used by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] in his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal method]], which in turn was used by Turing in his proof that the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (the [[decision problem]] of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]) is undecidable.

{{quote|text=It is unknown when, or by whom, the "theorem of Pythagoras" was discovered. The discovery can hardly have been made by Pythagoras himself, but it was certainly made in his school. Pythagoras lived about 570&amp;ndash;490&amp;nbsp;BCE. Democritus, born about 470&amp;nbsp;BCE, wrote ''on irrational lines and solids''&amp;nbsp;...|source={{citation needed|date=July 2017}}|author=Heath}}

Proofs followed for various square roots of the primes up to 17.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is a famous passage in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' in which it is stated that [[Teodorus]] (Plato's teacher) proved the irrationality of
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, ...,&lt;/math&gt;
taking all the separate cases up to the root of 17&amp;nbsp;square feet&amp;nbsp;...&amp;thinsp;.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright, p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A more general proof now exists that:

:The ''m''th root of an integer ''N'' is irrational, unless ''N'' is the ''m''th power of an integer ''n''".&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright, p.&amp;nbsp;40&lt;/ref&gt;

That is,  it is impossible to express the ''m''th root of an integer ''N'' as the ratio {{frac|''a''|''b''}} of two integers ''a'' and ''b'' that share no common [[prime factor]] except in cases in which ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

==Impossible constructions sought by the ancient Greeks==
Three famous questions of [[compass and straightedge constructions|Greek geometry]] were how:

# ...&amp;nbsp;with compass and straight-edge to [[trisect any angle]],
# to construct a cube with a volume [[Doubling the cube|twice the volume of a given cube]]
# to construct a square [[squaring the circle|equal in area]] to that of a given circle.

For more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;years unsuccessful attempts were made to solve these problems; at last, in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century it was proved that the desired constructions are logically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel and Newman p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth problem of the ancient Greeks was to construct an [[equilateral polygon]] with a specified number ''n'' of sides, beyond the basic cases ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, 4, 5 that they knew how to construct.

All of these are problems in [[Constructible number|Euclidean construction]], and Euclidean constructions can be done only if they involve only [[Euclidean number]]s (by definition of the latter) (Hardy and Wright p.&amp;nbsp;159). Irrational numbers can be Euclidean. A good example is the irrational number the square root of 2. It is simply the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs both one unit in length, and it can be constructed with straightedge and compass. But it was proved centuries after Euclid that Euclidean numbers cannot involve any operations other than addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of square roots.

===Angle trisection and doubling the cube===
Both [[trisecting the angle|trisecting the general angle]] and [[doubling the cube]] require taking [[cube root]]s, which are not [[constructible numbers]] by compass and straightedge.

===Squaring the circle===
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[Euclidean number]] ... and therefore it is impossible to construct, by Euclidean methods a length equal to the circumference of a circle of unit diameter&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A proof exists to demonstrate that any Euclidean number is an [[algebraic number]]—a number that is the solution to some [[polynomial equation]]. Therefore, because &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; was proved in 1882 to be a [[transcendental number]] and thus by definition not an algebraic number, it is not a Euclidean number. Hence the construction of a length &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; from a unit circle is impossible&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright p.&amp;nbsp;159 referenced by E. Hecke. (1923). ''Vorlesungen über die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen''. Leipzig: Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft&lt;/ref&gt;, and the circle cannot be squared.

===Constructing an equilateral ''n''-gon===
The [[Constructible polygon#Conditions for constructibility|Gauss-Wantzel theorem]] showed in 1837 that constructing an equilateral ''n''-gon is impossible for most values of ''n''.

==Euclid's parallel axiom==

Nagel and Newman consider the question raised by the [[parallel postulate]] to be "...perhaps the most significant development in its long-range effects upon subsequent mathematical history" (p.&amp;nbsp;9).

The question is: can the axiom that two parallel lines "...will not meet even 'at infinity'" (footnote, ibid) be derived from the other axioms of Euclid's geometry? It was not until work in the nineteenth century by "... Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann, that the impossibility of deducing the parallel axiom from the others was demonstrated. This outcome was of the greatest intellectual importance. ...a ''proof'' can be given of the ''impossibility of proving'' certain propositions [in this case, the parallel postlate] within a given system [in this case, Euclid's first four postulates]". (p.&amp;nbsp;10)

==Fermat's Last Theorem==
{{Main|Fermat's Last Theorem}}

[[Fermat's Last Theorem]] was conjectured by [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the 1600s, states the impossibility of finding solutions in positive integers for the equation &lt;math&gt;x^n+y^n=z^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] himself gave a proof for the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 case using his technique of [[infinite descent]], and other special cases were subsequently proved, but the general case was not proved until 1994 by [[Andrew Wiles]].

==Richard's paradox==
{{Main|Richard's paradox}}
This profound paradox presented by [[Jules Richard]] in 1905 informed the work of [[Kurt Gödel]] (cf Nagel and Newman p.&amp;nbsp;60ff) and Alan Turing. A succinct definition is found in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/AAT3201.0001.001/86?rgn=full+text;view=pdf ''Principia Mathematica'', 2nd edition 1927, p.&amp;nbsp;61, 64] in [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=AAT3201.0001.001 ''Principia Mathematica online'', Vol.1] at University of Michigan Historical Math Collection&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{quote|text=Richard's paradox ... is as follows. Consider all decimals that can be defined by means of a '''finite number of''' '''''words''''' &lt;small&gt;[“words” are symbols; boldface added for emphasis]&lt;/small&gt;; let ''E'' be the class of such decimals. Then ''E'' has &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;small&gt;[an infinite number of]&lt;/small&gt; terms; hence its members can be ordered as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... Let ''X'' be a number defined as follows &lt;small&gt;[Whitehead &amp; Russell now employ the Cantor diagonal method]&lt;/small&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;If the ''n''-th figure in the ''n''-th decimal is ''p'', let the ''n''-th figure in ''X'' be ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (or 0, if ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9). Then ''X'' is different from all the members of ''E'', since, whatever finite value ''n'' may have, the ''n''-th figure in ''X'' is different from the ''n''-th figure in the ''n''-th of the decimals composing ''E'', and therefore ''X'' is different from the ''n''-th decimal. Nevertheless we have defined ''X'' in a finite number of words &lt;small&gt;[i.e. this very definition of “word” above.]&lt;/small&gt; and therefore ''X'' ought to be a member of ''E''. Thus ''X'' both is and is not a member of E.|source=''Principia Mathematica'', 2nd edition 1927, p.&amp;nbsp;61}}

Kurt Gödel considered his proof to be “an analogy” of Richard's paradox, which he called “''Richard's antinomy''”.&lt;ref&gt;Gödel in ''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; See more below about Gödel's proof.

[[Alan Turing]] constructed this paradox with a machine and proved that this machine could not answer a simple question: will this machine be able to determine if any machine (including itself) will become trapped in an unproductive ‘[[infinite loop]]’ (i.e. it fails to continue its computation of the diagonal number).

==Can this theorem be proved from these axioms? Gödel's proof==
{{Main|Gödel's incompleteness theorems}}
To quote Nagel and Newman (p.&amp;nbsp;68), "Gödel's paper is difficult. Forty-six preliminary definitions, together with several important preliminary theorems, must be mastered before the main results are reached" (p.&amp;nbsp;68). In fact, Nagel and Newman required a 67-page introduction to their exposition of the proof. But if the reader feels strong enough to tackle the paper, Martin Davis observes that "This remarkable paper is not only an intellectual landmark, but is written with a clarity and vigor that makes it a pleasure to read" (Davis in Undecidable, p.&amp;nbsp;4). It is recommended{{By whom|date=August 2010}} that most readers see Nagel and Newman first.

So what did Gödel prove? In his own words:

: "It is reasonable... to make the conjecture that ...[the] axioms [from [[Principia Mathematica]] and [[Peano]] ] are ... sufficient to decide all mathematical questions which can be formally expressed in the given systems. In what follows it will be shown that this is not the case, but rather that ... there exist relatively simple problems of the theory of ordinary whole numbers which cannot be decided on the basis of the axioms" (Gödel in Undecidable, p. 4).

Gödel compared his proof to "Richard's antinomy" (an "[[antinomy]]" is a contradiction or a paradox; for more see [[Richard's paradox]]):

: "The analogy of this result with Richard's antinomy is immediately evident; there is also a close relationship [14] with the [[Liar Paradox]] (Gödel's footnote 14: Every [[epistemological]] antinomy can be used for a similar proof of undecidability)... Thus we have a proposition before us which asserts its own unprovability [15]. (His footnote 15: Contrary to appearances, such a proposition is not circular, for, to begin with, it asserts the unprovability of a quite definite formula)" (Gödel in Undecidable, p.9).

==Will this computing machine lock in a "circle"? Turing's first proof==
* The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'', the [[decision problem]], was first answered by Church in April 1935 and preempted Turing by over a year, as Turing's paper was received for publication in May 1936. (Also received for publication in 1936—in October, later than Turing's—was a short paper by Emil Post that discussed the reduction of an algorithm to a simple machine-like "method" very similar to Turing's computing machine model (see [[Post–Turing machine]] for details).
* Turing's proof is made difficult by number of definitions required and its subtle nature. See [[Turing machine]] and [[Turing's proof]] for details.
* Turing's first proof (of three) follows the schema of Richard's Paradox: Turing's computing machine is an algorithm represented by a string of seven letters in a "computing machine". Its "computation" is to test ''all'' computing machines (including itself) for "circles", and form a diagonal number from the computations of the non-circular or "successful" computing machines. It does this, starting in sequence from 1, by converting the numbers (base 8) into strings of seven letters to test. When it arrives at its own number, it creates ''its own'' letter-string. It decides it is the letter-string of a successful machine, but when it tries to do this machine's (''its own'') computation it locks in a circle and can't continue. Thus we have arrived at Richard's paradox. (If you are bewildered see Turing's proof for more).

A number of similar undecidability proofs appeared soon before and after Turing's proof:

# April 1935: Proof of [[Alonzo Church]] (''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory''). His proof was to "...propose a definition of effective calculability ... and to show, by means of an example, that not every problem of this class is solvable" (Undecidable p.&amp;nbsp;90))
# 1946: [[Post correspondence problem]] (cf Hopcroft and Ullman&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"&gt;{{cite book| author=[[John E. Hopcroft]], [[Jeffrey D. Ullman]]| title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=1979| publisher=Addison-Wesley| isbn=0-201-02988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;193ff, p.&amp;nbsp;407 for the reference)
# April 1947: Proof of [[Emil Post]] (''Recursive Unsolvability of a Problem of Thue'') (Undecidable p.&amp;nbsp;293). This has since become known as "The Word problem of Thue" or "Thue's Word Problem" ([[Axel Thue]] proposed this problem in a paper of 1914 (cf References to Post's paper in Undecidable, p.&amp;nbsp;303)).
# [[Rice's theorem]]: a generalized formulation of Turing's second theorem (cf Hopcroft and Ullman&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;185ff)&lt;ref&gt;"...there can be no machine E which ... will determine whether M [an arbitrary machine] ever prints a given symbol (0 say)" (Undecidable p. 134). Turing makes an odd assertion at the end of this proof that sounds remarkably like Rice's Theorem:
:"...each of these "general process" problems can be expressed as a problem concerning a general process for determining whether a given integer n has a property G(n)... and this is equivalent to computing a number whose nth figure is 1 if G(n) is true and 0 if it is false" (Undecidable p 134). Unfortunately he doesn't clarify the point further, and the reader is left confused.
&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Greibach's theorem]]: undecidability in language theory (cf Hopcroft and Ullman&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;205ff and reference on p.&amp;nbsp;401 ibid: [[Sheila Greibach|Greibach]] [1963] "The undecidability of the ambiguity problem for minimal lineal grammars," ''Information and Control'' 6:2, 117–125, also reference on p.&amp;nbsp;402 ibid: Greibach [1968] "A note on undecidable properties of formal languages", Math Systems Theory 2:1, 1–6.)
# [[Penrose tiling]] questions
# Question of solutions for [[Diophantine equations]] and the resultant answer in the MRDP Theorem; see entry below.

==Can this string be compressed? Chaitin's proof==
{{Main|Chaitin's incompleteness theorem}}
For an exposition suitable for non-specialists see Beltrami p.&amp;nbsp;108ff. Also see Franzen Chapter 8 pp.&amp;nbsp;137–148, and Davis pp.&amp;nbsp;263–266. Franzén's discussion is significantly more complicated than Beltrami's and delves into Ω—[[Gregory Chaitin]]'s so-called "halting probability". Davis's older treatment approaches the question from a [[Turing machine]] viewpoint. Chaitin has written a number of books about his endeavors and the subsequent philosophic and mathematical fallout from them.

A string is [[Kolmogorov complexity#Kolmogorov randomness|called]] ''(algorithmically) random'' if it cannot be produced from any shorter computer program. While [[Kolmogorov complexity#Compression|most strings are random]], no particular one can be proved so, except for finitely many short ones:

: "A paraphrase of Chaitin's result is that there can be no formal proof that a sufficiently long string is random..." (Beltrami p. 109)

Beltrami observes that "Chaitin's proof is related to a paradox posed by Oxford librarian G. Berry early in the twentieth century that asks for 'the smallest positive integer that cannot be defined by an English sentence with fewer than 1000 characters.' Evidently, the shortest definition of this number must have at least 1000 characters. However, the sentence within quotation marks, which is itself a definition of the alleged number is less than 1000 characters in length!" (Beltrami, p.&amp;nbsp;108)

==Does this Diophantine equation have an integer solution? Hilbert's tenth problem==
{{Main|Matiyasevich's theorem|Hilbert's problems}}

The question "Does any arbitrary "Diophantine equation" have an integer solution?" is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]].That is, it is impossible to answer the question for all cases.

Franzén introduces [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] and the [[Matiyasevich's theorem|MRDP theorem]] (Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem) which states that "no algorithm exists which can decide whether or not a Diophantine equation has ''any'' solution at all".  MRDP uses the undecidability proof of Turing: "... the set of solvable Diophantine equations is an example of a computably enumerable but not decidable set, and the set of unsolvable Diophantine equations is not computably enumerable" (p.&amp;nbsp;71).

==In social science==
In [[political science]], [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that it is impossible to devise a [[voting system]] that satisfies a set of five specific axioms. This theorem is proved by showing that four of the axioms together imply the opposite of the fifth.

In [[economics]], [[Holmström's theorem]] is an impossibility theorem proving that no incentive system for a team of agents can satisfy all of three desirable criteria.

==In natural science==
In [[natural science]], impossibility assertions (like other assertions) come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proved to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible.

Two examples of widely accepted impossibilities in [[physics]] are [[perpetual motion machine]]s, which violate the law of [[conservation of energy]], and exceeding the [[speed of light]], which violates the implications of [[special relativity]]. Another is the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[quantum mechanics]], which asserts the impossibility of simultaneously knowing both the position and the momentum of a particle. Also [[Bell's theorem]]: no physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.

While an impossibility assertion in science can never be absolutely proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single [[counterexample]]. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6083">'''Psychologism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] position, according to which [[psychology]] plays a central role in grounding or explaining some other, non-psychological type of fact or law.

==Overview==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''psychologism'' as: "The view or doctrine that a theory of psychology or ideas forms the basis of an account of metaphysics, epistemology, or meaning; (sometimes) spec. the explanation or derivation of mathematical or logical laws in terms of psychological facts."&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologism in [[epistemology]], the idea that its problems "can be solved satisfactorily by the psychological study of the development of mental processes", was argued in [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Psychologism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of psychologism are logical psychologism and mathematical psychologism. Logical psychologism is a position in [[logic]] (or the philosophy of logic) according to which [[Classical logic|logical laws]] and [[mathematics|mathematical]] laws are grounded in, derived from, explained or exhausted by psychological facts or laws. Psychologism in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is the position that mathematical concepts and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts or laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaun Gallagher|Gallagher, S.]], ''Phenomenology'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=c7sYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 20].&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was coined by [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]] as ''Psychologismus'', being translated into English as ''psychologism''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/ Psychologism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Kusch|Kusch, M.]], ''Psychologism: The Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge'' (London &amp; New York: [[Routledge]], 1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JJuIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 101].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] was accused by [[Edmund Husserl]] of being an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, although this may not have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;Skorupski, JM., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ghesAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=psychologism+mill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GWNsVPvSHNf3aorHgdgD&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=psychologism%20mill&amp;f=false ''Mill (Arguments of the Philosophers)''], Routledge, 2010, pp. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; So were many nineteenth-century German philosophers such as [[Christoph von Sigwart]], [[Benno Erdmann]],  [[Theodor Lipps]], [[Gerardus Heymans]], [[Wilhelm Jerusalem]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Elsenhans|de}},&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/#ExaPsyRea Psychologism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy): "Examples of Psychologistic Reasoning"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of psychologists, past and present (e.g., [[Wilhelm Wundt]]&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; and [[Gustave Le Bon]]&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Szacki, ''History of Sociological Thought'', Greenwood Press, 1979, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Psychologism was notably criticized by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his [[anti-psychologistic]] work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', and many of his works and essays, including his review of Husserl's ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, G. E. R., ''A Critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Gottlob Frege'' ([[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]: [[Routledge]], 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wsi1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=pl#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl, in the first volume of his ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'', called "The Prolegomena of Pure Logic", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. Frege's arguments were largely ignored, while Husserl's were widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kusch |first=Martin |authorlink= |date=November 7, 2011 |coauthors= |title=Psychologism |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/ |doi= |id= |accessdate=Nov 19, 2014 |ref=harvnb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Psychologism and Behaviorism", [[Ned Block]] takes psychologism as the position that "whether behavior is intelligent behavior depends on the character of the internal information processing that produces it." This is in contrast to a behavioral view which would state that intelligence can be ascribed to a being solely via observing its behavior. This latter type of behavioral view is strongly associated with the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Raymond Clare Archibald was born in South Branch, Stewiacke, [[Nova Scotia]] on 7 October 1875. He was the son of Abram Newcomb Archibald (1849—1883) and Mary Mellish Archibald (1849—1901).  He was the fourth cousin twice removed of the famous Canadian-American astronomer and mathematician [[Simon Newcomb]] (1835—1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tatersall|first=James|author2=Shawnee McMurran |title=Raymond Clare Archibald: His Life and Work|journal=Proc. Can. Soc. Hist. Phil. Math.|year=2004|volume=17|pages=241–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald graduated in 1894 from [[Mount Allison University|Mount Allison College]] with B.A. degree in mathematics and teacher's certificate in violin.  After teaching mathematics and violin for a year at the Mount Allison Ladies’ College he went to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he received a B.A. 1896 and a M.A. in 1897.  He then traveled to Europe where he attended the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] during 1898 and received a Ph.D.cum laude from the [[University of Strasbourg|University of Strassburg]] in 1900.  His advisor was Karl Theodor Reye and title of his dissertation was The [[Cardioid]]e and Some of its Related Curves.

He returned to [[Canada]] in 1900 and taught mathematics and violin at the Mount Allison Ladies’ College until 1907.  After a one-year appointment at Acadia University he accepted an invitation of join the mathematics department at [[Brown University]].  He stayed at Brown for the rest of his career becoming a Professor Emeritus in 1943.  While at Brown he created one of the finest mathematical libraries in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archibald|first=Raymond|title=From Martha Mitchell’s Encyclopedia Brunoniana|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0430|work=From Martha Mitchell’s Encyclopedia Brunoniana|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald returned to Mount Allison in 1954 to curate the Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library, the library he had founded in 1905 to honor his mother.  At his death the library contained 23,000 volumes, 2,700 records, and 70,000 songs in American and English poetry and drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archibald|first=Raymond|title=Raymond Clare Archibald|url=http://www.mta.ca/libraryhistory/r_c_archibald.html|work=Pages Through The Ages|publisher=Mount Allison University|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond Clare Archibald was a world-renowned historian of mathematics with a lifelong concern for the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools.  At the presentation of his portrait to Brown University the head of the mathematics department, Professor [[Clarence Raymond Adams]] (1898–1965) said of him:

"The instincts of the bibliophile were also his from early years.  Possessing a passion for accurate detail, systematic by nature and blessed with a memory that was the marvel of his friends, he gradually acquired a knowledge of mathematical books and their values which has scarcely been equalled.  This knowledge and an untiring energy he dedicated to the upbuilding of the mathematical library at [[Brown University]].  From modest beginnings he has developed this essential equipment of the mathematical investigator to a point where it has no superior, in completeness and in convenience for the user."

==Honors==
Archibald received honorary degrees from the [[University of Padua]] (LL.D., 1922), [[Mount Allison University]] (LL.D., 1923) and from [[Brown University]] (M.A. ad eundem, 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarton|first=George|title=Raymond Clare Archibald|journal=Osiris|year=1956|volume=12|pages=4–34|doi=10.1086/368594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The book was reviewed by Pierre Kerszberg for ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' and by [[Michael S. Mahoney]] for ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]''. Mahoney says "The title should have a question mark." He sets the context by referring to [[paradigm shift]]s that characterize scientific revolutions as described by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in his book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. According to Michael Crowe in chapter one, revolutions never occur in mathematics. Mahoney explains how mathematics grows upon itself and does not discard earlier gains in understanding with new ones, such as happens in biology, physics, or other sciences.  A nuanced version of revolution in mathematics is described by Caroline Dunmore who sees change at the level of "meta-mathematical values of the community that define the telos and methods of the subject, and encapsulate general beliefs about its value." On the other hand, reaction to innovation in mathematics is noted, resulting in "clashes of intellectual and social values".

[[File:KsiegaSzkocka1.JPG|thumb|Part of the Scottish Book with notes of [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]].]]

The '''Scottish Book''' ({{lang-pl|Księga Szkocka}}) was a thick notebook used by mathematicians of the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] in Poland for jotting down problems meant to be solved. The notebook was named after the "[[Scottish Café]]" where it was kept.

Originally, the mathematicians who gathered at the cafe would write down the problems and equations directly on the cafe's marble table tops, but these would be erased at the end of each day, and so the record of the preceding discussions would be lost. The idea for the book was most likely originally suggested by [[Stefan Banach]], or his wife, Łucja, who purchased a large notebook and left it with the proprietor of the cafe.&lt;ref name="Raikhel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Visser" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Lwow - Kawiarnia Szkocka.jpg|thumb|The building of the Scottish cafe where the book was recorded and stored]]
[[File:MazurGes.jpg|thumb |1972: [[Stanislaw Mazur|Mazur]] (left) acknowledges [[Per Enflo]] with the promised "live goose", the prize for having solved the [[approximation problem|problem 153]].]]

The Scottish Café ({{lang-pl|Kawiarnia Szkocka}}) was the café in [[Lviv|Lwów]] (now ''Lviv'') where, in the 1930s and 1940s, mathematicians from the [[Lwów School of Mathematics|Lwów School]] collaboratively discussed [[mathematical problem|research problem]]s, particularly in [[functional analysis]] and [[general topology|topology]].

[[Stanislaw Ulam]] recounts that the tables of the café had [[marble]] tops, so they could write in pencil, directly on the table, during their discussions. To keep the results from being lost, and after becoming annoyed with their writing directly on the table tops, [[Stefan Banach]]'s wife provided the mathematicians with a large notebook, which was used for writing the problems and answers and eventually became known as the ''Scottish Book''. The book—a collection of solved, unsolved, and even probably unsolvable problems—could be borrowed by any of the guests of the café. Solving any of the problems was rewarded with prizes, with the most difficult and challenging problems having expensive prizes (during the [[Great Depression]] and on the eve of [[World War II]]), such as a bottle of fine brandy.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

For problem 153, which was later recognized as being closely related to Stefan Banach's "[[approximation problem|basis problem]]", [[Stanisław Mazur]] offered the prize of a live goose. This problem was solved only in 1972 by [[Per Enflo]], who was presented with the live goose in a ceremony that was broadcast throughout Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin, ed.; Kaluza.&lt;/ref&gt;

The café building used to house the {{Interlanguage link multi|Universal Bank (Ukraine)|uk|3=Універсал Банк|lt=Universal Bank}} at the street address of 27 [[Taras Shevchenko]] Prospekt. The original cafe was renovated in May 2014 and contains a copy of the Scottish Book.

==Problems contributed by individual authors==

A total of 193 problems were written down in the book.&lt;ref name="Raikhel" /&gt; [[Stanisław Mazur]] contributed a total of 43 problems, 24 of them as a single author and 19 together with Stefan Banach.&lt;ref name="mazur" /&gt; Banach himself wrote 14, plus another 11 with [[Stanislaw Ulam]] and Mazur. Ulam wrote 40 problems and additional 15 ones with others.&lt;ref name="Raikhel" /&gt;

During the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation of Lwów]], several Russian mathematicians visited the city and also added problems to the book.&lt;ref name="Visser" /&gt;

[[Hugo Steinhaus]] contributed the last one in May 1941 (other sources give March 1941), which involved a question about the [[probability distribution|likely distribution]] of matches within a matchbox—a problem motivated by Banach's habit of chain smoking cigarettes—shortly before the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Raikhel" /&gt;

== Continuity ==
After World War II, an English translation annotated by Ulam was published by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Ulam" /&gt; After World War II, Steinhaus at the [[University of Wrocław]] revived the tradition of the Scottish book by initiating ''The New Scottish Book''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5084">{{Other uses|Socle (disambiguation){{!}}Socle}}
In [[mathematics]], the term '''socle''' has several related meanings.

==Socle of a group==
In the context of [[group theory]], the '''socle of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]''' ''G'', denoted soc(''G''), is the [[subgroup]] generated by the [[minimal normal subgroup]]s of ''G''. It can happen that a group has no minimal non-trivial normal subgroup (that is, every non-trivial normal subgroup properly contains another such subgroup) and in that case the socle is defined to be the subgroup generated by the identity. The socle is a direct product of minimal normal subgroups.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|loc=p.87}}

As an example, consider the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; with [[generating set of a group|generator]] ''u'', which has two minimal normal subgroups, one generated by ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 4&lt;/sup&gt; (which gives a normal subgroup with 3 elements) and the other by ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 6&lt;/sup&gt; (which gives a normal subgroup with 2 elements). Thus the socle of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the group generated by ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 4&lt;/sup&gt; and ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 6&lt;/sup&gt;, which is just the group generated by ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The socle is a [[characteristic subgroup]], and hence a normal subgroup. It is not necessarily [[Transitively normal subgroup|transitively normal]], however.

If a group G is a finite [[solvable group]], then the socle can be expressed as a product of [[elementary abelian]] [[p-group]]s. Thus, in this case, it is just a product of copies of '''Z/pZ''' for various '''p''' where the same '''p''' may occur multiple times in the product.

==Socle of a module==
In the context of [[module theory]] and [[ring theory]] the '''socle of a [[module (mathematics)|module]]''' ''M'' over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is defined to be the sum of the minimal nonzero submodules of ''M''. It can be considered as a [[duality (mathematics)|dual notion]] to that of the [[radical of a module]]. In set notation,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm {soc}(M) = \sum \{ N \mid N \text{ is a simple submodule of }M \}. &lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm {soc}(M) = \bigcap\{ E \mid E \text{ is an essential submodule of }M \}. &lt;/math&gt;

The '''socle of a ring''' ''R'' can refer to one of two sets in the ring. Considering ''R'' as a right ''R'' module, soc(''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined, and considering ''R'' as a left ''R'' module, soc(&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'') is defined. Both of these socles are [[ring ideal]]s, and it is known they are not necessarily equal.

* If ''M'' is an [[Artinian module]], soc(''M'') is itself an [[essential extension|essential submodule]] of ''M''.
* A module is [[semisimple module|semisimple]] if and only if soc(''M'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M''.  Rings for which soc(''M'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M'' for all ''M'' are precisely [[semisimple ring]]s.
* soc(soc(''M''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;soc(''M''). 
*M is a [[finitely cogenerated module]] if and only if soc(''M'') is finitely generated and soc(M) is an [[essential extension|essential submodule]] of M.
*Since the sum of semisimple modules is semisimple, the socle of a module could also be defined as the unique maximal semi-simple submodule.
* From the definition of rad(''R''), it is easy to see that rad(''R'') [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilates]] soc(''R''). If ''R'' is a finite-dimensional unital [[algebra]] and ''M'' a finitely generated ''R''-module then the socle consists precisely of the elements annihilated by the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Alperin]]; Rowen B. Bell, ''Groups and Representations'', 1995,  {{isbn|0-387-94526-1}}, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socle of a Lie algebra==
In the context of [[Lie algebra]]s, a '''socle of a [[symmetric Lie algebra]]''' is the [[eigenspace]] of its structural [[automorphism]] which corresponds to the eigenvalue&amp;nbsp;−1. (A symmetric Lie algebra decomposes into the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of its socle and [[cosocle]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Postnikov]], ''Geometry VI: Riemannian Geometry'', 2001,  {{isbn|3540411089}},[https://books.google.com/books?id=P60o2UKOaPcC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=cosocle#v=onepage&amp;q=socle&amp;f=false p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stratification''' has several usages in mathematics.

==In mathematical logic==
In [[mathematical logic]], '''stratification''' is any consistent assignment of numbers to [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] symbols guaranteeing that a unique formal [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of a logical theory exists. Specifically, we say that a set of [[Clause (logic)|clauses]] of the form &lt;math&gt;Q_1 \wedge \dots \wedge Q_n \wedge \neg Q_{n+1} \wedge \dots \wedge \neg Q_{n+m} \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; is stratified if and only if
there is a stratification assignment S that fulfills the following conditions:

# If a predicate P is positively derived from a predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs positively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than or equal to the stratification number of Q, in short &lt;math&gt;S(P) \geq S(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.
# If a predicate P is derived from a negated predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs negatively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than the stratification number of Q, in short &lt;math&gt;S(P) &gt; S(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

The notion of stratified negation leads to a very effective operational semantics for stratified programs in terms of the stratified least fixpoint, that is obtained by iteratively applying the fixpoint operator to each ''stratum'' of the program, from the lowest one up.
Stratification is not only useful for guaranteeing unique interpretation of [[Horn clause]]
theories. It has also been used by [[W.V. Quine]] (1937) to address [[Russell's paradox]], which undermined [[Frege]]'s central work ''[[Grundgesetze der Arithmetik]]'' (1902).

==In set theory==
In [[New Foundations]] (NF) and related set theories, a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the language of first-order logic with equality and membership is said to be
'''stratified''' if and only if there is a function
&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; which sends each variable appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (considered as an item of syntax) to
a natural number (this works equally well if all integers are used) in such a way that
any atomic formula &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)+1 = \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt; and any [[atomic formula]] &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) = \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

It turns out that it is sufficient to require that these conditions be satisfied only when
both variables in an atomic formula are bound in the set abstract &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt;
under consideration.  A set abstract satisfying this weaker condition is said to be
'''weakly stratified'''.

The stratification of [[New Foundations]] generalizes readily to languages with more
predicates and with term constructions.  Each primitive predicate needs to have specified
required displacements between values of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at its (bound) arguments
in a (weakly) stratified formula.  In a language with term constructions, terms themselves
need to be assigned values under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, with fixed displacements from the
values of each of their (bound) arguments in a (weakly) stratified formula.  Defined term
constructions are neatly handled by (possibly merely implicitly) using the theory
of descriptions:  a term &lt;math&gt;(\iota x.\phi)&lt;/math&gt; (the x such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) must
be assigned the same value under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as the variable x.

A formula is stratified if and only if it is possible to assign types to all variables appearing
in the formula in such a way that it will make sense in a version TST of the theory of
types described in the [[New Foundations]] article, and this is probably the best way
to understand the stratification of [[New Foundations]] in practice.

The notion of stratification can be extended to the [[lambda calculus]]; this is found
in papers of Randall Holmes.

==In topology==
In [[singularity theory]], there is a different meaning, of a decomposition of a [[topological space]] ''X'' into disjoint subsets each of which is a [[topological manifold]] (so that in particular a  ''stratification'' defines a  [[partition of a set|partition]] of the topological space). This is not a useful notion when unrestricted; but when the various '''strata''' are defined by some recognisable set of conditions (for example being [[locally closed]]), and fit together manageably, this idea is often applied in geometry. [[Hassler Whitney]] and [[René Thom]] first defined formal conditions for stratification.  See [[Whitney stratification]] and [[topologically stratified space]].

==In statistics==
See [[stratified sampling]].

'''String art''', or '''pin and thread art''', is characterized by an arrangement of colored thread strung between points to form  [[geometric pattern]]s or representational designs such as a ship's [[sail]]s, sometimes with other artist material comprising the remainder of the work. Thread, wire, or string is wound around a grid of nails hammered into a [[velvet]]-covered wooden board. Though straight lines are formed by the string, the slightly different angles and metric positions at which strings intersect gives the appearance of [[Bézier curve]]s (as in the mathematical concept of [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of a family of straight lines). [[Bézier curve#Quadratic curves|Quadratic Bézier curve]] are obtained from strings based on two intersecting segments. Other forms of string art include [[Spirelli]], which is used for [[cardmaking]] and [[scrapbooking]], and curve stitching, in which string is stitched through holes.

String art has its origins in the 'curve stitch' activities invented by [[Mary Everest Boole]] at the end of the 19th century to make mathematical ideas more accessible to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Mary Everest Boole: An Erstwhile Pedagogist for Contemporary Times|title=Vita mathematica|editor1-last=Calinger|editor1-first=Ronald|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-88385-097-4|last=Michalowicz|first=Karen Dee Ann|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularised as a decorative craft in the late 1960s through kits and books.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:Hanakapiai Beach Warning Sign Only.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Counting using tally marks at [[Hanakapiai Beach]]. The number shown is 82.]]
[[Image:Indian numerals 100AD.svg|frame|[[Brahmi numeral]]s (lower row) in India in the 1st century CE. Note the similarity of the first three numerals to the [[Chinese characters]] for one through three (一 二 三), plus the resemblance of both sets of numerals to horizontal tally marks.]]

'''Tally marks''', also called '''hash marks''', are a [[unary numeral system]]. They are a form of [[numeral system|numeral]] used for [[counting]]. They are most useful in [[counting]] or tallying ongoing results, such as the [[score (game)|score]] in a game or sport, as no intermediate results need to be erased or discarded.

However, because of the length of large numbers, tallies are not commonly used for static text. Notched sticks, known as [[tally stick]]s, were also historically used for this purpose.

==Early history==
{{main|Prehistoric numerals}}
Counting aids other than body parts appear in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. The oldest [[tally stick]]s date to between 35,000 and 25,000 years ago, in the form of notched bones found in the context of the [[European Stone Age|European]] [[Aurignacian]] to [[Gravettian]] and in Africa's [[Late Stone Age]].

The so-called ''[[Wolf bone]]'' is a prehistoric artifact discovered in 1937 in [[Czechoslovakia]] during excavations at [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Vestonice]], [[Moravia]], led by [[Karel Absolon|Karl Absolon]]. Dated to the [[Aurignacian]], approximately 30,000 years ago, the bone is marked with 55 marks which may be [[tally mark]]s. The head of an ivory [[Venus figurine]] was excavated close to the bone.&lt;ref&gt;*Graham Flegg, ''Numbers: their history and meaning'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-486-42165-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ishango bone]], found in the [[Ishango]] region of the present-day [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], is dated to over 20,000 years old. Upon discovery, it was thought to portray a series of [[prime number]]s. In the book ''How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years'', Peter Rudman argues that the development of the concept of prime numbers could only have come about after the concept of division, which he dates to after [[10,000 BC]], with prime numbers probably not being understood until about 500 BC. He also writes that "no attempt has been made to explain why a tally of something should exhibit multiples of two, [[prime numbers]] between 10 and 20, and some numbers that are almost multiples of 10."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-59102-477-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Marshack]] examined the Ishango bone microscopically, and concluded that it may represent a six-month [[lunar calendar]].&lt;ref name=Marshack&gt;Marshack, Alexander (1991): ''The Roots of Civilization'', Colonial Hill, Mount Kisco, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clustering==
[[File:Unary8.svg|thumb|upright|150px|Various ways to cluster the number 8. The first or fifth mark in each group may be written at an angle to the others for easier distinction. In the fourth example, the fifth stroke "closes out" a group of five, forming a "herringbone". In the fifth row (used in [[Brazil]], [[France]], and the [[United States]]) the fifth mark crosses diagonally, forming a "five-bar gate".]]

Tally marks are typically clustered in groups of five for legibility. The cluster size 5 has the advantages of (a) easy conversion into decimal for higher arithmetic operations and (b) avoiding error, as humans can far more easily correctly identify a cluster of 5 than one of 10.

==Writing systems==
[[Roman numerals]], the [[Chinese numerals]] for one through three (一 二 三), and [[counting rods|rod numerals]] were derived from tally marks, as possibly was the [[ogham]] script.&lt;ref&gt;Macalister, R. A. S.,  ''Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum'' Vol. I and II, Dublin: Stationery Office (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Base 1]] arithmetic [[notation system]] is an [[unary  system|unary]] [[positional system]] similar to tally marks. It is rarely used as a practical base for [[counting]] due to its difficult readability. It is made by the concatenation of [[zero]].

The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... would be represented in this system as&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=33|title=Programming Structures: Machines and programs|volume=1|series=Programming Structures|first=Jan|last=Hext|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1990|isbn=9780724809400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:0, 00, 000, 0000, 00000, ...

Base 1 notation is widely used in [[flour#Type numbers|type numbers]] of flour, the higher number represents a higher grind.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3007">'''Δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''' ('''Delta P''') is a mathematical term used to illustrate a change (Δ) in pressure (&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Uses==
*[[Young–Laplace equation]]

===Darcy–Weisbach equation===
As used in the '''[[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]''' — Given that the [[head loss]] ''h&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' expresses the [[pressure]] loss ''&amp;Delta;p'' as the height of a column of fluid,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \rho \cdot g \cdot h_f&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the density of the fluid, the Darcy–Weisbach equation can also be written in terms of pressure loss:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho V^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Lung compliance===
In general, compliance is defined by the change in volume ([[ΔV]]) versus the associated change in pressure (ΔP), or [[ΔV/ΔP]]. During [[mechanical ventilation]], compliance can be influenced by 3 key physiologic factors:
#[[Lung compliance]]
#[[Chest wall compliance]]
#[[Airway resistance]]

Lung compliance is influenced by a variety of primary abnormalities of [[lung parenchyma]], both chronic and acute. [[Airway resistance]] is typically increased by [[bronchospasm]] and airway secretions. Chest wall compliance can be decreased by fixed abnormalities (e.g. [[kyphoscoliosis]], [[morbid obesity]]) or more variable problems driven by patient agitation while intubated.&lt;ref name="pmid21866369"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dellamonica J, Lerolle N, Sargentini C, Beduneau G, Di Marco F, Mercat A, etal | title=PEEP-induced changes in lung volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Two methods to estimate alveolar recruitment. | journal=Intensive Care Med | year= 2011 | volume=  37| issue=  10| pages=  1595–604| pmid=21866369 | doi=10.1007/s00134-011-2333-y | pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating Compliance on [[minute volume]] (V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;: [[ΔV]] is always defined by [[tidal volume]] (V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), but ΔP is different for the measurement of dynamic vs. static compliance.

====Dynamic Compliance (C&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt;)====
:&lt;math&gt;C_{dyn} = \frac{V_T}\mathrm{PIP-PEEP}&lt;/math&gt;

where PIP = [[peak inspiratory pressure]] (the maximum pressure during inspiration), and PEEP = [[positive end expiratory pressure]]. Alterations in airway resistance, [[lung compliance]] and chest wall compliance influence C&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Static Compliance (C&lt;sub&gt;stat&lt;/sub&gt;)====
:&lt;math&gt;C_{stat} = \frac{{V_T}}{{P_{plat}-PEEP}}&lt;/math&gt;
where P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; = plateau pressure. P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; is measured at the end of inhalation and prior to exhalation using an inspiratory hold maneuver. During this maneuver, airflow is transiently (~0.5 sec) discontinued, which eliminates the effects of airway resistance. P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; is never &gt; PIP and is typically &lt; 3-5 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O lower than PIP when airway resistance is normal.
