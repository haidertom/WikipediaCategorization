The '''adelecti''' were also those persons under the [[Roman Empire|empire]] who were admitted to the privileges and honours of the [[praetor]]ship, [[quaestor]]ship, [[aedile]]ship, and other public offices, without having any duties to perform (''Historia Augusta'', "Helvius Pertinax", 6).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5643">{{Forms of government}}
'''Bankocracy''' (from the English word [[bank]] and [[Ancient Greek]] κράτος - ''kratos'', "power, rule") or '''trapezocracy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2011/03/02/the-road-to-bankruptocracy-how-events-since-2009-have-led-to-a-new-mode-of-reproduction/ |title=The Road to Bankruptocracy: How events since 2009 have led to a new mode of reproduction |author=[[Yanis Varoufakis]] |date= 2 March  2011|work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek τράπεζα -  ''trapeza'', "bank") is a polemic term referring to the excessive power or influence of [[bank]]s on [[public policy]]-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain is ruled by the banks, for the banks |author=Chakrabortty, Aditya |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/12/britain-ruled-by-banks |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 12 December 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to a [[form of government]] where [[financial institution]]s rule society.

==Usage==
One of the first uses of the term was by British Member of Parliament [[William Fullarton]] (1754–1808), who in a parliamentary debate on April 10, 1797 characterized the monopoly of the [[Bank of England]] as being a more important issue to solve than the peace attempts to end the [[Campaigns of 1797 in the French Revolutionary Wars|war against France]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/fullarton-william-1754-1808 FULLARTON,  William (1754-1808), of Fullarton, Ayr. | History of Parliament Online]&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|It is Bankocracy that threatens the destruction of social order ... that turns and overturns all questions respecting war, negotiations, and peace.}}

United States Senator [[Robert J. Walker]] (1801–1869), a staunch opponent of the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], delivered a speech in the [[US Senate|Senate]] on January 21, 1840, where he warned that the acceptance of [[Banknote|paper money]] as legal tender would "overthrow the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], subvert the liberties of the country, and the rights of the people, and establish the reign of a bankocracy, more sordid, ruinous, and despotic, than that of any monarch, however absolute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Speech of Mr. Walker, of Mississippi, on the bill to provide for the collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public money: Senate U.S. January 21, 1840. 
|last1=Walker|first1= Robert J.|authorlink=Robert J. Walker |year=1840 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=13|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/wu.89095783668 |accessdate=September 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] used the term in his work ''Les Confessions d’un révolutionnaire'' (1849), in reference to the [[July Monarchy]]:&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Confessions_of_a_Revolutionary/5 Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1849). Confessions of a Revolutionary V. 1830-1848: Government Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The principle of the July government, founded by and for the middle class, was therefore property, the capital. Under a monarchical form, the essence of that government was ''bankocracy''.}}

The term was also used by [[Karl Marx]] in his work ''[[Das Kapital|Das Kapital, Kritik der politischen Ökonomie]]'' (1867). He theorizes the birth of [[national debt]] as the catalyst for the [[primitive accumulation of capital]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm Marx, Karl (1867). Capital, Vol. I. Chapter Thirty-One: Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist]&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|The public debt becomes one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation. ... [T]he national debt has given rise to joint-stock companies, to dealings in negotiable effects of all kinds, and to agiotage, in a word to stock-exchange gambling and the modern bankocracy.}}

In [[Marxian economics]], the term cognates with [[finance capitalism]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophical Terms vol. II - English-German / Englisch-Deutsch
|last1=Waibl |first1=Elmar|last2=Herdina|first2=Philip|authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher= Walter de Gruyter|location= |isbn=3110979497 |page= 345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7OiXFVasZEC&amp;dq=bankokratie&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=September 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous political observers and journalists have used the term when describing or commenting on the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lanchester |first1=John  |last2= |first2= |year=2009 |title= Bankocracy |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |volume=31 |issue= 21|pages= 35–36|publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n21/john-lanchester/bankocracy |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Leicester]] - '[http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/events/2010-2019/2012/feb/npevent.2012-01-25.0792876682 Against Bankocracy: Bank ownership, regulation and growth]' event&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/2011/01/12/citizens-must-fight-rise-of-european-bankocracy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114215911/http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/2011/01/12/citizens-must-fight-rise-of-european-bankocracy |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-14 |title=Citizens must fight rise of European bankocracy |author=[[David McWilliams (economics pundit)|David McWilliams]] |date=12 January  2011 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bash Back!''' was a network of radical, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[queer]] projects within the United States. Formed in [[Chicago]] in 2007 to facilitate a convergence of radical trans and gay activists from around the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Radical Transfolk and Queers Converge In Chicago April 5th | url= http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/01/208992.shtml | last= Bash Back Chicago! | accessdate= 2008-10-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726180029/http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/01/208992.shtml | archive-date= 2011-07-26 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bash Back! sought to critique the ideology of the mainstream [[LGBT]] movement, which the group saw as [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into the dominant institutions of a [[heteronormative]] society. Bash Back! was noticeably influenced by the [[anarchist]] movement and radical queer groups, such as [[ACT UP]] and [[Gay Shame]], and took inspiration from the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] and San Francisco's [[White Night riots]].&lt;ref name="bashbacknews.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web | title= About BB! News | url= http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/about/ | accessdate= 2008-10-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081224084953/http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/about/ | archive-date= 2008-12-24 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, [[Bash Back#Chapters|other chapters]] had formed and had carried out various [[direct action]]s across the US. In July 2011, after a ruling involving the 2008 incident at Mount Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan, Andy Field, former Bash Back president for the Lansing chapter stated, "There is no Bash Back! anymore," due to "internal politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Balaskovitz |first=Andy |url=http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-6100-bash-back_-resolved.html |title=Bash Back! resolved |publisher=Lansingcitypulse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Points of unity"==
According to their website, anyone could form a Bash Back! chapter as long as they adhered to the basic points of unity:
# Fight for liberation. Nothing more, nothing less. State recognition in the form of oppressive institutions such as marriage and militarism are not steps toward liberation but rather towards heteronormative assimilation.
# A rejection of [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]], and all forms of state power.
# Actively oppose oppression both in and out of the "movement." No oppressive behavior is to be tolerated.
# Respect a diversity of tactics in the struggle for liberation. Also, do not solely condemn an action on the grounds that the state deems it to be illegal.

==Actions==

===First collective action===
The first Bash Back! Convergence was held in April 2008{{clarify|date=July 2011}}. The goal of the convergence was to form ideas for the then-upcoming protests at the DNC and the RNC, and discuss the formation of new Bash Back! chapters in other regions of the country. As a result, groups in [[Milwaukee]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Denver]], [[Lansing]], and [[upstate New York]] sprung up as new chapters.

Together, members of the newly formed Bash Back! groups took to the streets of Chicago's [[Boystown, Chicago|Boystown]] neighborhood in protest of assimilationist politics, trans-exclusion in the gay community, and recent police assaults on trans and queer people. The unpermitted march was eventually dispersed when a crowd surrounded the Chicago Police's Addison/Halsted headquarters, reading aloud statistics of trans and queer people killed by police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back! Marches in Chicago | url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=18024 | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2008 [[Milwaukee Pridefest]]===
[[Image:Milkwaukeenaziconfrontation.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bash Back! Milwaukee Displaying Banner at Milwaukee Pridefest]]
In June 2008, the [[neo-Nazi]] organization the [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]], released a statement that announced its intention to demonstrate at Milwaukee's annual [[PrideFest (Milwaukee)|Pridefest]] as a statement that the Nazis do not support "the promotion of homosexuality in [their] community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Milwaukee Summerfest | url=http://www.nsm88.org/activities/milwaukee%20summerfest.html | website=National Socialist Movement | accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neo Nazis, Riot Gear, and the Pink Bloc |url=http://altdash.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=74 |first=Tea |last=Krulos |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803142501/http://www.altdash.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=74 |archivedate=August 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of more than twenty confronted members of the NSM, carrying a banner proclaiming "These Faggots Kill Fascists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Pictures From Milwaukee Pridefest | url= http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/06/209763.shtml | first= m. | last= boozie | accessdate= 2008-10-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080615011519/http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/06/209763.shtml | archive-date= 2008-06-15 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The action prompted Pridefest organizers to criticize Bash Back!. Members of Bash Back! Milwaukee in turn denounced the organizers as betraying the queer community, stating "They would rather see well protected neo-nazis than a well-defended queer and trans community. Nobody will protect us if not ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back! MKE Statement About Pridefest and Nazi Confrontation | url= http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/06/209779.shtml | first=  | accessdate= 2008-10-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080616143144/http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/06/209779.shtml | archive-date= 2008-06-16 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July 2008 Chicago Pride events===
Bash Back! Chicago carried out a number of actions during their city's Pride Weekend in 2008. The first was participation in the annual [[Chicago Dyke March]] in Chicago's [[Lower West Side, Chicago|Pilsen]] neighborhood. Bash Back!'s contingent in the march focused on resistance to [[gentrification]] in the Pilsen community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Dyke March: Different neighborhood, same message | url= http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=18803 | first=Yasmin | last=Nair | accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a large lead banner stating "Bash Back Against Gentrification!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back Pride Pt.1: The Dyke March! | url= http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/83058/index.php | first= | accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, members of Bash Back! also took part in Chicago's larger [[Chicago Pride Parade]]. Bash Back! Chicago wheeled a cage through the parade containing a member dressed as Chicago's [[Mayor Richard M. Daley]], whom the group believes is responsible for cutting AIDS funding, turning a blind eye to police torture and brutality, and supporting gentrification. Simultaneously, members of Bash Back! also distributed barf bags with slogans written on them such as "Corporate Pride Makes Me Sick," a statement about the commercial and assimilative intentions of mainstream gay culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back! makes point at parade | url= http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=18827 | first=Yasmin | last=Nair | accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Memphis Pride Festival===
In 2008, [[Mid-South Pride]], organizers of the [[Memphis Pride Festival]], announced that the 2008 festival would be co-anchored by Nike and called the move an "expansion opportunity for the GLBT citizens of the city". Outraged, Bash Back! Memphis wheatpasted fliers along Cooper Street{{clarify|date=July 2011}} the night before the march condemning Nike's sweatshop practices and mainstream gay culture. The following day{{When|date=May 2010}}, as the Memphis Pride march proceeded under the [[Cooper-Young, Memphis|Cooper-Young]] railroad trestle, several BB! members dropped a banner reading "Queer Liberation, not Queer Consumerism".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===August 2008 [[Democratic National Convention]]===
At the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], Bash Back! Denver organized a protest of a fundraiser for the [[Human Rights Campaign]], a gay rights lobby group. Bash Back! Denver criticized the HRC for its policies of trans exclusion in the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]], as well as the HRC's support for corporate interests and the [[Iraq War]]. The action ended in the detention of four activists at the scene and the arrest of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DNC: 4 Detained, 1 Arrested @ Bash Back!

Bash Back! also organized a "trans and queer bloc" as part of the larger [[black bloc]] of the Anti-Capitalista Day of Action. The event ended in the detention of most participants, and several bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Video of the Anti-Capitalista march, and subsequent arrests. | url= http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/08/26/18530099.php | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, Bash Back! continued to counter-protest, especially against conservatives holding signs reading things like "homo-sex is a sin" by having a queer kiss-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DNC Protests: Day Three | url= http://rogueimc.org/en/2008/08/13816.shtml | accessdate= 2008-10-18 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615235123/http://rogueimc.org/en/2008/08/13816.shtml | archive-date= 2011-06-15 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2008 [[Republican National Convention]]===
At the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], members of various Bash Back! groups from around the country participated in a road blockade as a part of [[Unconventional Action]]'s direct action strategy to disrupt the convention. BB seized an intersection in downtown St. Paul and blocked cars and delegate buses from passing by having a festive dance party. The blockade was eventually met with force by mounted police and the activists were forced to disperse. Soon afterwards, members of Bash Back! also confronted the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] when they appeared at the intersection where Bash Back! conducted its action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= "Act up, Bash Back!"

===October 2008 Annual Human Rights Campaign Dinner===
On October 4, 2008, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) held its annual dinner in Washington DC. Bash Back! DC confronted the organization once again for publicly not supporting a trans-inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act in the House of Representatives in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Ted Kennedy pushing non-trans inclusive ENDA | url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/TF_in_news/08_0411/stories/2_kennedy_noninclusive_enda.pdf |format=PDF| first=Andrew | last=Miga | accessdate=2008-11-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081113020015/http://www.thetaskforce.org/TF_in_news/08_0411/stories/2_kennedy_noninclusive_enda.pdf| archivedate= 13 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20 protestors gathered for a dance party at the front doors of the fundraiser with signs such as “HRC Is Not For Me” and “Stonewall Was a Riot”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back!

DC, stated that the reason for the protest was that "assimilation will not save us, it will only end in the decimation of our community. Society must change to accommodate us, queers and transfolk must refuse assimilation and cultural erasure at the hands of the homonormative gay elite and build a world where we can liberate ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back!

===November 2008 protest at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan===
On November 9, 2008, a contingent from Bash Back!'s [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] chapter picketed outside Mount Hope Church, because the church promoted traditional biblical strictures concerning homosexuality. Meanwhile, several Bash Back! members entered the building disguised in plain-clothes and disrupted a worship service. During the late morning service the group dropped a rainbow banner bearing the slogan "It's Okay to Be Gay! Bash Back!" from the sanctuary balcony and showered a thousand fliers exhorting teenagers in the congregation to "embrace and explore" their feelings, and assuring them there are many organizations supportive of gays that "enable you to be who you truly are."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081112/NEWS01/811120369 |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/bash-back-raises-hell-at-anti-queer-mega-church/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202184649/http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/bash-back-raises-hell-at-anti-queer-mega-church/ |date=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris, Nathan p. 6"&gt;Harris, Nathan.

According to ''Bash Back! News'', Mount Hope Church was targeted for its [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] belief that homosexuality is a sin, for its production of "[[hell house]]s" that demonize gays, and for its hosting of conferences of "ex-gays."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris, Nathan p. 6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20081120132957147 |title=Bash Back!

In May 2009, [[Alliance Defense Fund]] filed a federal lawsuit against Bash Back! on behalf of the church, under the [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20090515/NEWS01/905150322/1002/NEWS01 |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNamara |first=Neal |url=http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-3061-bash-back-retains-lawyer-in-protest-suit.html |title=Bash Back retains lawyer in protest suit |publisher=Lansingcitypulse.com |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those sued refused to name others who participated in the protest, so Mount Hope Church issued a subpoena to Riseup Networks in an attempt to obtain the names of email account holders who the church believed either participated in the action or knew who did. As part of a settlement, the activists agreed to a permanent injunction preventing them from disrupting any religious services in the US.  They also agreed to pay the church $2,750 in damages. The district court entered a default judgment against Bash Back! and Bash Back! Lansing, and closed the case.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2012/11/27/homophobic-church-persuades-appellate-court-to-overrule-protest-related-sanctions-award/ "Homophobic Church Persuades Appellate Court to Overrule Protest-Related Sanctions Award"], Activist Defense, November 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 "Avenge Duanna" Campaign===
In November 2008, to coincide with [[transgender]] day of remembrance, Bash Back! groups began staging actions in memory of [[Duanna Johnson]], a [[trans woman]] who was brutally beaten by Memphis police officers and murdered while in the process of suing the police department. Many within the Memphis queer community are convinced that the police had a hand in her murder. Bash Back! Philly shut down downtown Philadelphia in a [[reclaim the streets|reclaim-the-streets]] style action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back!

{{Populism sidebar}}
{{African American topics sidebar|right}}

Following the collapse of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[African American]]s created a broad-based independent political movement in the South: '''Black Populism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2008, pp. 74–100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==

Between 1886 and 1898 Black farmers, [[sharecropper]]s, and agrarian laborers organized their communities to combat the rising tide of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] laws. As Black Populism asserted itself and grew into a regional force, it met fierce resistance from the white planter and business elite that, through the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated network of courts, militias, sheriffs, and newspapers, maintained tight control of the region. Violence against Black Populism was organized through the [[Ku Klux Klan]], among other white terrorist organizations designed to halt or reverse the advance of black civil and political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2010, pp. 113–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

Despite opposition, Black Populists carried out a wide range of activities:

*Establishing farming exchanges
*Raising money for schools
*Publishing newspapers
*Lobbying for better legislation
*Mounting boycotts against agricultural trusts
*Carrying out strikes for better wages
*Protesting the convict-lease system and lynching
*Demanding Black jurors in cases involving black defendants
*Promoting local political reforms and federal supervision of elections
*Running independent and fusion campaigns.

Black Populism found early expression in various agrarian organizations, including the [[Colored Agricultural Wheels]], the southern [[Knights of Labor]], the [[Cooperative Workers of America]], and the [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union|Colored Farmers' Alliance]]. However, facing the limitations in attempting to implement their reforms absent of engaging the electoral process, Black Populists helped to launch the [[People's Party (United States)|People’s Party]] and used the then left-of-centre [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in fusion campaigns. (Today though, after the Republican Party moved to the right, and the Democratic Party in the South was abandoned by the White Populist [[Dixiecrats]] who had opposed integration in the 1960s, most African Americans who vote cast ballots for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidates).&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2010, pp. 13–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance and failure==

By the late 1890s, under relentless attack – propaganda campaigns warning of a “second Reconstruction” and “Negro rule,” physical intimidation, violence, and assassinations of leaders and foot soldiers – the movement was crushed. A key figure in the attack on Black Populism was [[Ben Tillman]], the leader of [[South Carolina]]'s white farmers' movement. As realistic politicians, the Southern Populist knew that they had only two possible alternatives in the fight against the ruling [[Bourbon Democrat]]s. They must choose between trying to win the Negro votes or working to eliminate it entirely. The Tillman group in South Carolina sought the latter method. They were completely reactionary on the Negro question and stood with the Bourbons in disregarding the principles of the Fifteenth Amendment. Elsewhere the populists sought to win Negro votes, either through fusion with the Republican minority or through the raising of issues with a broad appeal to the Negro farmers. It was no accident that in the South the third-party movement was strongest in those states where it sought not only black votes but active black support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rochester |first=Anna |year=1943 |title=The Populist Movement in the United States |location=New York |publisher=International Publishers |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that African Americans had somehow betrayed populism would haunt the Georgia People's Party from the very beginning. Populists had realized the political importance of blacks. Of the state's forty thousand Republicans voters, a considerable majority were former bondsmen. If the white votes were to split, they might decide the outcome of any state election. But therein lay a predicament. How were Populists to court the black votes without losing the whites? How were they to keep whites from supporting the "negro party"? An attempt had to be made to win over blacks. It was a risky scheme, but it contained a degree of precedent in state politics. In the 1870s and 1880s, democrats and independents had sometimes used the same device when the white votes splits. In those days many whites were willing to allow African American men the ballot, especially when it could be sometimes bought for so little.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Barton |first=C. Shaw |year=1947 |title=The Wool-Hat Boys – Georgia's Populist Party |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Black populism was destroyed, marking the end of organized political resistance to the return of [[white supremacy]] in the South in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, black populism stood as the largest independent political uprising in the South until the modern [[Civil Rights]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2005, pp. 6–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Blue Shirts Society''', also known as the '''Society of Practice of the Three Principles of the People''' ({{zh|三民主義力行社}}, commonly abbreviated as SPTPP), the '''Spirit Encouragement Society''' (勵志社, SES) and the '''China Reconstruction Society''' (中華復興社, CRS), was a secret [[fascist]] clique in the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party).

Although in its early stage the society's most important members came from the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], and constituted elements of the KMT's [[Whampoa Clique]], by the 1930s its influence extended into the military and political spheres, and had influence upon [[Economic history of China (1912-49)|China's economy]] and [[Chinese society|society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dc7NOiTSgM0C&amp;pg=PA165 |title=War and nationalism in China, 1925-1945|author=Hans J.

==Birth==
The Blue Shirts origins can be traced to the Whampoa Clique of 1924 - professional military officers - many of whom had sworn personal loyalty to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], as well to the ideals of [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Three Principles of the People]].

After the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] of 1927, Chiang and the KMT seized most of China's territories. The government established was in a degree of social crisis: there were tensions as Japan's conquest of [[Manchuria]]; Chiang had also formally split the [[First United Front]], the alliance between the KMT and the CCP ([[Communist Party of China]]), turning the two parties against each other. The CCP had bases in the cities and to a lesser degree in the countryside, posing a threat to Chiang's government. The KMT itself was not of one mind; divided into several cliques, there were power struggles between Chiang, [[Hu Hanmin]] and [[Wang Jingwei]]. China was still scourged by [[corruption]], [[poverty]], and infrequent [[civil war]].

Being the foundation of Chiang's rule, some Whampoa graduates felt it time to take action. Consequently, in July 1931, {{ill|Teng Jie|zh|滕傑}} (滕傑) and Xiao Zanyu (蕭贊育) were sent back to China to investigate the threat from Japan and any forthcoming war.

When Teng and Xiao returned to China, they were upset to find the KMT, in their eyes, "gravitating toward decadence". Teng designed a blueprint to reform the KMT, suggesting a single great and powerful leader could save China and the KMT. The leader could rule by all means, hopefully as a [[benevolent dictator]]. Chiang was a sound candidate, and over the following months Teng traveled around the capital of [[Nanjing]] seeking support from Whampoa fellows.

Teng was acquainted with Zeng Kuoqing (曾擴情), among the first graduates of Whampoa, and the man in charge of the Whampoa Alumni Association. Because the KMT banned organized political parties, Teng and Zeng searched for alumni in secret. Zeng used his influence and personal relations among Whampoa graduates to organize periodic meetings to discuss Teng's plan.

After several months the group included prominent Whampoa graduates, including He Zhonghan (賀衷寒), widely regarded as one of The Three Most Outstanding Whampoa graduates (the other two being CCP members Jiang Xianyun (蔣先雲) and Chen Geng (陳賡), the patriarch of the Sun Yat-sen Theory Research Group at that time); Hu Zongnan (胡宗南)，a rising young general in Chiang's National Revolutionary Army; Deng Wenyi (鄧文儀 )，another patriarch of the Sun Yat-sen Theory Research Group and a secretary to Chiang, and; Feng Ti (丰悌), the Commissar of the 1st Division of the KMT army.

In September 1931, in the third meeting of the group, an organization to reform the KMT and fight against Japan was decided. Under the direction of He Zhonghan, this group was named the Society of the Practice of [[Three Principles of People]] (三民主義力行社, SPTPP). Teng was elected [[General Secretary]]. The party also issued guidance on the establishment, discipline and organization of members, and confirmed its main mission as follows:
:1. use secret measures to fight against the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]], the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]], other KMT cliques, and ensure the Whampoa clique's domination of the KMT and China;
:2. use the public image of the Whampoa Alumni Association to enroll new members and set up a formal, well-organized and highly disciplined group.

Funds were mainly raised by Deng, who ran the KMT's Party Book Shop, a publishing house for party-political propaganda. Furthermore, to avoid arrest under the KMT's political organization ban, members decided not to tell Chiang Kai-shek of their plan, even while regarding him as their spiritual mentor and leader.

Before long Kang Ze (康澤), who published the ''China Daily'' newspaper with the permission of Chiang, became the mouthpiece of the SPTPP.

In December 1931, under pressure both inside and outside the KMT, Chiang resigned. While in retirement at his hometown in [[Zhejiang]], Chiang showed growing interest in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]]. Deng subsequently let Chiang know of the existence of the SPTPP. Chiang summoned He, Teng and Kang to a meeting, where he announced his idea for a more formal and disciplined organization like those in Italy and Germany. Thus specific rules and articles to guide the party were drafted.

With support from Chiang, Teng designed a hierarchical organization style. At the top was Chiang, with the foundations made from the elite of Whampoa graduates. New members could only be accepted with two recommendations and approval from Chiang himself. Members were not allowed to resign unless the group faced dissolution. If there was any violation of discipline, members would receive severe punishment.

In 1932 Chiang regained the presidency after a power struggle between his opponents. Hoping to speed reform of the SPTPP, in a secret meeting in February [[Gui Yongqing]] (桂永清)， a member of the SPTPP, recommended Liu Jianqun (劉健羣) as a suitable candidate. Liu, He Yingqin's (何應欽) secretary, contributed much to the group.

Liu wrote a pamphlet called ''Some Opinions On The Reform of the KMT''. In this, Liu proposed reform of the KMT be enforced via a group of elites established and organized along the lines of  Mussolini's [[Blackshirts|MVSN]] or Blackshirts. Members would wear blue shirts to pledge their allegiance. Accordingly, the leader should encourage by his sublime, superior spirit. Under the direction of the leader, all members would live simple and disciplined lives, and all cadres would be treated equally, with incomes and lives under strict supervision. Violation would be severely punished. In return, the people would entrust property and their families to the country and the supreme leader. Public responsibilities would depend on ability, from military service to absolute obedience of orders including surveillance of one's neighborhoods. Lives would be divided into stages, including a youth wing. Thus, China would be turned into a militarized society, with a three tier organization, highest to lowest: Supreme Leader - Blue Shirt Society - People.

Liu Jianqun ordered membership be kept a secret:

"With a view to attaining the object of immediately overthrowing the feudal influences, exterminating the Red Bandits, and dealing with foreign insult[s], members of the Blue Shirts Society should conduct in secret their activities in various provinces, xian, and cities, except for the central Guomindang headquarters and other political organs whose work must be executed in an official manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYYYQYK6FAYC&amp;pg=PA75 |title=Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese secret service|author=[[Frederic E. Wakeman]] |year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=|page=75|isbn=0-520-23407-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang met with Liu and appreciated his theory, leading to the evolution of the SPTPP into the Blue Shirt Society (BSS). In March 1932, under cover of an existing club called the Spirit Encouragement Society (勵志社)，the SPTPP officially announced its establishment. Although Liu's proposal that members wear blue shirts and name their society after the blue shirts was not accepted, the SPTPP was privately known as the BSS from then on. In its formal opening ceremony, Teng was elected General Secretary, with He, Kang as Standing Secretariat. The BSS consisted of six divisions: Secretariat, Organization, Propaganda, Military, Special Agency and Logistics. The secret society reached its peak, with the BSS infiltrating the country's political system, military and even the everyday lives of people.

==Rise and achievements==
During the early to mid-1930s Chiang was busy carrying out his suppression of the CCP's Red Army in the countryside. With his permission, the BSS took over the defense of [[Nanking]]. Most of the prominent Whampoa graduates now got promotions as commanders and became BSS members. Besides increasing its influence in the army, the BSS infiltrated the police and security services in major cities, and recruited members in the KMT youth league. The BSS now had influence in China's military, labor unions, publishing houses and schools. A new structure of power had emerged, with the BSS at the core of the Whampoa Clique, coexisting and competing against the two better known cliques: the [[CC Clique]], led by [[Chen Lifu]] (陳立夫) and [[Chen Guofu]] (陳果夫)，whose remit was dealing with party issues, and; the [[Politics Research Group]] (政學系) led by [[Yang Yongtai]] (楊永泰) and [[Zhang Qun]] (張群), whose remit was the day-to-day running of the KMT government.

Liu's pamphlet was accepted as the guideline of the BSS, and part of it was revised into the Regulation of Life Discipline. In accordance with this, BSS members would be paid low wages, with part being donated to the BSS. Gambling and opium were banned. Anti-corruption laws and laws prohibiting BSS members from having mistresses were to be strictly abided by. The practice of BSS members became quite distinct from the majority of KMT bureaucrats.

In June 1932, an anti-graft campaign was launched under the direction of BSS member, Deng Wenyi. A special force, mostly comprising BSS members, cracked down on corrupt police officers in [[Wuhan]]. After several arrests and executions, the police force was considered improved. Deng then waged war against organized crimes, prostitution, opium and gambling. After 3 months, Deng had won Chiang's praise. Chiang wanted this effort to be promoted around the country, and so launched a campaign to purify the capital. The results were less successful and derided as a failure.

Meanwhile, the BSS was playing an active role in suppressing the CCP. Zeng Kuoqing, using his status in the Whampoa Alumni Association, wrote a letter to Xu Jishen (許繼慎), commander of [[Zhang Guotao]]'s 4th Red Army and a Whampoa graduate, asking Xu to defect to the KMT. Xu did not reply, but when his superiors discovered the letter, suspicions were raised and the CCP decided to carry out a purge. Thousands of commanders and soldiers were tortured and executed, weakening the CCP's resistance. In light of this, in October 1932, Hu Zongnan led his army (mainly commanded by BSS officers) in a cruel and decisive battle against [[Xu Xiangqian]] in Hekou [[Anhui]]. In contrast to other KMT armies, the army had high-morale, was composed of hand-picked men, and equipped with the best weaponry. With strong support from other armies also led by BSS members such as Yu Jishi (俞濟時) and Huang Jie (黃杰), Xu's CCP army was routed. After suffering some 10,000 casualties, Zhang and Xu retreated. Hu and his troop chased, and when Zhang and his army reached [[Sichuan]] to set up another base, Hu remained in [[Gansu]] nearby. Hu, with his chosen men and strong army, became known as the King of Northwestern China.

Coinciding With the BSS's ever-increasing power and influence, disagreements within the BSS leadership mounted. Chiang, who regarded the BSS as a tool, would not allow them more power and influence. Teng could not accept this and conflicts between him and Chiang were frequent. In 1933, Chiang chose He Zhonghan to succeed Teng as General Secretary of the BSS.

As a more ambitious and skilled politician than Teng, He Zhonghan won a power struggle against his BSS rival Liu Jianqun. Subsequently, He decided to set up a propaganda network run by Kang Ze. This special agency under the direction of Dai Li, and his deputy Zheng Jiemin (鄭介民), evolved into a network infiltrating every corner of China. The BSS's influence grew into [[North China|Northern China]], which was under direct threat of invasion by Japan. In 1933 the Japanese army invaded Rehe, and KMT armies fought against them along the [[Great Wall]]. The BSS now changed from an elite secret society into an anti-Japanese mass movement. Liu was sent to the BSS's Northern China Division, which was called the China Reconstruction Society (中華復興社，CRS). Most members were university lecturers and student groups, and in the summer of that year the CRS had divisions in 24 provinces of China with more than 40,000 members. With the CRS controlling the political training system of the KMT, new recruits were always available. With thousands of members, political instructors and front organizations, the BSS had a kingdom under the direction of He.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Establishment of the CRS.jpg|right|frame|Ceremony of Establishment of the CRS, the first line from right to left: Deng, Du Xingru, Zeng, He and Gui]] --&gt;
Besides setting up the CRS, the BSS also played a part in the Second Stage Revolution. Using influence in Northern and Southwestern China to persuade local warlords to pledge allegiance to Chiang, a reform of the KMT armies was carried out. An air force and armored corps was set up, alongside wars against corruption, opium and poverty. Reconstruction of rural areas was undertaken, with roads built and bank loans provided to peasants. The most significant part of this movement was Kang Ze's New [[Jiangxi]] Style and Special Detachment (別動隊，NJSSD).

In 1933 during the [[5th Suppression Campaign]] against the CCP, Chiang decided to set up a paramilitary force. Kang was appointed to lead the NJSSD, the only direct military group in the BSS.  Soon the NJSSD had integrated of military, political, police, military police and secret police powers. At its peak it had 24,000 members and three divisions of regular troops. The NJSSD had peasants living near Soviet Jiangxi and Northern Anhui categorized and confined, where they had limited access to the outside world. A family hoping to prove itself non-CCP needed to have the guarantee of four other families, and promise not to collaborate with or provide support to the CCP. Violations would have the whole family executed, along with the families of the four guarantors. The NJSSD set up hundreds of concentration camps around Shangrao, Jiangxi, where they tortured and executed residents and CCP captives. Under this system, fewer and fewer peasants supported the CCP. Merchants who smuggled materiel to the CCP were also broken down, with peasants organized to build blockades against the Soviet Territory. With the shortage of supplies, accompanied by heavy attacks from the KMT, the CCP had to launch its now-famous [[Long March]] in order to retreat.

The NJSSD started the New Jiangxi Style plan in territories previously occupied by the Communists, providing compulsory education and free medical treatment to peasants. With a brutal but effective anti-corruption campaign, they provided loans, seeds and pesticides also. Nevertheless, the NJSSD engaged in fervent brutality, executions of perceived CCP sympathisers, and innocents. In one case, in Mount Dabie, previously the base of the 4th Red Army in Northern Anhui, more than half a million were massacred. At the same time, in accordance with NJSSD and New Jiangxi Style, Kang reached the peak of his career, and he raised enough finances to challenge He as leader of the BSS.

Xiao Zuolin (肖作霖), a BSS member early on, drafted a plan called the Whole New Culture Movement and proposed the establishment of an organization called the Chinese Culture Academy to increase the BSS's influence in culture. Xiao got Deng Wenyi's support and carried out his plan by taking over several newspapers and journals, and by enrolling its members in universities. Its scheme of forging a movement for a new culture was adopted by Chiang, and on 19 February 1934, he announced the [[New Life Movement]] at a meeting in [[Nanchang]]. The plan involved reconstructing the moral system of the Chinese and welcoming a renaissance and reconstruction of Chinese national pride.

In March, Chiang issued guidance, consisting of 95 rules of the New Life Movement, being a mixture of Chinese traditions and western standards. It was a vast propaganda movement, with war mobilization and military maneuvers on a scale that China had never experienced before. But because the plan was so ambitious and rigid, and because its policies created too much inconvenience in the everyday lives of the people, it fell into disfavor. Nearly three years later in 1936, Chiang had to accept that his favorite movement had failed. Deng, Kang and Jiang Xiaoxian (蔣孝先), Chiang's nephew and bodyguard, also BSS members were appointed General Secretariats of the New Life Movement, with supervision of public lifestyles enforced by BSS cadres. By controlling the mouthpieces of the KMT, the BSS openly expressed advocacy of fascism in its publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmIJNq5dUp8C&amp;pg=PA77 |title=A place in the sun: Marxism and Fascism in China's long revolution|author=Anthony James Gregor|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|location=|page=77|isbn=0-8133-3782-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall==
Unlike Teng, He was a professional politician, and never concealed his ambition for power. After fostering a Hunan Clique in the BSS, Chiang became concerned the BSS might threaten his governance. In 1934 he accused the BSS of corruption and malfunction, dismissing He as General Secretary. Liu Jianqun was appointed as successor. With NJSSD and the Southwestern Clique behind him, and the Zhejiang Clique led by Hu Zongnan and Dai Li opposing him, Liu Jianqun's BSS faced the same fragmented fate as the KMT it had helped get rid of.

With the New Culture Movement failed but still officially ongoing, the BSS spread its influence into the cultural centers of [[Shanghai]] and other major cities that used to be the [[CC Clique]]'s power base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |title=Government and politics in Kuomintang China, 1927-1937|author=Hung-mao Tien|year=1972|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=|page=63|isbn=0-8133-3782-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1934, the Nanchang Airport, built by donations from international Chinese, and designed to train the KMT air force, was burned down. The Aviation Commissioner, Xu Peigen (徐培根), who was also a BSS member, was the primary suspect. Deng was sent to investigate this case. He reached the conclusion that the fire was accidentally caused by a cigarette dropped by a soldier, but Chen Lifu and Yang Yongtai argued Xu masterminded the fire to eliminate evidence of corruption, and Deng had colluded to cover it up. Xu was kept in custody, Deng was sacked, and his titles were removed. The Chinese Culture Academy was banned. Dai Li was sent to take over Deng's investigation agency and quietly integrated it into his own special agency, which later evolved into the Military Statistical Bureau, the notorious secret police of the KMT. Dai no longer played any major part in the BSS now he had set up his own kingdom.

Taking advantage of this blow to the BSS's prestige, the Politics Research Clique consummated the Administrative Office System, adding new levels of administration between provinces and counties (the two tier system of provinces and counties had been used in China for more than a thousand years). With the appearance of new offices, the Politics Research Clique was able to control the county level. Many bureaucrats who used to be loyal to the CC Clique and the BSS defected to the suddenly more powerful Politics Research Clique. The Politics Research Clique took over the security forces, the police and the militia step by step. Liu, whose failures in the BSS were an embarrassment, was replaced by Feng Ti under the excuse that he had health problems. He was sent to Manchuria to work with Zeng Kuoqing.

In 1935, two editors of a pro-Japanese newspapers were assassinated in Manchuria. The Japanese thought these actions were taken by the BSS and argued it was a violation of the [[Tanggu Truce|Tanggu Accord]] signed to keep the status quo between the Japanese and China. [[Yoshijirō Umezu]] (梅津美治郎), commander of the [[Japanese China Garrison Army]] and [[Kenji Doihara]]'s (土肥原賢二) Japanese intelligence agency investigated and presented a memo to [[He Yingqing]]. Agreeing with the Japanese recommendations in this memo, all Chinese forces heavily influenced by the BSS (including military police, regular forces such as the 2nd Division and the 25th Division) should be evacuated from [[Beijing]] and out of [[Hebei]] province.

Taking over military training for the KMT, Feng Ti enrolled new members into the BSS. Hu Zongnan, Dai Li and other former BSS members also strengthened their grip on power by enrolling members into their own private armies. At the top were hundreds of Whampoa graduates, aided by some 30,000 mid- and low-level officers, university teachers and public servants. Below them were more than 200,000 members of the CRS. At the bottom were hundreds of thousands of boy scouts. With the organization undergoing such rapid expansion, corruption and inefficiency plagued the BSS across the country. Furthermore, in 1935, there was a serious security leak in its headquarters after the BSS tried to assassinate [[Wang Jingwei]], Chiang's presidential rival. Under heavy pressure, Feng Ti was sacked. Liu Jianquan took over, to be replaced in turn by Zheng Jiemin.

In 1936 Deng Wenyi became General Secretary of the BSS, just in time for December's [[Xi'an Incident]]. Chiang was kidnapped and held by General [[Zhang Xueliang]], who favored fighting the Japanese more than the CCP. There were disagreements between KMT leaders on whether to solve the kidnapping by peace talks or military action. In BSS meeting, He Zhonghan and Deng were determined to use force and called for the mobilization of BSS members around the country. 176 young generals issued a statement to denounce Zhang Xueliang and declare war on his army. Under He's direction, more than 2000 officers and BSS members held a meeting pledging their allegiance to Chiang and agreeing to mobilize against the Young Marshall. Gui Yongqing led an army of more than 12,000 men in armored vehicles across the [[Yangtze River]] towards where Chiang was being held, while a few [[bombers]] were launched by overzealous military and BSS officers. Chen and other KMT leaders refused to support this, however, and even He Yingqing, who was in charge of the KMT military, did not agree with the BSS's movement. No official support was given by the KMT.

Chiang's wife [[Soong Mei-ling]] came to Xian for peace talks. Due to the efforts of the CCP delegation, led by [[Zhou Enlai]], who wanted to set up an alliance with the KMT against the Japanese, Chiang was released several weeks later. After his release, Chiang took revenge on the BSS's reckless action and lack of control. Deng was sacked, with all titles removed again, and he was replaced by Kang Ze. He Zhonghan was out of favor with Chiang and forced to travel around Europe in exile. In March 1937, Chiang issued his order that all BSS activities be temporarily suspended.

With the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] breaking out on 7 July 1937, Japanese troops seized vast areas of China. Before Nanjing fell, Kang led the retreat of the BSS from its headquarters. In 1938 the BSS held its first and last national congress in Wuhan. Here, members of the BSS and SPTPP were permitted to have their memberships automatically transferred to the KMT, members of the CRS could be transferred to the Youth League of Three Principles of the People (三民主義青年團, YLTPP). Most of the 500,000 members of the BSS and CRS refused to transfer to the KMT, instead choosing the YLTPP, which became the basis of a new force within the KMT. Hu Zongnan kept the position of Director of the YLTPP, while Kang acted as his agent. The biggest winner was Dai Li: his new spy agency, the Military Statistical Bureau was formed, and he transferred all the intelligence agents of the BSS, CRS and NJSSD into it, giving him one of the largest intelligence services in the world. He kept control over this secret empire until his death in an airplane crash in 1946.

The BSS had been officially dismissed, but Kang wished to keep it alive under the cover of the YLTPP. In the following 7 years he increased YLTPP membership from 400,000 to more than 1.5 million, and used NJSSD techniques to re-organize the YLTPP. The result was a group more efficient and disciplined than the KMT, which aroused Chiang's suspicion again. After returning from the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek's son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] sought to take over the YLTPP. Kang was reluctant and tried to resist these efforts, sealing his fate. In 1945 Kang was sent to Europe and Chiang Ching-kuo was given the YLTPP's seat. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], members of the YLTPP suffered the same fate as the KMT. Only prominent YLTPP figures such as Kang survived CCP purges, as examples of clemency toward war criminals.

==Legacy==
The following were some of the most prominent and earliest members of BSS.

Teng was later appointed as mayor of Nanjing. He went to Taiwan in 1945 with KMT troops and later retired from the position of chairman of Central Trust Bureau of the KMT. After years of retirement, he was appointed director of Labor Bureau. In 1949, when the KMT retreated to Taiwan, he was Minister of Communication and Policy Counsellor.

Liu's wife was an agent working for [[Kenji Doihara]], bringing many confidential documents with her on defecting to the Japanese. After this, Liu himself was forced to become a fugitive to escape Dai Li's secret police. After becoming a monk and spending years in [[Guizhou]], Chiang's men found him by chance. Chiang showed leniency by offering Liu a position as vice-speaker of the KMT Congress. When he went to Taiwan, Liu lived in poverty, and before his death in 1960s his last contribution was to provide valuable details for an article on the BSS written by an American professor.

Having risen and fallen several times, Deng showed little interest in politics after the Sino-Japanese War. He arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and retired as Director of the Political Work Bureau.

Feng Ti was appointed as commander of guard for [[Changsha]], but was executed in 1938 after KMT forces engaged in a [[scorched earth policy]] to resist the invasion of Japanese army. The resultant fires killed thousands of civilians

Kang returned from Europe during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and was sent to the battlefront. Captured and made a [[POW]], KMT propaganda depicted him as a martyr. In reality, Kang lived well in custody and defected to the CCP. In 1963 he was released in a CCP amnesty and died 4 years later.

Hu's troops were annihilated by CCP armies during the Civil War. When he left for Taiwan in 1949, he was impeached by 46 members of the KMT's [[Control Yuan]] for incompetence in military command. Although Hu was released with no charge, he was appointed a defense commander for a little island and never returned to central politics. After retiring, he died in 1962.

Zeng was captured and made a POW in the Civil War. Later released by the CCP, he died in 1983.

Gui was made commander of the KMT navy during the Civil War, then went to Taiwan. He died during his term as Chief of Staff of the KMT Army in 1954.

Dai Li became head of secret police and espionage of the KMT, and died in an air crash in 1946. His assistant, Zheng, succeeded Dai in running the KMT secret police. He died in 1959 in Taiwan.

'''Civil registration''' is the system by which a [[government]] records the [[vital event]]s (births, marriages, and deaths) of its [[citizen]]s and [[Residency (domicile)|resident]]s. The resulting repository or [[database]] has different names in different countries and even in different US states. It can be called a '''civil registry''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/topics/civil_registry.asp|title=OAS - Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development|first=|last=OAS|date=1 August 2009|website=Oas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''civil register''' (but this is also an official term for an individual file of a vital event),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=341|title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms - Civil register Definition|first=OECD Statistics|last=Directorate|website=stats.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''vital records''', and other terms, and the office responsible for receiving the registrations can be called a '''bureau of vital statistics''', '''registry of vital records and statistics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm|title=Where to Write for Vital Records - Homepage|date=30 June 2018|website=Cdc.gov|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''registrar''', '''registry''', '''register''', '''registry office''' (officially '''register office'''), or '''population registry'''. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create a legal [[document]] that can be used to establish and protect the [[civil rights|rights]] of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]]. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was [[France]] in 1539, using the registers of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Sweden]] followed in 1631, on the basis of a register drawn up by the [[Church of Sweden]] on behalf of the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish king]].

The [[United Nations]] defines civil registration as "the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population as provided through [[decree]] or [[regulation]] in accordance with the legal requirements of a country. Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the legal documents required by law. These records are also a main source of vital statistics. Complete coverage, accuracy and timeliness of civil registration are essential to ensure the quality of vital statistics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/UNSD/demographic/sources/civilreg/default.htm|title=United Nations Statistics Division: Civil registration systems|website=Unstats.un.org|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vital events that are typically recorded on the register include live [[birth]], [[death]], [[stillbirth|foetal death]], [[name]], [[change of name]], [[marriage]], [[divorce]], [[annulment of marriage]], [[legal separation|judicial separation of marriage]], [[adoption]], [[legitimation|legitimization]] and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_84E.pdf|format=PDF|title=United Nations Handbook on Training in Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems |website=Unstats.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the legal documents that are derived from civil registration are [[birth certificate]]s, [[death certificate]]s, and [[marriage certificate]]s. A [[family register]] is a type of civil register which is more concerned with events within the [[family]] unit and is common in Continental European and Asian countries, such as Germany (''{{lang|de|[[Familienbuch]]}}''), France, Spain, Russia (''[[Resident registration in Russia|Propiska]]''), China (''[[Hukou system|Hukou]]''), Japan (''[[Koseki]]''), and [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] (''[[Hoju]]'').

Additionally, in some countries, [[immigration]], [[emigration]], and any change of [[residency (domicile)|residence]] may require notification. A [[resident registration|register of residents]] is a type of civil register primarily concerned with the current residence.

== Challenges ==
Civil registration is faced with many challenges, both on the demand side and supply side, especially in the low income countries. The demand-side challenges include a lack of awareness of the need and importance of registration of vital events, and the situation is not helped by the many existing barriers to registration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=World|last2=Organization|first2=World Health|date=2014-05-28|title=Global Civil Registration and Vital Statistics : A Scaling Up Investment Plan 2015-2024|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10986/18962|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2009, the World Health Statistics of WHO estimated that only about 1% of the estimated deaths within low income groups are reported and just about 9% in lower-middle income groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The registration systems in many cases are very difficult, causing potential barriers to accessing the registration. Furthermore, in certain societies, due to stigmatisation based on cultural and religious settings, single mothers may fear questions of paternity during notification through chief or community agents.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P|first=Kathuri, Bernard|date=2016|title=Birth Notification Service For Civil Registration In Kenya – SOA Model|url=http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/100245|website=Erepository.uonbi.ac.ke|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the supply side, challenges often involve different, and often conflicting, legal frameworks various stakeholders (health institution, civil registry, statistics agency), and as a result, many countries with "burdensome procedures and non-standardized systems across a country, leading to confusion regarding what individuals need to do or present."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other challenges include  accessibility of remote areas and also irregular migration caused by civil conflicts and porous borders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Innovations ==
There has been new developments in civil registration across the globe over the years. With the advent of enhanced and information and communication technology, civil registration has been moving from a paper-intensive, manual-based civil registration to more automated and digitalised systems. Some of the innovations implemented in civil registration include the use of e-birth notification systems, whereby the health officials are able to notify the national population registration system with new births.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/namibia/media_20171.html|title=UNICEF Namibia - Media centre - Innovative e-Birth Notification System Launched in Namibia|website=Unicef.org|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system improve registration process, by timely feeding the system with information as soon as a birth occurs. Another innovation, such as that implemented by [[Icivil|iCivil Africa]] in [[Burkina Faso]], is the use of a mobile application to register newborns .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biometricupdate.com/201608/icivil-promises-much-needed-birth-registration-in-africa|title=iCivil promises much needed birth registration in Africa|date=2016-08-09|work=BiometricUpdate|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
=== Namibia ===
In [[Namibia]], Civil registration mandate lies with the government through the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration, which has offices in all fourteen region of the country. Although some vital events (e.g., marriages) are recorded by various agencies (e.g., church and courts), vital records are contained in the National Population Register, which is maintained by the department of Civil Registration within the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mha.gov.na/web/mhai/civil-registration-services|title=Department of Civil Registration - GRN Portal|website=Mha.gov.na|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Namibia, civil registration and identity management systems are integrated and managed by one department. Over the years, Namibia has transformed its civil registration processes, moving away from the manual system to electronic system. In 2017, Namibia, which has at least 22 birth and registration offices based within the maternity wards of hospitals across the country, launched its e-birth notification system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This improvement is expected to "improve the quality of vital statistics produced in the country.  The system is also a welcome departure from the present mechanism of relying on surveys for estimations of birth registration rates and projections of the numbers of births each year."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, vital records are contained in the National Population Register, which is maintained by the national [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]]. Any Home Affairs office can record a vital event or issue a certified copy of a vital record.

=== Burkina Faso ===
In Burkina Faso, since 2015, a centralized [[CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistic)|CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics)]] is being implemented by the non governmental organization iCivil Africa. This "new tech start up has set themselves a massive task: to register all newborn babies digitally".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/01/africa/birth-registration-system-burkina-faso/index.html|title=New technology could help 230 million 'ghost' children|last=Morlin-Yron|first=Sophie|date=|website=cnn.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==
=== France ===
France was the first country to create a national Registration. In 1539, King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] ordered in the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]], as part of a wider legislation regarding the policing of [[Benefice|church benefice]]s, to keep vital records registers in the various church local institutions (mainly [[parish]]es). The ordinance orderer the creation of at least a register of [[baptism]]s, as a proof of one's date of birth, and a register of [[burial]]s of churchmen, as a proof of one's date of death. Though both registers were kept by religious authorities, they were authenticated by a public notary, always a layman, and were kept in the local royal administration's archives. In fact, as the church kept [[parish register]]s since the Middle Ages (the oldest one in France is [[Giry]]'s, of 1303), these registers were used to meet the ordinance's dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;Delsalle, Paul (2009). Histoires de familles: les registres paroissiaux et d'état civil, du Moyen Âge à nos jours : démographie et généalogie. Besançon: Presses universitaires de Franche-Comté. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The national registration was fully laicized in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]] by order of the French Republic. These records have been continued through the present and are kept at the departmental archives. The Civil Registration includes birth, marriage, divorce, and death records.

=== Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]], maintaining the civil registry ("basisregistratie personen") is the duty of the municipalities.

Before the [[History of the Netherlands#Revolution.2C Republic and French rule|French Rule]], the Netherlands did not have a central registration of its population, which was introduced in some parts of the country in 1796 by the French. In 1811, this registration was introduced throughout the country. The Dutch differentiate between the ''basisregistratie personen'', an ongoing database of citizens' information, and the ''burgerlijke stand'', which is a collection (at the municipal level) of documents evidencing certain events taking place in a given municipality, such as birth, marriage, [[civil union]], and death.&lt;ref name=seegers/&gt;

Beginning on 1 January 1850, municipalities were obliged to keep citizen's records in book form (Dutch: bevolkingsregister). Early in the twentieth century this system was replaced by a card system that registered families. The move toward individual registration took place in 1939 with the introduction of the ''persoonskaart'', a single card registering a single individual, kept in the municipality. Information gathered on this card included family name, first names, gender, position within the family, date and place of birth, marital status, address, and church affiliation, besides information on when a person entered and left a municipality.&lt;ref name=seegers/&gt;

In 1940, the Dutch government did not want to mandate citizen's identification, but during [[World War II]] the German occupying government mandated it so they could assess who was to be sent to Germany as forced labor and to select Jewish citizens from the general population. When the war was over, mandatory identification was done away with.&lt;ref name=seegers&gt;{{cite book|last=Seegers|first=G.H.J.|title=Persoonlijk gegeven - Grepen uit de geschiedenis van bevolkingsregistratie in Nederland|year=1993|publisher=Bekking|location=Amersfoort|author2=M.C.C. Wens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s all local registries were automated, and starting on 1 October 1994 the individual registration card was replaced with a digital list containing a person's information as collected by the ''gemeentelijke basisadministratie van persoonsgegevens'' (in 2015 replaced with the 'basisregistratie personen'), kept and maintained at the municipal level. Municipalities exchange information through a closed network at the end of each day to a nationwide database, which can be consulted by officials online. Though it was generally considered "un-Dutch," on 1 January 2005 mandatory identification (when asked by a mandated person) was reintroduced for everyone over 14; official identification is to be presented for all important transactions between citizens and government.

=== Romania ===
Civil registries were introduced in 1806-1812 during the Russian occupation, and they followed the Tsarist model of keeping them with church records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/registrele-parohiale-stare-civila-introduse-principatul-moldovei-tara-r|title=Registrele parohiale de stare civilă, introduse în Principatul Moldovei şi Ţara Românească în timpul războiului ruso-turc (1806-1812)|website=Historia.ro|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the "Communal Law" (''Legea comunală'') of 31 March 1864 subsequent record keeping became the responsibility of the mayor in each dwelling, who was allowed to delegate it to one of his helpers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdQwAQAAIAAJ|title=Din istoria statisticii româneşti: culegere de articole|first=Romania Direcția Centrală de|last=Statistică|date=12 July 1969|publisher=Direcţia Centrală de Statistică|accessdate=12 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; An effort by the state to gather the ancient historical records happened around 1926-1932 but in some cases as late as 1948-1952; a good number of these early records were lost in this process, sometimes literally by the truckload.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arhivelenationale.ro/images/custom/image/serban/RA%201%202008/05_bodale,_arcadie.pdf Colecţia de stare civilă – între realizări şi deziderate] by [[Romanian National Archives]] (pp. 55-56)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, the civil registry is maintained by the [[Swedish Tax Agency]] (''Skatteverket''); up into the 1990s the [[Church of Sweden]] was responsible. Recording of births and deaths was stipulated in the early 17th century, formal national [[census]]es have been made since the mid-18th century, and Sweden has one of the longest and most comprehensive suites of civil records of any country.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], civil registration was first introduced with the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836]] which affected England and Wales. The [[General Register Office for England and Wales]] was set up and the civil registration of [[birth]]s, [[marriage]]s, and [[death]]s in [[England and Wales]] was became mandatory on 1 July 1837.&lt;ref name="Herber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herber|first=Mark D. |title=Ancestral trails: the complete guide to British genealogy and family history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFhmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=March 1998|publisher=Genealogical Pub. Co., Inc|isbn=978-0-8063-1541-6|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the onus lay on registrars to discover and record events, so parents only had to supply information if and when asked.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt; In 1875, the Births &amp; Deaths Act 1874 came into force, whereby those present at a birth or death were required to report the event.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt; Subsequent legislation introduced similar systems in [[Ireland]] (all of which was then part of the United Kingdom) on 1 April 1845 for Protestant marriages and on 1 January 1864 for all birth, marriage and death events.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt; Civil registration was introduced in [[Scotland]] on 1 January 1855.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt;

The administration of individual [[registration district]]s is the responsibility of ''registrars'' in the relevant [[local authority]].  There is also a national body for each [[jurisdiction]].  The local offices are generally responsible both for maintaining the original registers and for providing copies to the national body for central retention.  A ''superintendent registrar'' facilitates the legal preliminaries to marriage, conducts civil marriage ceremonies and retains in his/her custody all completed birth, death and marriage registers for the district. The office of the [[superintendent registrar]] is the district [[register office]], often referred to (informally) in the media as the "registry office".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/registry-office registry office] Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary. Accessed August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, both officers may also conduct statutory civil partnership preliminaries and ceremonies, citizenship ceremonies and other non statutory ceremonies such as naming or renewal of vows. Certified copies of the entries made by the registrars over the years are issued on a daily basis either for genealogical research or for modern legal purposes such as supporting passport applications or ensuring eligibility for the appropriate junior sports leagues.

On 1 December 2007 registrars and superintendent registrars became employees of their local authority for the first time following the enactment of the [[Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007]].

==== England and Wales ====
Births in England and Wales must be registered within 42 days, whilst deaths must be registered within 5 days unless an inquest is called or a post mortem is held.

Marriages are registered at the time of the ceremony by either
# the officiating [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church in Wales]],
# an authorised person at a [[registered building]], religious,  or 
# a registrar at a [[register office]], [[registered building]] or [[approved premise]].

The official registers are not directly accessible by the general public. Instead, indexes are made available which can be used to find the relevant register entry and then request a certified copy of the details.

The [[General Register Office]]—now merged into the [[Office for National Statistics]]—has overall responsibility for registration administration.

==== Scotland ====
Civil registration came into force in [[Scotland]] on 1 January 1855.  A significant difference from the English system is the greater detail required for a registration.  This means that if a certified copy of an entry is requested, it will contain much more information.

The [[General Register Office for Scotland]] has overall responsibility for registration administration and drafting legislative changes in this area (as well as census data).  They are governed by the [[Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965]] and subsequent legislation (responsibility for which has now been devolved to the [[Scottish Parliament]]).

== North America ==
=== Mexico ===
In [[Mexico]], vital records (birth, death and marriage certificates) are registered in Registro Civil, as called in Spanish. Each state has its own registration form. Until the 1960s, birth certificates were written by hand, in a styled-cursive [[calligraphy]] (almost unreadable for the new generations) and typically issued on security paper. After the 1960s, they were issued typed by machine.

Currently all copies (from people born before and after the 1960s) are standardized in brown-security paper and are typed automatically by a computer and the [[CURP]], (control identification number in Mexico) and the specific dates of issuing are already issued.

=== United States ===
In the United States, [[vital records]] such as [[birth certificates]], [[death certificates]], and frequently [[marriage certificate]]s are maintained by the Office of Vital Statistics or Office of Vital Records in each individual state. Other documents such as [[deed]]s, [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] documents, [[name change]] documents, and [[divorce|divorce records]], as well as marriage certificates for those states not centralizing these records,  are maintained by the [[Clerk of Court]] of each individual [[County (United States)|county]]. However, the term 'civil registry' is not used.

== Asia ==
=== Philippines===
In the Philippines, civil registrations are maintained by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/civilregistration|title=Civil Registration|publisher=[[Philippine Statistics Authority]]|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]] civil registrations are carried out and maintained by state administrations. [[Tasmania]] began registrations in 1838, [[Western Australia]] in 1841,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU |WA|num_act|bdamr45vn9439|Births, deaths and marriages registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdm.dotag.wa.gov.au/I/indexes_history.aspx |accessdate=23 September 2017 |title=Indexes History |date=15 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Australia]] in 1842, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1853,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access.prov.vic.gov.au/public/component/daPublicBaseContainer?component=daViewFunction&amp;breadcrumbPath=Home/Access+the+Collection/Browse+The+Collection/Function+Details&amp;entityId=39|title=Access the Collection - Public Record Office Victoria (PROV)|first=corporateName: Public Record Office|last=Victoria|website=Access.prov.vic.gov.au|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.qld.gov.au/justice-services/births-deaths-and-marriages Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages - Queensland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122022723/http://www.justice.qld.gov.au/justice-services/births-deaths-and-marriages |date=2011-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Territory]] in 1870, and [[Australian Capital Territory]] in 1911. Prior to those dates, records of baptisms, marriages and burials were kept by individual churches. Because early civil registration often involved the churches, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish whether early records are civil or church records. Civil registration was carried out by government employees independent of the churches. The information recorded in records varies from state to state. South Australia calls the appropriate central registry the Principal Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages and in Victoria it is the Government Statist Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The other states call the registry the Office of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages.

'''Classical liberalism''' is a [[political ideology]] and a [[History of liberalism|branch]] of [[liberalism]] which advocates [[civil liberties]] under the [[rule of law]] with an emphasis on [[economic freedom]]. Closely related to [[economic liberalism]], it developed in the early 19th century, building on ideas from the previous century as a response to [[urbanization]] and to the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].{{sfn|Conway|p=296}}&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite book|first = Richard |last =Hudelson |date = 1999|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Modern%20Political%20Philosophy&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title= Modern Political Philosophy|pages =  37–38|isbn =9780765600219|publisher = M.E. Sharpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=129}} Notable individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"&gt;Steven M. Dworetz (1994). ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. It drew on the [[Classical economics|classical economic ideas]] espoused by [[Adam Smith]] in Book One of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and on a belief in [[natural law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Joyce Appleby|first = Joyce|last = Appleby|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=83HlqTJjLcgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date = 1992|title = Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination|page = 58|publisher =Harvard University Press|isbn = 9780674530133}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[utilitarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Gerald F.|last1= Gaus |author2-link= Chandran Kukathas|first2 = Chandran|last2= Kukathas|date = 2004|title = Handbook of Political Theory |page = 422|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dXjXKlb79cgC&amp;pg=PA422#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = SAGE|isbn =  9780761967873}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social progress|progress]].{{sfn|Hunt|p=54}} The term "classical liberalism" was applied in retrospect to distinguish earlier 19th-century liberalism from the newer [[social liberalism]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=52}}

== Evolution of core beliefs ==
Core beliefs of classical liberals included new ideas—which departed from both the older [[Conservatism|conservative]] idea of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|society as a family]] and from the later [[Sociology|sociological]] concept of society as [[Gesellschaft#Gesellschaft|complex set]] of [[social network]]s. Classical liberals believe that individuals are "egoistic, coldly calculating, essentially inert and atomistic"{{sfn|Hunt|p=44}} and that society is no more than the sum of its individual members.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=44–46}}

Classical liberals agreed with [[Thomas Hobbes]] that government had been created by individuals to protect themselves from each other and that the purpose of government should be to minimize conflict between individuals that would otherwise arise in a [[state of nature]]. These beliefs were complemented by a belief that laborers could be best motivated by financial incentive. This belief led to the passage of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], which limited the provision of social assistance, based on the idea that [[Market (economics)|markets]] are the mechanism that most efficiently leads to wealth. Adopting [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]'s population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, they believed population growth would outstrip food production and they regarded that consequence desirable because starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=49–51}}

Drawing on ideas of [[Adam Smith]], classical liberals believed that it is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea of the [[welfare state]] as interfering in a [[free market]].&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Alan Ryan, "Liberalism", in ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', ed. Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1995), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Smith’s resolute recognition of the importance and value of labor and of laborers, they selectively criticized labour's [[group rights]] being pursued at the expense of [[individual rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M. ed. (2001): ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'', London: Routledge, 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; while accepting [[Economic liberalism|corporations' rights]], which led to [[inequality of bargaining power]].{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=132}}&lt;ref name = smith&gt;{{cite book|last =Smith|first = A. |date = 1778|title =  An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|volume = I|chapter = 8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lgx2t0b3Xu&amp;sig=ygsWFIUuw8JhsxYeiXgaiE5LdNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGFIUfzqNe-N4gTvqoDgDA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22&amp;f=false|publisher = W. Strahan; and T. Cadell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical liberals argued that individuals should be free to obtain work from the highest-paying employers while the [[profit motive]] would ensure that products that people desired were produced at prices they would pay. In a free market, both labor and capital would receive the greatest possible reward while production would be organized efficiently to meet consumer demand.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=46–47}}

Classical liberals argued for what they called a minimal state, limited to the following functions:
* A government to protect individual rights and to provide services that cannot be provided in a free market.
* A common national defense to provide protection against foreign invaders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}
* Laws to provide protection for citizens from wrongs committed against them by other citizens, which included protection of private property, enforcement of contracts and common law.
* Building and maintaining public institutions.
* Public works that included a stable currency, standard weights and measures and building and upkeep of roads, canals, harbors, railways, communications and postal services.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}

They asserted that rights are of a [[Negative and positive rights|negative]] nature, which require other individuals (and governments) to refrain from interfering with the free market, opposing social liberals who assert that individuals have positive rights, such as the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to health care and the right to a living wage. For society to guarantee positive rights, it requires taxation over and above the minimum needed to enforce negative rights.&lt;ref name=Cato_Institut_Kelley&gt;[[David Kelley|Kelly, D.]] (1998): ''A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State'', Washington, DC: [[Cato Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|pp=36–38}}

Core beliefs of classical liberals did not necessarily include [[democracy]] or government by a majority vote by citizens because "there is nothing in the bare idea of majority rule to show that majorities will always respect the rights of property or maintain rule of law".&lt;ref name="RyanA_1995"&gt;Ryan, A. (1995): "Liberalism", In: Goodin, R. E. and Pettit, P., eds.: ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[James Madison]] argued for a constitutional republic with protections for individual liberty over a [[pure democracy]], reasoning that in a pure democracy a "common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole...and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party".&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, [[Federalist No. 10]] (22 November 1787), in Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison, ''The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States'', ed. Henry Cabot Lodge (New York, 1888), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XcllKruLvi4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;vq=%22common+passion+or+interest%22 p. 56].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, classical liberalism developed into [[neo-classical liberalism]], which argued for government to be as small as possible to allow the exercise of [[individual freedom]]. In its most extreme form, neo-classical liberalism advocated [[Social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name="mayne"&gt;Mayne, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right-libertarianism]] is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.&lt;ref name="mayne"/&gt;

=== Friedrich Hayek's typology of beliefs ===
[[Friedrich Hayek]] identified two different traditions within classical liberalism: the "British tradition" and the "French tradition". Hayek saw the British philosophers [[Bernard Mandeville]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Josiah Tucker]] and [[William Paley]] as representative of a tradition that articulated beliefs in [[empiricism]], the [[common law]] and in traditions and institutions which had spontaneously evolved but were imperfectly understood. The French tradition included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the [[Encyclopédistes|Encyclopedists]] and the [[Physiocrats]]. This tradition believed in rationalism and sometimes showed hostility to tradition and religion. Hayek conceded that the national labels did not exactly correspond to those belonging to each tradition: Hayek saw the Frenchmen [[Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] as belonging to the "British tradition" and the British [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Thomas Paine]] as belonging to the "French tradition".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|first = F. A. |last = Hayek|title = The Constitution of Liberty|location = London|publisher =  Routledge |date= 1976|pages =  55–56|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0otEBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Constitution+of+Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_a-MwpreAhUQXKwKHaLkCBMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn = 9781317857808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, 'Individualism: True and False', in ''Individualism and Economic Order'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek also rejected the label ''[[laissez-faire]]'' as originating from the French tradition and alien to the beliefs of Hume and Smith.

[[Guido De Ruggiero]] also identified differences between "Montesquieu and Rousseau, the English and the democratic types of liberalism"{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=71}} and argued that there was a "profound contrast between the two Liberal systems".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} He claimed that the spirit of "authentic English Liberalism" had "built up its work piece by piece without ever destroying what had once been built, but basing upon it every new departure". This liberalism had  "insensibly adapted ancient institutions to modern needs" and "instinctively recoiled from all abstract proclamations of principles and rights".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} Ruggiero claimed that this liberalism was challenged by what he called the "new Liberalism of France" that was characterised by egalitarianism and a "rationalistic consciousness".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|pp=81–82}}

In 1848, [[Francis Lieber]] distinguished between what he called "Anglican and Gallican Liberty". Lieber asserted that "independence in the highest degree, compatible with safety and broad national guarantees of liberty, is the great aim of Anglican liberty, and self-reliance is the chief source from which it draws its strength".{{sfn|Lieber|p=377}} On the other hand, Gallican liberty "is sought in government...the French look for the highest degree of political civilization in organizational, that is, in the highest degree of interference by public power".{{sfn|Lieber|pp=382–383}}

== History ==
=== Great Britain ===
Classical liberalism in Britain developed from [[Whigs (British political party)|Whiggery]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], was also heavily influenced by French [[physiocracy]] and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was associated with the defence of the British Parliament, upholding the rule of law and defending [[landed property]]. The origins of rights were seen as being in an [[ancient constitution]], which had existed from [[time immemorial]]. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by [[natural rights]]. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege rather than as a right. However, there was no consistency in Whig ideology and diverse writers including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]] were all influential among Whigs, although none of them was universally accepted.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}}

From the 1790s to the 1820s, British radicals concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasising natural rights and popular sovereignty. [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] adapted the language of Locke to the ideology of radicalism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}} The radicals saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael J. |last=Turner |year=1999 |title=British Politics in an Age of Reform |location=Manchester, England |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-51869 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was greater unity to classical liberalism ideology than there had been with Whiggery. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. They believed that required a free economy with minimal government interference. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers. Some elements of Whiggery opposed this new thinking and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature of classical liberalism. These elements became associated with conservatism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=29–30}}

[[File:1846 - Anti-Corn Law League Meeting.jpg|thumb|250px|A meeting of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in [[Exeter Hall]] in 1846]]
Classical liberalism was the dominant political theory in Britain from the early 19th century until the First World War. Its notable victories were the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829]], the [[Reform Act of 1832]] and the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure. Their policies of low public expenditure and low taxation were adopted by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] when he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Classical liberalism was often associated with religious dissent and [[nonconformism]].{{sfn|Gray|pp=26–27}}

Although classical liberals aspired to a minimum of state activity, they accepted the principle of [[government intervention]] in the economy from the early 19th century with passage of the [[Factory Acts]]. From around 1840 to 1860, ''laissez-faire'' advocates of the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] and writers in ''[[The Economist]]'' were confident that their early victories would lead to a period of expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace, but would face reversals as government intervention and activity continued to expand from the 1850s. [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of ''laissez-faire'', non-intervention in foreign affairs and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[utilitarianism]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] rejected classical liberalism altogether and advocated [[Tory democracy]]. By the 1870s, [[Herbert Spencer]] and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against them.{{sfn|Gray|p=28}} By the First World War, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had largely abandoned classical liberal principles.{{sfn|Gray|p=32}}

The changing economic and social conditions of the 19th century led to a division between neo-classical and social (or welfare) liberals, who while agreeing on the importance of individual liberty differed on the role of the state.  Neo-classical liberals, who called themselves "true liberals", saw Locke's ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise]]'' as the best guide and emphasised "limited government" while social liberals supported government regulation and the welfare state. Herbert Spencer in Britain and [[William Graham Sumner]] were the leading neo-classical liberal theorists of the 19th century.{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=596}} Neo-classical liberalism has continued into the contemporary era, with writers such as [[John Rawls]].{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=603}} The evolution from classical to social/welfare liberalism is for example reflected in Britain in the evolution of the thought of [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;See the studies of Keynes by [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], [[Donald Moggridge]] and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, liberalism took a strong root because it had little opposition to its ideals, whereas in Europe liberalism was opposed by many reactionary or feudal interests such as the nobility, the aristocracy, the landed gentry, the established church and the aristocratic army officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Louis|last= Hartz|title=The Liberal Tradition in America|date=1955|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=e1bQY1CDx2IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter = The Concept of a Liberal Society|isbn = 9780156512695|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] adopted many of the ideals of liberalism, but in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] changed Locke's "life, liberty and property" to the more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]".&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"/&gt; As the United States grew, industry became a larger and larger part of American life; and during the term of its first [[Populism|populist]] [[President of the United States|President]], [[Andrew Jackson]], economic questions came to the forefront. The economic ideas of the [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian era]] were almost universally the ideas of classical liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy M. Brown|title=Explaining the Reagan Years in Central America: A World System Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9N1duU9zgMC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-9813-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom was maximised when the government took a "hands off" attitude toward the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kahan|title=The Homestead Strike: Labor, Violence, and American Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctaTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=3 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-17397-4|page=28|quote=Called the "Jacksonian Era," this era was characterized by greater voting rights for white men, a hands-off approach to economic issues, and a desire to spread U.S. culture and government west (an outlook called "[[Manifest Destiny]]").}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues:
:[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen G.

Leading magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' espoused liberalism every week starting in 1865 under the influential editor [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin|Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] (1831–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Gustav |last = Pollak|url = https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofamer00poll |title= Fifty Years of American Idealism: 1865-1915|date = 1915|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of classical liberalism remained essentially unchallenged until a series of [[Depression (economics)|depressions]], thought to be impossible according to the tenets of [[classical economics]], led to economic hardship from which the voters demanded relief. In the words of [[William Jennings Bryan]], "[[Cross of Gold speech|You shall not crucify the American farmer on a cross of gold]]". Classical liberalism remained the orthodox belief among American businessmen until the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Voegelin&gt;Eric Voegelin, Mary Algozin, and Keith Algozin, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1406338 "Liberalism and Its History"], ''Review of Politics'' 36, no. 4 (1974): 504–520.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a sea change in liberalism, with priority shifting from the producers to consumers. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] represented the dominance of [[modern liberalism]] in politics for decades. In the words of [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]]:&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schelesinger Jr., [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"], in ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When the growing complexity of industrial conditions required increasing government intervention in order to assure more equal opportunities, the liberal tradition, faithful to the goal rather than to the dogma, altered its view of the state.

[[Alan Wolfe]] summarizes the viewpoint that there is a continuous liberal understanding that includes both [[Adam Smith]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Alan|last = Wolfe|url = http://www.tnr.com/blog/alan-wolfe/false-distinction |title = A False Distinction |work = The New Republic|date = 12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The idea that liberalism comes in two forms assumes that the most fundamental question facing mankind is how much government intervenes into the economy...

It represents adherence to the bourgeois organization of society epitomized by that much-maligned word, "Victorian": with its faith in individualism, capitalism, progress, and virtue. Having been silenced by the seemingly endless march of "embedded liberalism" since the New Deal, American conservatism has, since the late 1960s, regrouped, and under Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush created a new powerful political movement. Thus, apart from the brief period of Margaret Thatcher's ascendancy in Britain, it is only in the United States that the classical liberal tradition continues to have political force.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual sources ==
=== John Locke ===
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|160px|[[John Locke]]]]
Central to classical liberal ideology was their interpretation of [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'', which had been written as a defence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although these writings were considered too radical at the time for Britain's new rulers, they later came to be cited by Whigs, radicals and supporters of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Dworetz, ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of later liberal thought was absent in Locke's writings or scarcely mentioned and his writings have been subject to various interpretations. For example, there is little mention of [[constitutionalism]], the [[separation of powers]] and [[limited government]].{{sfn|Richardson|pp=22–23}}

James L. Richardson identified five central themes in Locke's writing: [[individualism]], consent, the concepts of the [[rule of law]] and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.{{sfn|Richardson|p=23}}

As a trustee, government was expected to serve the interests of the people, not the rulers; and rulers were expected to follow the laws enacted by legislatures. Locke also held that the main purpose of men uniting into commonwealths and governments was for the preservation of their property. Despite the ambiguity of Locke's definition of property, which limited property to "as much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of", this principle held great appeal to individuals possessed of great wealth.{{sfn|Richardson|pp=23–24}}

Locke held that the individual had the right to follow his own religious beliefs and that the state should not impose a religion against [[Dissenter]]s, but there were limitations. No tolerance should be shown for [[Atheism|atheists]], who were seen as amoral, or to [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], who were seen as owing allegiance to the Pope over their own national government.{{sfn|Richardson|p=24}}

=== Adam Smith ===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Adam Smith]]]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in 1848.{{sfn|Mills|pp=63, 68}} Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow to maximise wealth.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

Smith wrote that as long as supply, demand, prices and competition were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the public good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

He assumed that workers could be paid wages as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=65}} His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.{{sfn|Mills|p=66}} He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions.{{sfn|Mills|p=67}} Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income.{{sfn|Mills|p=68}}

Smith's economics was carried into practice in the nineteenth century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}}

=== Classical economics ===
In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]' theories of population and [[David Ricardo]]'s [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of [[classical economics]]. The pessimistic nature of these theories provided a basis for criticism of capitalism by its opponents and helped perpetuate the tradition of calling economics the "[[dismal science]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] was a French economist who introduced Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and Britain.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}} Say challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was Say's law, which was interpreted by classical economists that there could be no overproduction in a market and that there would always be a balance between supply and demand.{{sfn|Mills|p=70}} This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the economic cycle was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.{{sfn|Mills|p=71}}

Malthus wrote two books, ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (published in 1798) and ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]]'' (published in 1820). The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists.{{sfn|Mills|pp=71–72}} However, his first book became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.{{sfn|Mills|p=72}}

Ricardo, who was an admirer of Smith, covered many of the same topics, but while Smith drew conclusions from broadly empirical observations he used deduction, drawing conclusions by reasoning from basic assumptions {{sfn|Mills|pp=73–74}} While Ricardo accepted Smith's [[labour theory of value]], he acknowledged that utility could influence the price of some rare items. Rents on agricultural land were seen as the production that was surplus to the subsistence required by the tenants. Wages were seen as the amount required for workers' subsistence and to maintain current population levels.{{sfn|Mills|pp=74–75}} According to his iron law of wages, wages could never rise beyond subsistence levels. Ricardo explained profits as a return on capital, which itself was the product of labour, but a conclusion many drew from his theory was that profit was a surplus appropriated by [[Capitalism|capitalists]] to which they were not entitled.{{sfn|Mills|p=75}}

=== Utilitarianism ===
[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s later writings on the subject foreshadowed the [[welfare state]], it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.{{sfn|Richardson|p=32}}

The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that public policy should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

== Political economy ==
Classical liberals saw utility as the foundation for public policies. This broke both with conservative "[[Traditionalist conservatism|tradition]]" and [[Natural rights#John Locke|Lockean "natural rights"]], which were seen as irrational. Utility, which emphasises the happiness of individuals, became the central ethical value of all liberalism.{{sfn|Richardson|p=31}} Although utilitarianism inspired wide-ranging reforms, it became primarily a justification for ''laissez-faire'' economics. However, classical liberals rejected Smith's belief that the "invisible hand" would lead to general benefits and embraced Malthus' view that population expansion would prevent any general benefit and Ricardo's view of the inevitability of class conflict. ''Laissez-faire'' was seen as the only possible economic approach and any government intervention was seen as useless and harmful. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] was defended on "scientific or economic principles" while the authors of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601]] were seen as not having had the benefit of reading Malthus.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

However, commitment to ''laissez-faire'' was not uniform and some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]] as Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by [[Richard Cobden]] and the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}} The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''The Economist'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}}

''The Economist'' also campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. A rigid belief in ''laissez-faire'' guided the government response in 1846–1849 to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. The minister responsible for economic and financial affairs, [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Charles Wood]], expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}} The [[Corn Laws]] were finally repealed in 1846 by the removal of tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high,&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; but it came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy. ''A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland''. Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1074-9}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee. ''Aspects of British Political History, 1815–1914''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-415-09006-3}}. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free trade and world peace ==
Several liberals, including Smith and Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations could lead to [[world peace]]. Erik Gartzke states: "Scholars like Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Richard Cobden, [[Norman Angell]], and [[Richard Rosecrance]] have long speculated that [[free market]]s have the potential to free states from the looming prospect of recurrent warfare".&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; American political scientists John R. Oneal and Bruce M. Russett, well known for their work on the democratic peace theory, state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J. R.|first2=B. M.|title=The Classical Liberals Were Right: Democracy, Interdependence, and Conflict, 1950–1985|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=2|pages=267–294|year=1997|last1=Oneal|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00042|last2=Russet}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The classical liberals advocated policies to increase liberty and prosperity. They sought to empower the commercial class politically and to abolish royal charters, monopolies, and the protectionist policies of mercantilism so as to encourage entrepreneurship and increase productive efficiency. They also expected democracy and laissez-faire economics to diminish the frequency of war.}}

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', Smith argued that as societies progressed from hunter gatherers to industrial societies the spoils of war would rise, but that the costs of war would rise further and thus making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[T]he honours, the fame, the emoluments of war, belong not to [the middle and industrial classes]; the battle-plain is the harvest field of the aristocracy, watered with the blood of the people...Whilst our trade rested upon our foreign dependencies, as was the case in the middle of the last century...force and violence, were necessary to command our customers for our manufacturers...But war, although the greatest of consumers, not only produces nothing in return, but, by abstracting labour from productive employment and interrupting the course of trade, it impedes, in a variety of indirect ways, the creation of wealth; and, should hostilities be continued for a series of years, each successive war-loan will be felt in our commercial and manufacturing districts with an augmented pressure|[[Richard Cobden]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Stringham, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1676244 "Commerce, Markets, and Peace: Richard Cobden's Enduring Lessons"], ''Independent Review'' 9, no. 1 (2004): 105, 110, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}
{{quote|[B]y virtue of their mutual interest does nature unite people against violence and war, for the concept of cosmopolitan right does not protect them from it. The spirit of trade cannot coexist with war, and sooner or later this spirit dominates every people. For among all those powers (or means) that belong to a nation, financial power may be the most reliable in forcing nations to pursue the noble cause of peace (though not from moral motives); and wherever in the world war threatens to break out, they will try to head it off through mediation, just as if they were permanently leagued for this purpose.|[[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], ''The Perpetual Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small, but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets. The belief that free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), who was a classical liberal in his early life, to say that this was a doctrine on which he was "brought up" and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-9780198292364;jsessionid=4B0FEAE67C6CC2944F0147AFD5045F62?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp; ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''], Oxford University Press, 2006, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of a book on Keynes, Michael S. Lawlor argues that it may be in large part due to Keynes' contributions in economics and politics, as in the implementation of the [[Marshall Plan]] and the way economies have been managed since his work, "that we have the luxury of not facing his unpalatable choice between free trade and full employment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://eh.net/book_reviews/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-economic-paths-to-war-and-peace/ John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace]  Donald Markwell (2006), reviewed by M S Lawlor (February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A related manifestation of this idea was the argument of [[Norman Angell]] (1872–1967), most famously before World War I in ''[[The Great Illusion]]'' (1909), that the interdependence of the economies of the major powers was now so great that war between them was futile and irrational; and therefore unlikely.

A '''concurrent majority''', in [[US history]], was a constitutional rule proposed to enable minorities to block the actions of majorities. In the [[United States]], its most vocal proponents have tended to be minority groups, such as farmers in an urban-majority society or slaveowning Southerners protesting national policies that encroached on their privileges and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dreams of a More Perfect Union|last = Kersh|first = Rogan|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Ithaca and New York|pages = 141–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concurrent majority was intended to prevent the [[tyranny of the majority]] that proponents feared might arise in an unlimited [[democracy]].

==Background==
Prior to the [[American Revolution]], most governments were controlled by small minorities of ruling élites. Most of the population was completely [[enfranchisement|disfranchised]], even in countries like [[Switzerland]] whose governments (local, regional, and federal) were democratic by contemporary standards. The conception of government that materialized during the separation of the United States from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] marked a movement away from such control towards wider suffrage. The problem of tyranny then became a problem of limiting the majority's power.

==US Constitution==
Even so, the widening of the franchise caused concern. The framers of the [[US Constitution]], even while they reiterated that the people held national [[sovereignty]], worked to ensure that a simple majority of voters could not infringe upon the [[liberty]] of the rest of the people. One protection was [[separation of powers]], such as [[bicameralism]] in the [[US Congress]] and the three branches of the national government: legislative, executive, and judicial.

Having two houses was intended to serve as a brake on popular movements that might threaten particular groups, with the [[US House of Representatives]] representing the common people and the [[US Senate]] defending the interests of the state governments. The House was to be elected by popular vote, and the Senate was to be chosen by state legislatures. The executive veto and the implied power of [[judicial review]], which was later made explicit by the [[US Supreme Court]], created further obstacles to absolute majority rule.

Furthermore, the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], more familiarly known at the time as the "federal ratio," allowed slaves to count as three fifths of free men for the purposes of representation and taxation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Negro President: Jefferson and the Slave Power|last = Wills|first = Garry|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = xv-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compromise secured Southern votes for ratification of the Constitution and ensured disproportionate influence to Southerners for the first 50 years of the Constitution's history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Calhoun and nullification==
During the first half of the 19th century, [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]] revived and expounded upon the concurrent majority doctrine. An ardent advocate of [[states' rights]], he served as [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] and senator.

He noted that the [[Northern United States|North]], with its industrial economy, had become far more populous than the [[Southern United States|South]]. As the South's dependence on slavery sharply differentiated its agricultural economy from the North's, the difference in power afforded by population threatened interests that Calhoun considered essential to the South.

However, national policy became more and more driven on expansion and developing internal markets and infrastructure. With such changes, the South perceived more and more risks to its position and Calhoun became the most strident spokesman for sectionalism of his region.

His theory of the "concurrent majority," elaborated in his posthumous work of political theory ''[[A Disquisition on Government]]'' (1851),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = John C. Calhoun: Disquisition on Government|url = http://www.constitution.org/jcc/disq_gov.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued a method for protecting voting minorities from the tyranny of the majority, but his position on nullification argued the importance of protecting his region from high tariffs, essential for its export-focused economy. In life, Calhoun had been a leading proponent of the concept of [[nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], as he most forcefully articulated in the 1828 ''[[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]'', which was published anonymously while he was vice president, in response to the protectionist [[Tariff of 1828]], also called the "Tariff of Abominations."

Nullification, an outgrowth of Jeffersonian [[compact theory]], held that any state, as part of its rights as sovereign parties to the Constitution, had the power to declare specific federal laws void within its borders if it considered the law to be unconstitutional. Therefore, under Calhoun's schema, a law required two forms of majorities: a majority of the federal legislature and a concurrent majority of the legislatures of each state. It was on that authority in 1832 that South Carolina passed the [[Ordinance of Nullification]] on the Tariff of 1828 and its successor, the [[Tariff of 1832]], thus beginning the [[Nullification Crisis]]. [[Andrew Jackson]] responded with the [[Force Bill]], but armed conflict was avoided after the [[Tariff of 1833]] was passed, the compromise being largely the work of Calhoun.

A '''conscience vote''' or '''free vote''' is a type of vote in a [[legislature|legislative body]] where legislators are allowed to vote according to their own personal [[conscience]] rather than according to an official line set down by their [[political party]]. It can also be used to indicate [[crossbencher|crossbench]] members of a [[hung parliament]] where [[confidence and supply]] is provided to allow formation of a [[minority government]] but the right to vote on conscience is retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspg.org.au/pdf/Understanding%20conscience%20vote%20decisions.pdf|publisher=Australian Study of Parliament Group|title=Understanding Conscience Vote Decisions: The Case of the ACT|work=Australian Parliamentary Review|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp20|title=Conscience votes during the Howard Government 1996 - 2007|date=2 February 2009|publisher=Australian Parliament House}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Free votes'' are found in Canadian and some British legislative bodies, ''conscience votes'' in Australian and New Zealand legislative bodies.

In many [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], particularly those that follow the [[parliamentary system]] of government, the elected members of a legislature who belong to a political party are usually required by that party to vote in accordance with the [[party line (politics)|party line]] on significant legislation, on pain of censure or expulsion from the party. Sometimes a particular party member known as the [[whip (politics)|whip]] is responsible for maintaining this [[party discipline]].&lt;ref name="ukparl"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Priddy|first1=Sarah|title=Free votes in the House of Commons since 1997|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04793/SN04793.pdf|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=22 April 2017|format=PDF|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of a conscience vote, a party declines to dictate an official party line to follow and members may vote as they please. In countries where party discipline is less important and voting against one's party is more common, conscience votes are generally less important.

In most countries, conscience votes are quite rare and are often about issues which are very contentious, or a matter on which the members of any single party differ in their opinions, thus making it difficult for parties to formulate official policies. Usually, a conscience vote will be about religious, moral or ethical issues rather than about administrative or financial ones. Matters such as the [[prohibition|prohibition of alcohol]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]] law reform and the legality of [[prostitution]] are often subject to conscience votes. 

Sometimes a vote may be free for some parties but not for others. For instance, when the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] [[Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage|proposed a motion to re-open the debate on]] Canada's [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage laws]], his Conservatives and the opposition [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] declared it a free vote for their members, while the [[Bloc Québécois]] and the [[New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] both maintained party discipline to defeat the measure.

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[British House of Commons]] there used to be a conscience vote every few years on the restoration of the [[death penalty]], which had been abolished in 1964 (except for [[treason]], for which it was abolished in 1998 in the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]]). It had always been rejected and this practice has now been abandoned. In Britain, laws concerning [[abortion]] have always been subject to a free vote.

The proposed bans on [[fox hunting|hunting with dogs]] proposed by [[Tony Blair]]'s government were the subject of several free votes in Parliament from 2001.&lt;ref name="ukparl" /&gt; On each occasion the Commons voted for a ban and the [[House of Lords]] rejected it. In 2004 the Government, trying to placate the Lords and other opponents of a ban, proposed only restriction and licensing of hunting but anti-hunting MPs (mostly [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[backbencher]]s) forced through an amendment which would effect a total ban. Seconds after the vote on the amendment, the Government bowed to pressure and agreed to force the ban through the Lords under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. It passed in November 2004.

Other decisions which were taken by a free vote include abandoning the experiment with permanent [[daylight saving time|summer time]] and bringing television cameras into Parliament.

== Global use of the conscience vote==
Conscience votes have been held in [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliaments]] on issues of [[Republicanism in Australia|becoming a republic]], [[Abortion in Australia|abortion]], euthanasia, homosexuality, sex discrimination, prostitution, and bioethical issues like assisted reproduction and stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULawRw/2011/5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Zealand Parliament]], conscience votes differ from party votes in that MPs must physically enter a lobby to vote on a motion rather than a party's [[whip (politics)|whip]] calling out the votes on behalf of its MPs. A personal vote can be requested after a contested voice vote by any MP, but whether a personal or party vote is held is at the discretion of the [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Pieces of legislation which were treated as conscience issues in New Zealand include the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]], [[Prostitution Reform Act 2003]], [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]], [[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013]] and the present [[End of Life Choice Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/the-house/audio/2018670140/when-mps-go-with-their-gut-what-is-a-conscience-vote |title=When MPs go with their gut: what is a conscience vote? |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=13 November 2018 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parties exercise comparatively little control over the votes of individual legislators who are almost always free to vote as they wish. Accordingly, most legislative votes in the United States can be considered free votes, although in rare circumstances a legislator may be disciplined by his or her party for a renegade vote. Such discipline usually occurs only on votes regarding procedural matters on which party unity is expected as a matter of course, rather than substantive matters. For example, Democrat [[James Traficant]] was stripped of his seniority and committee assignments in 2001 when he voted for a Republican, [[Dennis Hastert]], to be [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]]. Because free votes are the norm in the United States, the terms "free vote" and "conscience vote" are generally unused and unknown there.

{{Democracy}}
{{Forms of government}}

'''Direct democracy''' or '''pure democracy''' is a form of [[democracy]] in which people decide on policy [[initiatives]] directly. This differs from the majority of most currently established democracies, which are [[representative democracy|representative democracies]].

==Overview==
In a [[representative democracy]], people vote for representatives who then enact policy initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Budge |author-first=Ian |chapter=Direct democracy |editor=Clarke, Paul A.B. |editor2=Foweraker, Joe |title=Encyclopedia of Political Thought |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2001 |isbn=9780415193962 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srzDCqnZkfUC&amp;pg=PA224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In direct democracy, people decide on policies without any intermediary. Depending on the particular system in use, direct democracy might entail passing executive decisions, the use of [[sortition]], making [[law]]s, directly electing or dismissing officials, and conducting [[trial]]s. Two leading forms of direct democracy are [[participatory democracy]] and [[deliberative democracy]].

[[Semi-direct democracies]] in which representatives administer day-to-day governance, but the citizens remain the sovereign, allow for three forms of popular action: [[referendum]] (plebiscite), [[initiative]], and [[recall election|recall]]. The first two forms—referendums and initiatives—are examples of direct legislation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democratic Innovations: Designing Institutions for Citizen Participation (Theories of Institutional Design)|last = Smith|first = Graham|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'compulsory referendum' subjects the legislation drafted by political elites to a binding popular vote. This is the most common form of direct legislation. A 'popular referendum' empowers citizens to make a petition that calls existing legislation to a vote by the citizens. Institutions specify the timeframe for a valid petition and the number of signatures required, and may require signatures from diverse communities to protect minority interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This form of direct democracy effectively grants the voting public a [[veto]] on laws adopted by the elected legislature, as is done in [[Switzerland]].{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011a}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011b}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011c}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011d}}

A 'citizen-initiated referendum' (also called an [[initiative]]) empowers members of the general public to propose, by petition, specific statutory measures or constitutional reforms to the government and, as with referendums, the vote may be binding or simply advisory. Initiatives may be direct or indirect: With the direct initiative, a successful proposition is placed directly on the ballot to be subject to vote (as exemplified by California's system).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With an indirect initiative, a successful proposition is first presented to the legislature for their consideration; however, if no acceptable action is taken after a designated period of time, the proposition moves to direct popular vote.

A [[deliberative referendum]] is a referendum that increases public deliberation through purposeful institutional design.

==History==
{{See also|History of democracy}}
The earliest known direct democracy is said to be the [[Athenian democracy]] in the 5th century BC, although it was not an inclusive democracy: women, foreigners, and [[slavery|slaves]] were excluded from it. The main bodies in the Athenian democracy were the [[Popular assembly|assembly]], composed of male citizens; the [[boule (ancient Greece)|boulê]], composed of 500 citizens; and the law courts, composed of a massive number of jurors chosen by lot, with no judges. There were only about 30,000 male citizens, but several thousand of them were politically active in each year, and many of them quite regularly for years on end. The Athenian democracy was ''direct'' not only in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also in the sense that the people through the assembly, boulê, and law courts controlled the entire political process, and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.&lt;ref name="Raaflaub5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Raaflaub|Ober|Wallace|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern democracies, being representative, not direct, do not resemble the Athenian system.

Also relevant to the history of direct democracy is the history of [[Ancient Rome]], specifically the [[Roman Republic]], beginning around 509&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=cary67&gt;{{Harvnb|Cary|Scullard|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome displayed many aspects of democracy, both direct and indirect, from the era of [[Roman Kingdom|Roman monarchy]] all the way to the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]]. Indeed, the [[Roman senate|Senate]], formed in the first days of the city, lasted through the Kingdom, Republic, and Empire, and even continued after the decline of Western Rome; and its structure and regulations continue to influence legislative bodies worldwide. As to direct democracy, the ancient Roman Republic had a system of citizen lawmaking, or citizen formulation and passage of law, and a citizen veto of legislature-made law. Many historians mark the end of the Republic with the passage of a law named the ''[[Lex Titia]]'', 27 November 43 BC, which eliminated many oversight provisions.&lt;ref name=cary67/&gt;

Modern-era citizen lawmaking began in the towns of [[Switzerland]] in the 13th century. In 1847, the Swiss added the "statute referendum" to their national constitution. They soon discovered that merely having the power to veto Parliament's laws was not enough. In 1891, they added the "constitutional amendment initiative". Swiss politics since 1891 have given the world a valuable experience base with the national-level constitutional amendment initiative.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kobach|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past 120 years, more than 240 initiatives have been put to referendums. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of these initiatives; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government. (See ''[[#Switzerland|Direct democracy in Switzerland]]'' below.){{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011a}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011b}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011c}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011d}}

Some of the issues surrounding the related notion of a direct democracy using the [[Internet]] and other communications technologies are dealt with in [[e-democracy]] and below under the term ''electronic direct democracy''. More concisely, the concept of [[open source governance]] applies principles of the [[free software movement]] to the governance of people, allowing the entire populace to participate in government directly, as much or as little as they please.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Open Source Democracy|last = Rushkoff|first = Douglas|publisher = Project Gutenberg Self-Publishing|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Project Gutenburg|pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10753/pg10753.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Early Athens===
{{Main|Athenian democracy}}
Athenian democracy developed in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of [[Attica]], around 600 BC. Athens was one of the [[History of democracy#Athens|very first known democracies]]. Other Greek cities set up democracies, and even though most followed an Athenian model, none were as powerful, stable, or well-documented as that of Athens. In the direct democracy of Athens, the citizens did not nominate representatives to vote on legislation and executive bills on their behalf (as in the United States) but instead voted as individuals. The [[public opinion]] of voters was influenced by the [[political satire]] of the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comic poets]] in the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1996) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp. 307–19 in {{Cite book|editor=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solon]] (694 BC), [[Cleisthenes]] (608–607 BCE), and [[Ephialtes]] (562 BC) all contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Historians differ on which of them was responsible for which institution, and which of them most represented a truly democratic movement. It is most usual to date Athenian democracy from Cleisthenes, since Solon's constitution fell and was replaced by the tyranny of [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]], whereas Ephialtes revised Cleisthenes' constitution relatively peacefully.
[[Hipparchus (son of Pisistratus)|Hipparchus]], the brother of the tyrant [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]], was killed by [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], who were subsequently honored by the Athenians for their alleged restoration of Athenian freedom.

The greatest and longest-lasting democratic leader was [[Pericles]]; after his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolution towards the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under [[Eucleides]]; the most detailed accounts are of this 4th-century modification rather than of the Periclean system. It was suppressed by the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]] in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but the extent to which they were a real democracy is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Elster|1978|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], with no need to register, every citizen receives the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each vote, and can return it by post. Switzerland has various directly democratic instruments; votes are organised about four times a year.]]
{{Main|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}
{{Further|Landsgemeinde|Federal popular initiative}}

The pure form of direct democracy exists only in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]].&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; The [[Swiss Confederation]] is a semi-direct democracy (representative democracy with strong instruments of direct democracy).&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; The nature of direct democracy in Switzerland is fundamentally complemented by its federal governmental structures (in [[German language|German]] also called the [[:de:Subsidiaritätsprinzip&lt;!-- please note that the English WP article about Subsidiarity does not (yet) reflect/discuss the political/governmental nature in a satisfiying quality, therefore referring to the German Article here --&gt;|Subsidiaritätsprinzip]]).{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011a}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011b}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011c}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011d}}

Most western countries have representative systems.&lt;ref name=Golay&gt;Vincent Golay and Mix et Remix, ''Swiss political institutions'', Éditions loisirs et pédagogie, 2008. {{ISBN|978-2-606-01295-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] is a rare example of a country with instruments of direct democracy (at the levels of the municipalities, [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], and [[Politics of Switzerland|federal state]]). Citizens have more power than in a representative democracy. On any political level citizens can propose changes to the constitution ([[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]]), or ask for an [[optional referendum]] to be held on any law voted by the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|federal]], [[cantonal]] parliament and/or [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipal]] legislative body.&lt;ref name=refdum&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ch.ch/en/referendum |title=Referendums |publisher=Swiss Confederation |website=ch.ch – A service of the Confederation, cantons and communes |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list for [[mandatory referendum|mandatory]] or optional referendums on each political level are generally much longer in Switzerland than in any other country; for example any amendment to the constitution must automatically be voted on by the Swiss electorate and cantons, on cantonal/communal levels often any financial decision of a certain substantial amount decreed by legislative and/or executive bodies as well.&lt;ref name=refdum/&gt;

Swiss citizens vote regularly on any kind of issue on every political level, such as financial approvals of a school house or the building of a new street, or the change of the policy regarding sexual work, or on constitutional changes, or on the foreign policy of Switzerland, four times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/checks-and-balances_the-swiss-vote-more-than-any-other-country/36286970 |title=The Swiss vote more than any other country|author=Julia Slater |publisher=swissinfo.ch – the international service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2013 |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, on 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/explore-600-national-votes_how-direct-democracy-has-grown-over-the-decades/41481992 |title=How direct democracy has grown over the decades |author=Duc-Quang Nguyen |publisher=swissinfo.ch – the international service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 June 2015 |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums.&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt;

In [[Switzerland]], simple majorities are sufficient at the municipal and [[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] level, but at the federal level [[Double majority|double majorities]] are required on constitutional issues.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt;

A double majority requires approval by a majority of individuals voting, and also by a majority of cantons. Thus, in Switzerland a citizen-proposed amendment to the federal constitution (i.e. [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]]) cannot be passed at the federal level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt; For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the principle of a general revision of the Constitution), a majority of those voting is sufficient (Swiss Constitution, 2005).

In 1890, when the provisions for Swiss national citizen lawmaking were being debated by civil society and government, the Swiss adopted the idea of double majorities from the [[United States Congress]], in which House votes were to represent the people and Senate votes were to represent the [[U.S. state|states]].&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt; According to its supporters, this "legitimacy-rich" approach to national citizen lawmaking has been very successful. Kris Kobach claims that Switzerland has had tandem successes both socially and economically which are matched by only a few other nations. Kobach states at the end of his book, "Too often, observers deem Switzerland an oddity among political systems. It is more appropriate to regard it as a pioneer." Finally, the Swiss political system, including its direct democratic devices in a [[multi-level governance]] context, becomes increasingly interesting for scholars of [[European Union]] integration.&lt;ref&gt;Trechsel (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Commune===

{{Main|Paris Commune}}

In 1871 after the establishment of the Paris Commune, the Parisians established a decentralized direct system of government with appointed organizers to make sense of the largely spontaneous uprising. While it still refused women the right to vote, they were heavily involved in the consensus before votes took place. Everything from the military to when meetings took place was democratized, and such decentralization and aforementioned democratization led many members of the First Internationale to regard the Paris Commune as a stateless society.

Due to the short lifespan of the Commune, only one citywide election was held and the structures necessary to facilitate future organized elections on large scales was largely nonexistent. However, the influence of direct democratization in the Paris Commune is not to be understated.

===United States===
{{Main|History of direct democracy in the United States|Initiatives and referendums in the United States}}

In the [[New England]] region of the United States, [[New England town|towns]] in areas such as [[Vermont]] decide local affairs through the direct democratic process of the [[town meeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2A35hJAR7u0C&amp;pg=PR7|title=Real Democracy: The New England Town Meeting and How It Works|first=Frank M.|last=Bryan|date=15 March 2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=27 April 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the oldest form of direct democracy in the United States, and predates the founding of the country by at least a century.

Direct democracy was not what the framers of the [[United States Constitution]] envisioned for the nation. They saw a danger in [[tyranny of the majority]]. As a result, they advocated a [[representative democracy]] in the form of a constitutional republic over a direct democracy. For example, [[James Madison]], in [[Federalist No. 10]], advocates a constitutional republic over direct democracy precisely to protect the individual from the will of the majority. He says,

{{quote|Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.

[...]

[A] pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will be felt by a majority, and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party. Hence it is, that democracies have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have, in general, been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm The Federalist No. 10&amp;nbsp;– The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection (continued)&amp;nbsp;– Daily Advertiser&amp;nbsp;– November 22, 1787&amp;nbsp;– James Madison]. Retrieved 2007-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Witherspoon]], one of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], said: "Pure democracy cannot subsist long nor be carried far into the departments of state&amp;nbsp;– it is very subject to caprice and the madness of popular rage." [[Alexander Hamilton]] said, "That a pure democracy if it were practicable would be the most perfect government. Experience has proved that no position is more false than this. The ancient democracies in which the people themselves deliberated never possessed one good feature of government. Their very character was tyranny; their figure, deformity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zagarri|2010|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the framers' intentions in the beginning of the republic, ballot measures and their corresponding referendums have been widely used at the state and sub-state level. There is much state and federal [[case law]], from the early 1900s to the 1990s, that protects the people's right to each of these direct democracy governance components (Magleby, 1984, and Zimmerman, 1999). The first [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling in favor of the citizen lawmaking was in ''Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Oregon'', 223 U.S. 118 in 1912 (Zimmerman, December 1999). [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], in his "Charter of Democracy" speech to the 1912 [[Ohio]] constitutional convention, stated: "I believe in the Initiative and Referendum, which should be used not to destroy representative government, but to correct it whenever it becomes misrepresentative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watts|2010|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various states, referendums through which the people rule include:
* ''Referrals'' by the legislature to the people of "proposed constitutional amendments" (constitutionally used in 49 states, excepting only [[Delaware]]&amp;nbsp;– Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute, 2004).
* ''Referrals'' by the legislature to the people of "proposed statute laws" (constitutionally used in all 50 states&amp;nbsp;– Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute, 2004).
* ''Constitutional amendment initiative'' is a constitutionally-defined petition process of "proposed constitutional law", which, if successful, results in its provisions being written directly into the state's constitution. Since constitutional law cannot be altered by state legislatures, this direct democracy component gives the people an automatic superiority and sovereignty, over representative government (Magelby, 1984). It is utilized at the state level in nineteen states: [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[Nevada]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Oregon]] and [[South Dakota]] (Cronin, 1989). Among these states, there are three main types of the constitutional amendment initiative, with different degrees of involvement of the state legislature distinguishing between the types (Zimmerman, December 1999).
* ''Statute law initiative'' is a constitutionally-defined, citizen-initiated petition process of "proposed statute law", which, if successful, results in law being written directly into the state's statutes. The statute initiative is used at the state level in twenty-one states: [[Alaska]], Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, [[Idaho]], [[Maine]], Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, [[Utah]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]] (Cronin, 1989). Note that, in Utah, there is no constitutional provision for citizen lawmaking. All of Utah's I&amp;R law is in the state statutes (Zimmerman, December 1999). In most states, there is no special protection for citizen-made statutes; the legislature can begin to amend them immediately.
* ''Statute law referendum'' is a constitutionally-defined, citizen-initiated petition process of the "proposed veto of all or part of a legislature-made law", which, if successful, repeals the standing law. It is used at the state level in twenty-four states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, [[Kentucky]], Maine, [[Maryland]], Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, [[New Mexico]], North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming (Cronin, 1989).
* The ''[[recall election]]'' is a citizen-initiated process which, if successful, removes an elected official from office and replaces him or her. The first recall device in the United States was adopted in [[Los Angeles]] in 1903. Typically, the process involves the collection of citizen petitions for the recall of an elected official; if a sufficient number of valid signatures and collected and verified, a recall election is triggered. In U.S. history, there have been three gubernatorial recall elections in U.S. history (two of which resulted in the recall of the governor) and 38 recall elections for state legislators (55% of which succeeded). 
: Nineteen states and the [[District of Columbia]] have a recall function for state officials. Additional states have recall functions for local jurisdictions. Some states require specific grounds for a recall petition campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx Recall of State Officials], National Conference of State Legislatures (March 8, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zapatistas ===
[[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities|Territories held by the Zapatistas]] in [[Mexico]] also employ elements of direct democracy. At a local level, people attend a [[general assembly]] of around 300 families where anyone over the age of 12 can participate in decision-making, these assemblies strive to reach a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] but are willing to fall back to a majority vote. Each community has 3 main administrative structures: (1) the ''commissariat'', in charge of day-to day administration; (2) the ''council for land control'', which deals with forestry and disputes with neighboring communities; and (3) the ''agencia'', a community police agency. The communities form a federation with other communities to create an autonomous municipalities, which form further federations with other municipalities to create a region. The Zapatistas are composed of five regions, in total having a population of around 300,000 people.

=== Rojava ===
In Syrian Kurdistan, in the cantons of [[Rojava]], a new model of polity is exercised by the Kurdish freedom movement, that of [[Democratic confederalism]]. This model has been developed by [[Abdullah Öcalan]], the leader of the [[Kurdistan Worker's Party|Kurdistan Workers' Party]], on the basis of the Kurdish revolutionary experience and traditions, and of the theory of [[Libertarian Municipalism|Communalism]] developed by [[Murray Bookchin]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite of the [[Nation state|Nation-State]] model of sovereignty, Democratic confederalism rests on the principle of radical self-government, where political decisions are taken in popular assemblies at the level of the commune, which will send delegates to the confederate level of the district and the canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology or Catastrophe: The Life of Murray Bookchin|last=Biehl|first=Janet|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780199342495|location=Oxford|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bottom-up political structure coexists with the democratic self-administration, as organized in the [[Charter of the Social Contract]] adopted by the cantons of Rojava in 2014. These two structures constitute a situation characterized as one of dual power by [[David Graeber]], though a peculiar one as they are both formed by the same movement.&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other experiences categorized as ones of direct democracy such as OWS, the Rojava experiment presents only several elements of direct democracy, namely the organization of the self-governing communes in popular assemblies where everybody can participate, the confederation of these communes through imperative and recallable mandates, the rotation of charges (often biannually) and the absence of a centralized power.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, pp. 87-91.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, Öcalan describes the principle of Democratic Confederalism as follows: "In contrast to a centralist and bureaucratic understanding of administration and exercise of power confederalism poses a type of political self-administration where all groups of the society and all cultural identities can express themselves in local meetings, general conventions and councils.".&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Öcalan, ''Democratic Confederalism'', Cologne, 2011, bit.ly/1AUntIO, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Rojava is organized on a system of "Four Level Councils": the Commune, the Neighborhood, the District, and the People's Council of West Kurdistan. Each level nominates delegates for the next level with [[imperative mandate]]s as well as recallable mandates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As democratic autonomy rests on the equal political engagement of members of the community, the Kurdish women's movement aims at changing the historical exclusion of women from the public sphere as well as at educating women, creating space where they can participate and produce their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, pp. 43 and 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment to women's liberation is instantiated in the principle of dual leadership and 40 percent quota and in the many political spaces created for women's education as well as their political and economic emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan, London, Pluto Press, 2016, pp. 64-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are therefore fully included in the project of direct democracy. In order to contribute to their political emancipation, Kurdish women created a new science, [[Jineology|Jineologî]] or "women's science", in order to give to women access to knowledge, the very foundation of power in society.&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, political emancipation is not seen as sufficient to ensure women's liberation if it does not rest on the possibility of women for self-defense. Therefore, Kurdish women created the Women's Protection Units ([[Women's Protection Units|YPJ]]) which forms, along with the People's Protection Units ([[People's Protection Units|YPG]]), the Kurdish armed forces.

The [[Rojava]] cantons are governed through a combination of district and civil councils. District councils consist of 300 members as well as two elected co-presidents- one man and one woman. District councils decide and carry out administrative and economic duties such as garbage collection, land distribution and cooperative enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tax |first1=Meredith |title=The Revolution in Rojava |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-revolution-in-rojava|publisher=Dissent Magazin|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; `

==Democratic reform trilemma==
Democratic theorists have identified a [[trilemma]] due to the presence of three desirable characteristics of an ideal system of direct democracy, which are challenging to deliver all at once.  These three characteristics are ''participation'' – widespread participation in the decision making process by the people affected; ''deliberation'' – a rational discussion where all major points of view are weighted according to evidence; and ''equality'' –  all members of the population on whose behalf decisions are taken have an equal chance of having their views taken into account. [[Empirical evidence]] from dozens of studies suggests deliberation leads to better decision making.&lt;ref name="Ross 2011 loc= Chapter 3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ross|2011|loc= Chapter 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stokes1998&gt;{{Harvnb|Stokes|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Even Susan Strokes in her critical essay ''Pathologies of Deliberation'' concedes that a majority of academics in the field agree with this view.&lt;/ref&gt; The most popularly disputed form of direct popular participation is the referendum on constitutional matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, K. "Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia", ''Juridica International''.], {{ISSN|1406-5509}} Vol. 20, 2013. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

For the system to respect the principle of political equality, either ''everyone'' needs to be involved or there needs to be a representative random sample of people chosen to take part in the discussion. In the definition used by scholars such as [[James S. Fishkin|James Fishkin]], [[deliberative democracy]] is a form of direct democracy which satisfies the requirement for deliberation and equality but does not make provision to involve everyone who wants to be included in the discussion. [[Participatory democracy]], by Fishkin's definition, allows inclusive participation and deliberation, but at a cost of sacrificing equality, because if widespread participation is allowed, sufficient resources rarely will be available to compensate people who sacrifice their time to participate in the deliberation. Therefore, participants tend to be those with a strong interest in the issue to be decided and often will not therefore be representative of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;Fishkin suggests they may even have been directly mobilised by interest groups or be largely composed of people who have fallen for political propaganda and so have inflamed and distorted opinions.&lt;/ref&gt; Fishkin instead argues that random sampling should be used to select a small, but still representative, number of people from the general public.&lt;ref name="FishkinCh2&amp;3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross 2011 loc= Chapter 3"/&gt;

Fishkin concedes it is possible to imagine a system that transcends the trilemma, but it would require very radical reforms if such a system were to be integrated into mainstream politics.

Anarchists have advocated forms of direct democracy as an alternative to the centralized state and capitalism; however, others (such as [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]) have criticized direct democracy and democracy in general for ignoring the [[minority rights|rights of the minority]], and instead have advocated a form of [[consensus decision-making]]. [[Libertarian Marxism|Libertarian Marxists]], however, fully support direct democracy in the form of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat|proletarian republic]] and see majority rule and citizen participation as virtues.

'''East Riding County Council''' ('''ERCC''') was the [[county council]] of the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] from 1 April 1889 to 31 March 1974. 

The county council had jurisdiction over the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of the East Riding and therefore did not include the [[county borough]] of [[Kingston upon Hull]].

[[Image:Fasces.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|A ''fasces'' image, with the axe in the middle of the bundle of rods]]
'''Fasces''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|f|æ|s|iː|z}}, {{IPA-la|ˈfa.skeːs|lang}}; a ''[[plurale tantum]]'', from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:en:fascis#Latin|fascis]]'', meaning "bundle";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=fasces Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]: fasces&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-it|fascio littorio}}) is a bound bundle of wooden rods, sometimes including an axe with its blade emerging. The fasces had its origin in the [[Etruscan civilization]] and was passed on to [[ancient Rome]], where it symbolized a [[magistrate]]'s [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[jurisdiction]]. The axe originally associated with the symbol, the [[Labrys]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|xld-Grek|λάβρυς}}, ''{{lang|xld-Latn|lábrys}}'') the double-[[Axe#Parts of the axe|bitted]] [[axe]], originally from [[Crete]], is one of the oldest symbols of Greek civilization. To the Romans, it was known as a ''bipennis''.&lt;ref&gt;the term for a single-bladed axe being ''hēmipelekys'' "half-pelekys", e.g. [[Iliad|Il]]. 23.883.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, the symbol was associated with [[female deities]], from prehistoric through historic times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The image has survived in the modern world as a representation of magisterial or collective power, law and governance. The fasces frequently occurs as a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]: it is present on the reverse of the U.S. [[Mercury dime]] coin and behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]]; and it was the origin of the name of the [[National Fascist Party]] in Italy (from which the term ''[[fascism]]'' is derived).

During the first half of the 20th century both the fasces and the [[swastika]] (each symbol having its own unique ancient religious and mythological associations) became heavily identified with the [[authoritarian]]/[[Fascism|fascist]] political movements of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].  During this period the swastika became deeply stigmatized, but the fasces did not undergo a similar process.

The fact that the fasces remained in use in many societies after [[World War II]] may have been due to the fact that prior to Mussolini the fasces had already been adopted and incorporated within the governmental iconography of many governments outside Italy. As such, its use persists as an accepted form of governmental and other iconography in various contexts. (The [[swastika]] remains in common usage in parts of Asia for religious purposes which are also unrelated to early 20th century European fascism.)

The fasces is sometimes confused with the related term ''[[fess]]'', which in [[French heraldry]] is called a ''fasce''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Origin and symbolism==
[[File:Fasces in the Sheldonian Theatre.jpg|thumb|Ornamentation consisting of fasces held in the mouth of a lion inside the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] at Oxford University]]
A few artifacts found showing a thin bundle of rods surrounding a two-headed axe point to a possible Etruscan origin for fasces, but little is known about the Etruscans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, S. (2000). Etruscan civilization: A cultural history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Fasces symbolism might be derived via the Etruscans from the eastern Mediterranean, with the [[labrys]], the [[Anatolia]]n, and [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] double-headed axe, later incorporated into the [[praetor]]ial fasces. There is little archaeological evidence for precise claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Roman Republic]], the fasces had developed into a thicker bundle of [[Betula pubescens|birch]] rods, sometimes surrounding a single-headed axe and tied together with a red leather ribbon into a cylinder. On certain special occasions, the fasces might be decorated with a [[laurel wreath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of the fasces could suggest strength through unity (see [[Unity makes strength]]); a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is very difficult to break. This symbolism occurs in [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] "[[The Old Man and his Sons]]". A similar story is told about the [[Bulgar]] (pre-Bulgarian, proto-Bulgarian) Khan [[Kubrat]], giving rise to the Bulgarian national motto "Union gives strength" (Съединението прави силата). However, bundled birch twigs could also symbolise [[corporal punishment]] (see [[birching]]).

==Republican Rome==
The ''fasces lictoriae'' ("bundles of the lictors") [[symbol]]ised power and authority (''[[imperium]]'') in ancient [[Rome]], beginning with the early [[Roman Kingdom]] and continuing through the republican and [[Roman Empire|imperial]] periods. By republican times, use of the fasces was surrounded with tradition and protocol. A corps of ''apparitores'' (subordinate officials) called [[lictors]] each carried fasces before a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]], in a number corresponding to his rank. Lictors preceded [[Roman consul|consul]]s (and [[proconsul]]s), [[praetor]]s (and [[propraetor]]s), [[Roman dictator|dictator]]s, curule [[aedile]]s, [[quaestor]]s, and the [[Flamen Dialis]] during [[Roman triumph]]s (public celebrations held in Rome after a military conquest).

According to Livy, it is likely that the lictors were an Etruscan tradition, adopted by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8&lt;/ref&gt; The highest magistrate, the ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'', was entitled to twenty-four lictors and fasces, the consul to twelve, the proconsul eleven, the praetor six (two within the ''[[pomerium]]''), the propraetor five, and the curule aediles two.

Another part of the symbolism developed in Republican Rome was the inclusion of just a single-headed axe in the fasces, with the blade projecting from the bundle. The axe indicated that the magistrate's judicial powers (''[[imperium]]'') included capital punishment. Fasces carried within the ''[[Pomerium]]''—the boundary of the sacred inner city of Rome—had their axe blades removed; within the city, the power of life and death rested with the people through their assemblies. During times of emergency, however, the Roman Republic might choose a dictator to lead for a limited time period, who was the only magistrate to be granted capital punishment authority within the Pomerium. Lictors attending the dictator kept the axes in their fasces even inside the Pomerium—a sign that the dictator had the ultimate power in his own hands. There were exceptions to this rule: in 48 BC, guards holding bladed fasces guided [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 48 BCE)|Vatia Isauricus]] to the tribunal of [[Marcus Caelius Rufus|Marcus Caelius]], and Vatia Isauricus used one to destroy Caelius's magisterial chair (''[[Curule Chair|sella curulis]]'').{{Clear}}

An occasional variation on the fasces was the addition of a [[laurel wreath]], symbolizing victory. This occurred during the celebration of a ''[[Roman triumph|Triumph]]'' - essentially a victory parade through Rome by a returning victorious general. Previously, all Republican Roman commanding generals had held high office with imperium, and so, already were entitled to the lictors and fasces.

==Usage==
The modern Italian word ''[[fascio]]'', used in the twentieth century to designate peasant cooperatives and industrial workers' unions, is related to ''fasces''.

Numerous governments and other authorities have used the image of the ''fasces'' as a [[symbol]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] since the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. It also has been used to hearken back to the Roman republic, particularly by those who see themselves as modern-day successors to the old republic or its ideals.

[[Coat of arms of Ecuador|The Ecuadorian coat of arms]] incorporated the fasces in 1830, although it had already been in use in the coat of arm of [[Gran Colombia]] since 1821.

[[Italian Fascism]], which derives its name from the ''fasces'', arguably used this symbolism the most in the twentieth century. The [[British Union of Fascists]] also used it in the 1930s. The ''fasces'', as a widespread and long-established symbol in the West, however, has avoided the [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with much of [[fascist symbolism]], and many authorities continue to display them, including the federal government of the United States.

===France===
A review of the images included in ''Les Grands Palais de France ''Fontainebleau'' ''&lt;ref&gt;''Les Grands Palais de France '''Fontainebleau''', I re Série, Styles Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch. Eggimann, Succ, 106, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les Grands Palais de France : Fontainebleau '', II me Série, Les Appartments D'Anne D'Autriche, De François I er, Et D'Elenonre La Chapelle, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch. Eggimann, Succ, 106, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris, 1912&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that French architects used the Roman fasces (''faisceaux romains'') as a decorative device as early as the reign of [[Louis XIII]] (1610–1643) and continued to employ it through the periods of [[Napoleon I]]'s Empire (1804–1815).

The fasces typically appeared in a context reminiscent of the [[Roman Republic]] and of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[French Revolution]] used many references to the ancient [[Roman Republic]] in its imagery. During the [[French First Republic|First Republic]], topped by the [[Phrygian cap]], the fasces is a tribute to the Roman Republic and means that power belongs to the people. It also symbolizes the "unity and indivisibility of the Republic",&lt;ref name="elysee1"&gt;[http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-faisceau-de-licteur/le-faisceau-de-licteur.5979.html Site of the French Presidency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104072203/http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-faisceau-de-licteur/le-faisceau-de-licteur.5979.html |date=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as stated in the [[French Constitution]].

Since the original founding of the United States in the 18th century, several offices and institutions in the United States have heavily incorporated representations of the ''fasces'' into much of their iconography.

==== Federal fasces iconography ====
* The reverse of the [[Mercury Dime]], the design used until the adoption of the current FDR dime in 1945, features a fasces.
* In the [[Oval Office]], above the door leading to the exterior walkway, and above the corresponding door on the opposite wall, which leads to the president's private office; note: the fasces depicted have no axes, possibly because in the [[Roman Republic]], the blade was always removed from the bundle whenever the ''fasces'' were carried inside the city, in order to symbolize the rights of citizens against arbitrary state power (see above)
* Two fasces appear on either side of the [[flag of the United States]] behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]], and were added to the chamber's decor during the remodeling project of 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Capitol/1951-Present/ US House of Representatives: Chamber, 1951–Present] history.house.gov website.  Downloaded Aug. 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Mace of the United States House of Representatives]] resembles fasces and consists of thirteen ebony rods bound together in the same fashion as the fasces, topped by a silver eagle on a globe 
* The official [[seal of the United States Senate]] has as one component a pair of crossed fasces
* Fasces ring the base of the [[Statue of Freedom]] atop the [[United States Capitol]] building 
* A frieze on the facade of the [[United States Supreme Court building]] depicts the figure of a Roman [[centurion]] holding a fasces, to represent "order"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c01_e.html The Supreme Court Historical Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128162002/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c01_e.html |date=November 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] uses the fasces on the seal of the [[National Guard Bureau]], and it appears in the insignia of Regular Army officers assigned to National Guard liaison and in the insignia and unit symbols of National Guard units themselves; for instance, the regimental crest of the [[71st Infantry Regiment (New York)]] of the New York National Guard consisted of a gold fasces set on a blue background 
* At the [[Lincoln Memorial]], Lincoln's seat of state bears the fasces—without axes—on the fronts of its arms; fasces also appear on the pylons flanking the main staircase leading into the memorial 
* The official [[seal (device)|seal]] of the [[United States Tax Court]] bears the fasces at its center

* A fasces also appears [[shoulder sleeve insignia]] of the [[United States Army Reserve Legal Command|U.S. Army Reserve Legal Command]]
* Seated beside George Washington, a figure holds a fasces as part of ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'', a fresco mural suspended above the rotunda of the [[United States Capitol Building]].

==== State, local and other fasces iconography ====
* The main entrance hallways in the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] have lamps that are decorated with stone fasces motifs; in the woodwork before the podium of the speaker of the assembly, several double-bladed fasces are carved, but in the woodwork before the podium of the senate president are several single-bladed fasces 
* The grand seal of [[Harvard University]] inside Memorial Church is flanked by two inward-pointing fasces; the seal is located directly below the 112&amp;nbsp;m (368&amp;nbsp;ft) steeple and the [[Great Seal of the United States]] inside the Memorial Room; the walls of the room list the names of Harvard students, faculty, and alumni who gave their lives in service of the [[United States]] during [[World War I]] along with an empty tomb depicting [[Alma Mater]] holding a slain Harvard student 
* The fasces appears on the [[Seal of Colorado|state seal of Colorado]], U.S., beneath the "All-seeing eye" (or [[Eye of Providence]]) and above the mountains and mines 
* The hallmark of the [[Kerr &amp; Co]] silver company was a fasces 
* On the seal of the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]], a figure carries a fasces; the seal appears on the borough flag; fasces also can be seen in the stone columns at [[Grand Army Plaza]] and on a flagpole in [[Washington Square Park]] 
* the symbol is used as part of the [[Knights of Columbus]] emblem (designed in 1883)
* Many local police departments use the fasces as part of their badges and other symbols, for instance, the top border of the Los Angeles Police Department badge features a fasces  (1940)
* Commercially, a small fasces appeared at the top of one of the insignia of the [[Hupmobile]] automobile 
* A fasces appears on the [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], made by Jean-Antoine Houdon that is now in the Virginia State Capital; fasces are used as posts of the 1818 cast-iron fence surrounding the capitol building 
* Columns in the form of fasces line the entrance to [[Buffalo City Hall]] 
* [[VAW-116]] have a fasces on their unit insignia 
* [[San Francisco]]'s [[Coit Tower]] has two fasces-like insignia (without the axe) carved above its entrance, flanking a [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] 
* Two monuments erected in [[Chicago]] at the time of the [[Century of Progress Exposition]] are adorned with fasces; the monument to [[Christopher Columbus (Grant Park)|Christopher Columbus]] (1933) in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] has them on the ends of its [[exedra]]; the ''[[Balbo Monument]]'' in [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]], (1934) a gift from [[Benito Mussolini]], has the vandalized remains of fasces on all four corners of its [[plinth]]&lt;ref&gt;Bach, Ira and Mary Lackritz Gray, ‘’A Guide to Chicago’s Public Sculpture'', The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1983 p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation sprang from the wider labour movements of the early 19th century, influenced by [[Chartism]] and campaigns for women's enfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofwomen.org/politicalpre1850.html|title=British Women's Emancipation since the Renaissance|last=|first=|date=|website=History of Women.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fildes, who had been present at the [[Peterloo Massacre]], had previously been president of the Manchester-based [[Society of Female Reformers]] (itself a response to [[Blackburn Female Reform Society]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The Manchester Female Reformers address to the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of the higher and middling classes of society".

Little is currently known of the workings of many of these societies, but they are evidence of a highly organised and committed group of working class activist women, at a time when culturally such participation was socially discouraged. Katrina Navickas writes about groups like those set up by Fildes that 'Northern working-class women challenged the middle-class notion of separate spheres not simply by entering the political public sphere, but conversely by asserting domestic concerns as public and political.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/944444550|title=Protest and the politics of space and place 1789–1848|last=Navickas,|first=Katrina|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7190-9705-8|location=Manchester|pages=79|oclc=944444550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8602">'''Formative contexts''' are the institutional and imaginative arrangements that shape a society's conflicts and resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek, David M. 1990. "Programmatic Thought and the Critique of the Social Disciplines." In Critique and Construction, ed. M Perry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the [[Social structure|structures]] that limit both the practice and the imaginative possibilities in a socio-political order, and in doing so shape the routines of conflict over social, political and economic resources that govern access to labor, loyalty, and social station, e.g. government power, economic capital, technological expertise, etc. In a formative context, the institutions structure conflict over government power and capital allocation, whereas the imaginative framework shapes the preconceptions about possible forms of human interaction. Through this, a formative context further creates and sustains a set of roles and ranks, which mold conflict over the mastery of resources and the shaping of the ideas of social possibilities, identities and interests. The formative context of the [[liberal democracy|Western democracies]], for example, include the organization of production through managers and laborers, a set of laws administering capital, a state in relation to the citizen, and a social division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York|pages=58–59, 69–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Also referred to as order, framework, or structure of social life, the concept of formative context was developed by philosopher and social theorist [[Roberto Unger]]. Whereas other social and political philosophers have taken the historical context as a given, and seen one existing set of institutional arrangements as necessarily giving birth to another set, Unger rejects this naturalization of the world and moves to explain how such contexts are made and reproduced. The most forceful articulation and development of the concept is in Unger's book ''False Necessity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The thesis of formative context is central to Unger's theory of [[false necessity]], which rejects the idea of a closed number of institutional arrangements of human societies, e.g. feudalism and capitalism, and that these arrangements are the product of historical necessity, as theories of [[liberalism]] or [[Marxism]] claim. Rather, Unger argues that there are myriad institutional arrangements that can coalesce, and that they do so through a contingent process of struggle, reconciliation, and innovation among individuals and groups. For Unger, the concept of formative context serves to explain the basis of a certain set of institutional arrangements and their reliance upon each other. It offers an explanation of the cycles of reform and retrenchment of a socio-economic political system and how it remains undisturbed by rivalries and animosities. The theory of false necessity goes on to explain the connections of a formative context, their making and remaking, and how they maintain stability despite the contingent formation.&lt;ref&gt;For good overviews of Unger's thought see Collins, Hugh. “Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement,” Journal of Law and Society 14 (1987), Trubek, David M. "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 95, no. 2 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
While a formative context of a society exerts a major influence on the course of [[social actions]] and behaviors, it is itself hard to challenge, revise, or even identify in the midst of everyday conflicts and routines. Thus there are two criteria for determining if an institution or structure belongs in a formative context, one subjective and one objective. The '''subjective criteria''' considers the perspective of the social actors themselves and the arrangements that are assumed in their speech and actions. For example, the attempts of big business and labor to protect themselves through deals with each other, and the political efforts of unorganized labor and petty bourgeoisie to undermine and circumvent these deals by pressuring the government, operate on the same institutional assumption of the distinction between economy and polity, and that victory in one can be offset by the other. The '''objective criteria''' is simply that if a substitution of the proposed structure affects the hierarchies or cyclical conflicts—if it alters the social divisions—then it can be included in the formative context. For example, a change in any one of the following conditions would completely change the formative context of a Western democratic state: if the state stopped being democratic or was democratic enough to allow collective militancy and subject private centers of power to public accountability; if business could have its way and override all regulatory controls of govt; or if no workers could unionize or all of them could and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = Social Theory, Its Situation and Its Task | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1987 | page=63| isbn = 978-0-521-32974-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=61–66| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western democracies==
The formative context of the North Atlantic democracies can be organized into four clusters of institutional arrangements: work, law, government, and occupational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=69–82| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''work-organization complex''' makes a distinction in work between task definers and task executers, with the material rewards concentrated in the task defining jobs.
*The '''private-rights complex''' understands the rights of the individual vis-a-vis other individuals and the state. This structure is central to the allocation and control of capital, ensuring all forms of capital distribution and entitlement.
*The '''government-organization complex''' is the institutional arrangement to protect the individual from the state, and to prevent those in power from changing the formative context. It establishes a link between safeguards of freedom and the dispersion of powers, e.g. partisan rivalries fail to extend to debates over the fundamental institutions that affect social interactions.
*The '''occupational-structure complex''' is a social division of labor characterized by a lack of caste or religious division. It is based on material reward and task defining jobs receiving the highest pay.

==Influences in other fields==
The thesis of formative contexts has been heavily drawn on and used within the [[Social Study of Information Systems]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In the field of [[Information systems]] [[Claudio Ciborra]] and Giovan Lanzara define the term "formative context" as the "set of institutional arrangements and cognitive imageries that inform actors' practical and reasoning routines in organisations". They posit that the common inability to inquire into, challenge or shape formative context can inhibit individuals and organizations from acting competently and learning what they need to know in order to make the most of situations and technological transitions as the enchaining effect of Formative Context can lead to cognitive and social inertia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7011">'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly, of the [[British Empire]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]], the most influential of the [[Four Policemen]] victorious in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] may take over the role&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"&gt;[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as it reaches out to protect [[shipping lanes]], protect its overseas workers, and 'creeps into the superpower league'. The [[Western world|West]], according to two columnists of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', 'should view this as an opportunity, not a threat.'&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"/&gt;

==In international law==

No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; '[[par in parem non habet imperium]]', no authority between equals, is the principle applied. In reality, international law is decentralised, unpoliced, unenforceable, unclear and frequently broken. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with state policing==

Within states, law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13th July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The comparatively peaceful years 1815–1914 came to be known as [[Pax Britannica]]. The UK made efforts to control the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&gt;pdf&gt;britain-and-the-trade.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sebastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914–1945 no one state was hegemonic. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[The Daily Bell]], 19/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,&lt;/ref&gt; But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, serious doubts have been raised about the validity of US overseas intervention and destabilization in Iraq, Libya and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]], 'America's selective vigilantism will make as many enemies as friends', [[The Guardian]], 6/9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Gardels]] and [[Hans Blix]], 'America is not the world's policeman - in Syria or Iraq', [[Christian Science Monitor]], 27/8/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Americans accept no law other than their own on US soil, yet expect other nations to submit to the rule of US troops; a [[double standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the World Police Analogy gets wrong', [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[drone strikes]] on terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan goes against the presumption of innocence. The CIA, exempt from the [[Geneva Convention]], is 'secretly sentencing people to death for an unproven crime, without trial or inquest.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Robertson]], 'Drone attacks go against every Human Right in the book', [[New Statesman]], 13/6/2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] is not a state, so 'war law' which permits killing of combatants, does not apply.

The '''governmental learning spiral''' is a technique used to solve specific governance challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Blindenbacher and Watts 2003, pp. 19–20; Blindenbacher and Saunders 2005, p. 4; Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, p. 15, p.178&lt;/ref&gt; It is used during prearranged educational events such as [[Academic conference|conferences]], [[e-learning]], and trainings to improve performance in [[democratic governance]].&lt;ref&gt;March and Olsen. 1995; Doornbos, 2003. p. 3–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finer 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The governmental learning spiral—a [[heuristic]] and [[multidisciplinary]] tool—has been developed and implemented at international governmental learning events throughout the past decade.

==Concept==
The technique consists of a nine-stage [[learning process]] divided into three phases, which include the planning and aftermath as well as the learning event itself.

A major characteristic of this type of governmental learning event is [[Facilitation (business)|facilitation]] by a ''learning broker''&lt;ref&gt;Rose 1991 pp. 3–30; Dolowitz and Marsh 2000. p. 9. Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt; who oversees all aspects of event organization. These include logistics, content preparation, drafting and implementation of the agenda, moderation of the learning sessions, and follow-up activities. The learning broker designs the learning process according to the specific governance challenge at hand.

The event must be structured based on several factors:
* The specific challenge a government is facing
* An analysis of the kind of knowledge a government needs to address it
* The particular political and institutional environment, which determines who will participate in the activity&lt;ref&gt;Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 84–88&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants invited to the event must represent different substantive and organizational perspectives and play a precisely defined role as both knowledge holders and knowledge seekers. When this is achieved, participants have unlimited access to the collective wealth of the shared [[tacit]] and [[explicit knowledge]].

The effects of applying the governmental learning spiral technique are threefold: The primary effect is that governments gain access to the latest knowledge in democratic governance, which they can then apply to specific governance challenges with concrete, practical action. A second effect is that—because of the iterative character of the learning process—the knowledge being learned is always validated and updated in real time to include the latest experiences on the subject. A third effect is that participation in the learning process evokes a sense of social belonging among the learning actors, which often leads to the creation of [[business networking|networks]] and [[communities of practice]] where governments continue to share their latest experiences and by doing so launch the next spin of the Governmental Learning Spiral.

==Template==
The governmental learning spiral technique consists of a nine-stage template.&lt;ref&gt;Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 69–73&lt;/ref&gt; The stages of the learning process are organized chronologically in the template and split into three distinct sequences for a particular learning event.

1. Before (framing phase): The ''conceptualization'', ''triangulation'', and ''accommodation'' stages are the preparatory stages, where the specific governance challenge is defined, existing knowledge on the topic is framed, participants are selected and inivited, and trust is established between the learning actors and the event facilitator and between participants and the learning process itself.

2. During (reflection phase): The ''internalization'', ''externalization'', ''reconceptualization'', and ''transformation'' stages represent the core of the educational process, where learning actors review and adapt new knowledge according to their personal needs. Thereafter the actors change their individual and organizational thinking and behavior in an elaborate inter- and intrapersonal procedure.

3. After (projection phase): The follow-up to the learning activity occurs in the ''configuration'' stage, where all the knowledge acquired during the event is made available and accessible to everyone involved in the event as well as to a wider audience. This new knowledge further serves in the final ''iteration'' stage as a frame for the next spin of the governmental learning spiral, as well as a [[feedback loop]] in the context of a new learning system.

Because knowledge in [[governance]] has a short half-life and has to be updated constantly, the learning process itself must also be ongoing. This iterative procedure, where knowledge is constantly reviewed, renewed, and transformed into political action in a real-time, multi-turn process, can be illustrated as a spiral. Each of the nine stages of the learning process is bound together by a "spin," which ends with the last iteration stage and restarts the next spin with its first configuration stage.

'''Governmentality''' is a concept first developed by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]] in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the [[Collège de France]] during this time.

The concept has been elaborated further from an "Anglo-Neo Foucauldian" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, [[Nikolas Rose]], and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as:
* the way [[government]]s try to produce the citizen best suited to fulfill those governments' policies
* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Susan (ed) ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmentality may also be understood as:
* the "art of government"&lt;ref name="burchell1"&gt;{{cite book|title='Governmentality', trans. Rosi Braidotti and revised by Colin Gordon, in Graham Burchell, Colin Gordon and Peter Miller (eds) ''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality'', pp.&amp;nbsp;87–104.|author=Foucault, M.|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "how" of governing (that is, the calculated means of directing how we behave and act)&lt;ref name="Jeffreys"&gt;[Jeffreys and Sigley (2009) 'Governmentality, Governance and China' in China's Governmentalities,  (ed.) Elaine Jeffreys, {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "governmental rationality"&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;{{cite book|title='Governmental rationality: an introduction', in Graham Burchell, Colin Gordon and Peter Miller (eds) ''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1–48.|author=Gordon, C|year=1991|publisher=Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "a 'guideline' for the analysis that Michel Foucault offers by way of historical reconstructions embracing a period starting from Ancient Greece right through to modernity and neo-liberalism"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, '''The Government of Self and Others: Lectures at the Collège de France 1982-1983''' (2010) http://rauli.cbs.dk/index.php/foucault-studies/article/view/3127/3298.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault '''The Courage of Truth : Lectures at the Collège de France 1983-1984''' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault '''The Birth of Biopolitics Lectures At The College de France 1978-1979''' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "the techniques and strategies by which a society is rendered governable"&lt;ref&gt;'''Foucault, Governmentality, and Critique'''(2002) {{cite web |url=http://www.andosciasociology.net/resources/Foucault$2C+Governmentality$2C+and+Critique+IV-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724102830/http://www.andosciasociology.net/resources/Foucault$2C+Governmentality$2C+and+Critique+IV-2.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 'reasoned way of governing best and, at the same time, reflection on the best possible way of governing'&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M., (2008), ''The birth of biopolitics. Lectures at the College de France, 1978‐79. Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantics==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the "...linking of governing ("gouverner") and modes of thought ("mentalité")".&lt;ref name="lemke2"&gt;{{cite book|title='The birth of bio-politics: Michael Foucault's lectures at the College de France on neo-liberal governmentality' in ''Economy and Society'' v.30, i.2, p.&amp;nbsp;190-207|author=Lemke, T|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was not coined by uniting words "gouvernement" and "mentalité", but simply by making ''gouvernement'' into ''gouvernementalité'' just like ''musical'' into ''musicalité'' [i.e. government + -al- ''adjective'' + -ité ''abstract noun''] (see Michel Senellart's "Course Context" in Foucault's "Security, territory, population" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of "governing" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 90&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, "...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for our purposes, government is "...the conduct of conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault in Burchell, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==

In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the "art of government" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of "government" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the "biopolitical" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as [[biopower|biopolitics]] and [[power-knowledge]]. The [[genealogy|genealogical]] exploration of the modern state as "problem of government" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.&lt;ref name="mallette"&gt;{{cite book|title=La "gouvernementalité" chez Michel Foucault. M. A., Faculté de Philosophie|author=Malette S.|year=2006|publisher=Université Laval - Québec|url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2006/23836/23836.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "governmentality" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

"Governmentality" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to "neoliberal governmentality", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in [[neoliberalism]]. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (''"savoir"'' in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:
{{quote|
"1. The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target population, as its principal form of knowledge political economy, and as its essential technical means apparatuses of security.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs.&lt;br /&gt;

3. The process, or rather the result of the process, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the administrative state during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'."&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"&gt;Burchell, Gordon and Miller, 1991: 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its "apparatuses of security," that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting "political economy," and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, "economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods".&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault's definition (the "resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs"&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"/&gt;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early [[Renaissance]] state, which became more concerned with the "disposing of things",&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to "render a society governable".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"&lt;ref name=B102&gt;Burchell, 102&lt;/ref&gt;), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"&lt;ref name=B102/&gt;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's [[ethical]], [[political]] and [[historical]] thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled "Security, territory and population" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on "The Birth of Biopolitics" at the [[Collège de France]] in 1978-1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as ''Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)'' (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on [[neoliberalism]] and the "Rule of Law", the "microphysics of power" and also on what Foucault called [[biopower|biopolitics]]. In the second and third volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', namely, ''The Use of Pleasure'' (1984) and ''The Care of the Self'' (1984), and in his lecture on "Technologies of the Self" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between [[subjectivation]] and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including "The Birth of Biopolitics" (1979), "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" (1979), "The Subject and Power" (1982) and "What is Enlightenment?" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary [[social order]]s, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of "governmentality".

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with [[governance]]) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book ''The Foucault Effect'' (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on ''"gouvernementalité"''.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work ''Foucault and Law'' [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, "governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '–ity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences" [1994:77].

Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of "governmental rationality" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not "a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a "collective activity" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually "examined by those who inhabit it" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in "can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects "technologies of power" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any "conduct of conduct" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood "from within its own perspective" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes "a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic [[Cartography|mapping]] has historically been a key strategy of governmentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose-Redwood|first=R.B.|title=Governmentality, Geography, and the Geo-Coded World|journal=Progress in Human Geography.|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=469–486|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph619oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brian Harley|Harley]],&lt;ref name ="Harley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B.|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica |year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], affirms that [[Sovereign state|State]]-produced maps "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s concept of a [[panopticon]], in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.&lt;ref name="Hannah 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=M.G|title=Governmentality and the Mastery of Territory in Nineteenth-Century America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of [[neoliberalism]], the State has "hollowed out" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical [[scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=B|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing Out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial [[governance]] than traditional [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] State-distribution of cartographic knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Crampton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping Without a Net|journal=Paper Presented as Part of Virtual Seminar in GIScience and Technology|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus subverting Harley's&lt;ref name=Harley /&gt; theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful.

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and [[autonomy]]. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of [[political power]], but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those "technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
[[Technologies of the self]] refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
[[Healthism]] links the "public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather "individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalisation]]. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of [[shame]]. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:273&lt;/ref&gt; The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2001:202&lt;/ref&gt; These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for "evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so".&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:234&lt;/ref&gt; By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:86&lt;/ref&gt; We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:87&lt;/ref&gt; If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism.  Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
[[Ecogovernmentality]] (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[Government agency|government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct "The Environment." This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of Governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, "liberal art of government" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of [[risk society|risk]] or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

1. Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding "degeneration."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's [[Panopticon]] surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices "irregularities."&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply "counterweighted" by it.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the [[Keynesian]] [[welfare state]] under [[F.D. Roosevelt]], the thought of the German liberals in the [[Freiburg school]], and the thought of American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists such as the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]] which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a "legal strait-jacket" for the state,&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"/&gt; and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application to health care ===

Recent research by [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The courage of truth (the government of self and others II) : lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK|isbn=9781403986689 |author2=Ewald, François |author3=Burchell, Alessandro Fontana |editor=Arnold I.

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009)  highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. &amp; Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts.

'''Holism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'' "all, whole, entire") is the idea that [[system]]s (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic) and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not just as a collection of parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Barry | last = Oshry | title = Seeing Systems: Unlocking the Mysteries of Organizational Life | publisher = Berrett-Koehler | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sunny Y | last = Auyang | title = Foundations of Complex-system Theories: in Economics, Evolutionary Biology, and Statistical Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term holism was coined by [[Jan_Smuts|Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref name="HaE"&gt;{{ cite book | first = Jan Christiaan | last = Smuts | title = Holism and Evolution 2nd Edition |publisher = Macmillan and Co | year = 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first publication of ''Holism and Evolution'' was by Macmillan and Co. in 1926. Smuts published a 2nd edition in 1927 and there have been at least three subsequent reprints; Compass/Viking Press 1961, Greenwood Press 1973, and Sierra Sunrise Books 1999 (a version edited by Sanford Holst). The full text of the 1927 2nd edition is available on the Internet Archive site, and this is the source used in updating the Holism page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Adler]] considered holism as a concept that represents all of the wholes in the universe, and these wholes are the real factors in the universe. Further, that Holism also denoted a theory of the universe in the same vein as Materialism and Spiritualism.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

== Synopsis of ''Holism and Evolution'' ==
After identifying the need for reform in the fundamental concepts of matter, life and mind (chapter 1) Smuts examines the reformed concepts (as of 1926) of space and time (chapter 2), matter (chapter 3) and biology (chapter 4) and concludes that the close approach to each other of the concepts of matter, life and mind, and the partial overflow of each other's domain, imply that there is a fundamental principle (Holism) of which they are the progressive outcome.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|86}}  Chapters 5 and 6 provide the general concept, functions and categories of Holism; chapters 7 and 8 address Holism with respect to Mechanism and Darwinism, chapters 9-11 make a start towards demonstrating the concepts and functions of Holism for the metaphysical categories (mind, personality, ideals) and the book concludes with a chapter that argues for the universal ubiquity of Holism and its place as a monistic ontology.

The following is an overview of Smuts' opinions regarding the general concept, functions, and categories of Holism; like the definition of Holism, other than the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, the editor is unaware of any authoritative secondary sources corroborating Smuts' opinions.

=== Structure ===
Wholes are composites which have an internal structure, function or character which clearly differentiate them from mechanical additions, aggregates, and constructions, such as science assumes on the mechanical hypothesis.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|106}} The concept of structure is not confined to the physical domain (e.g. chemical, biological and artifacts);  it also applies to the metaphysical domain (e.g. mental structures, properties, attributes, values, ideals, etc.)&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|161}}

=== Field ===
The field of a whole is not something different and additional to it, it is the continuation of the whole beyond its sensible contours of experience.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|113}}  The field characterizes a whole as a unified and synthesised event in the system of Relativity, that includes not only its present but also its past—and also its future potentialities.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|89}}  As such, the concept of field entails both activity and structure.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|115}}

=== Variation ===

Darwin's theory of organic descent placed primary emphasis on the role of natural selection, but there would be nothing to select if not for variation.  Variations that are the result of mutations in the biological sense and variations that are the result of individually acquired modifications in the personal sense are attributed by Smuts to Holism; further it was his opinion that because variations appear in complexes and not singly, evolution is more than the outcome of individual selections; it is holistic.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|190–192}}

=== Regulation ===

The whole exhibits a discernible regulatory function as it relates to cooperation and coordination of the structure and activity of parts, and to the selection and deselection of variations. The result is a balanced correlation of organs and functions. The activities of the parts are directed to central ends; co-operation and unified action instead of the separate mechanical activities of the parts.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|125}}

=== Creativity ===
It is the intermingling of fields which is creative or causal in nature.  This is seen in matter, where if not for its dynamic structural creative character matter could not have been the mother of the universe.  This function, or factor of creativity is even more marked in biology where the protoplasm of the cell is vitally active in an ongoing process of creative change where parts are continually being destroyed and replaced by new protoplasm. With minds the regulatory function of Holism acquires consciousness and freedom, demonstrating a creative power of the most far-reaching character. Holism is not only creative but self-creative, and its final structures are far more holistic than its initial structures.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|18, 37, 67–68, 88–89 }}

=== Causality ===
As it relates to causality Smuts makes reference to [[A. N. Whitehead]], and indirectly [[Baruch Spinoza]]; the Whitehead premise is that organic mechanism is a fundamental process which realizes and actualizes individual syntheses or unities.  Holism (the factor) exemplifies this same idea while emphasizing the holistic character of the process.  The whole completely transforms the concept of Causality; results are not directly a function of causes. The whole absorbs and integrates the cause into its own activity; results appear as the consequence of the activity of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|121–124,126}}  Note that this material relating to Whitehead's influence as it relates to causality was added in the second edition, and of course will not be found in reprints of the first edition; nor is it included in the most recent Holst edition.  It is the second edition of ''Holism and Evolution'' (1927) that provides the most recent and definitive treatment by Smuts.

=== The whole is greater than the sum of its parts ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental holistic characters as a unity of parts which is so close and intense as to be more than the sum of its parts; which not only gives a particular conformation or structure to the parts, but so relates and determines them in their synthesis that their functions are altered;  the synthesis affects and determines the parts, so that they function towards the whole; and the whole and the parts, therefore reciprocally influence and determine each other, and appear more or less to merge their individual characters: the whole is in the parts and the parts are in the whole, and this synthesis of whole and parts is reflected in the holistic character of the functions of the parts as well as of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Progressive grading of wholes ===
A "rough and provisional" summary of the progressive grading of wholes that comprise holism is as follows:&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|109}}

# Material structure e.g. a chemical compound
# Functional structure in living bodies 
# Animals, which exhibit a degree of central control that is primarily implicit and unconscious
# Personality, characterized as conscious central control
# States and similar group organizations characterized by central control that involve many people 
# Holistic Ideals, or absolute Values, distinct from human personality that are creative factors in the creation of a spiritual world, for example Truth, Beauty and Goodness.

==Holism in philosophy==
{{main|Confirmation holism|Semantic holism}}
In philosophy, any doctrine that emphasizes the priority of a whole over its parts is holism. Some suggest that such a definition owes its origins to a non-holistic view of language and places it in the reductivist camp. Alternately, a 'holistic' definition of holism denies the necessity of a division between the function of separate parts and the workings of the 'whole'. Effectively this means that the concept of a part has no absolute foundation in observation, but is rather a result of a materialist structuring of reality based on the necessity of logical and distinct units as a means to deriving information through comparative analysis. It suggests that the key recognizable characteristic of a concept of 'true' holism is a sense of the fundamental truth of any particular experience. This exists in contradistinction to what is perceived as the reductivist reliance on inductive method as the key to verification of its concept of how the parts function within the whole. Equally the potential for recognising the clarity of holistic experience within the logical terms of maths is limited by the abstract nature of numbers. In terms of real life measurements numbers have no scale or dimensional properties, so they have to rely on experimentally verified units (e.g. inches, volts, calories etc.), to describe reality. It is this reliance on the holistic integrity of experience which leads to the recognition that intuitive perception rather than mathematical calculation is the source of the truth of effective theories.  (See references Holism, 2016.)

=== Philosophy of language ===
In the [[philosophy of language]] this becomes the claim, called [[semantic holism]], that the meaning of an individual word or sentence can only be understood in terms of its relations to a larger body of language, even a whole theory or a whole language. In the [[philosophy of mind]], a mental state may be identified only in terms of its relations with others. This is often referred to as "content holism" or "holism of the mental". This notion involves the philosophies of such figures as [[Frege]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_holism.html ''Holism'', The Basics of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and confirmation holism ===
[[epistemological holism|Epistemological]] and [[confirmation holism]] are mainstream ideas in contemporary philosophy.

=== Ontological holism ===
Ontological holism was espoused by [[David Bohm]] in his theory&lt;ref&gt;Bohm, D. (1980). ''Wholeness and the Implicate Order''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7100-0971-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[implicate and explicate order]].

=== Spinoza ===
The concept of holism played a pivotal role in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Huenemann, ''Interpreting Spinoza: Critical Essays'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eccy De Jonge, ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'', UK: Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
Hegel rejected "the fundamentally atomistic conception of the object," (Stern, 38) arguing that "individual objects exist as manifestations of indivisible substance-universals, which cannot be reduced to a set of properties or attributes; he therefore holds that the object should be treated as an ontologically primary whole." (Stern, 40) In direct opposition to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], therefore, "Hegel insists that the unity we find in our experience of the world is not constructed by us out of a plurality of intuitions." (Stern, 40) In "his ontological scheme a concrete individual is not reducible to a plurality of sensible properties, but rather exemplifies a substance universal." (Stern, 41) His point is that it is "a mistake to treat an organic substance like blood as nothing more than a compound of unchanging chemical elements, that can be separated and united without being fundamentally altered." (Stern, 103) In Hegel's view, a substance like blood is thus "more of an organic unity and cannot be understood as just an external composition of the sort of distinct substances that were discussed at the level of chemistry." (Stern, 103) Thus in Hegel's view, blood is blood and cannot be successfully reduced to what we consider are its component parts; we must view it as a whole substance entire unto itself. This is most certainly a fundamentally holistic view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge Chapman Hall, 1990 (full text download)] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160520122904/http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf |date=2016-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- [Editors note: work in progress, moving references to Hegel to a common section] [[Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;6 &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merold Westphal, ''Hegel, Freedom, and Modernity'', New York: SUNY, 1992, pp.79-81, &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Esfield, ''Holism in Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Physics'', Springer, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Maria Tito, ''Logic in the Husserlian Context'', Northwestern University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;245&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Holism in physical sciences==
{{main |Holism in science}}

=== Agriculture ===
There are several newer methods in [[agricultural science]] such as [[permaculture]] and holistic planned grazing ([[holistic management]]) that integrate [[ecology]] and [[social sciences]] with food production. [[Organic farming]] is sometimes considered a holistic approach.

=== Chaos and complexity ===
In the latter half of the 20th century, holism led to [[systems thinking]] and its derivatives. Systems in biology, psychology, or sociology are frequently so complex that their behavior is, or appears, "new" or "[[emergence|emergent]]": it cannot be deduced from the properties of the elements alone.{{Sfn | von Bertalanffy | 1971 | p = 54}}

Holism has thus been used as a catchword. This contributed to the resistance encountered by the scientific interpretation of holism, which insists that there are [[ontology|ontological]] reasons that prevent reductive models in principle from providing efficient algorithms for prediction of system behavior in certain classes of systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Scientific holism holds that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior, and it is suspected that behavior of such systems might be [[computational irreducibility|computationally irreducible]], which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system state without a full simulation of all the events occurring in the system. Key properties of the higher level behavior of certain classes of systems may be mediated by rare "surprises" in the behavior of their elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, thus evading predictions except by brute force simulation.

[[Complex systems|Complexity theory]] (also called "science of complexity") is a contemporary heir of systems thinking. It comprises both computational and holistic, relational approaches towards understanding [[complex adaptive systems]], and especially in the latter, some argue that it can be seen as the polar opposite to reductive methods. General theories of complexity have been proposed, and numerous complexity institutes and departments have sprung up around the world. The [[Santa Fe Institute]] is arguably the most famous of them.

=== Ecology ===
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Earth seen from [[Apollo 17]]]]

Holistic thinking is often applied to ecology, combining biological, chemical, physical, economic, ethical, and political insights. The complexity grows with the area, so that it is necessary to reduce the characteristic of the view in other ways, for example to a specific time of duration.

[[John Muir]], Scots-born early American conservationist,&lt;ref&gt;Reconnecting with John Muir By Terry Gifford, University of Georgia, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "When we try to pick out anything by itself we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe".

More information is to be found in the field of [[systems ecology]], a cross-disciplinary field influenced by [[general systems theory]].

=== Medicine ===
In [[primary care]] the term "holistic," has been used to describe approaches that take into account social considerations and other intuitive judgements.&lt;ref name="TudorHart2010"&gt;[[Julian Tudor Hart]] (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_6-NeAqcsC&amp;pg=PA258 ''The Political Economy of Health Care''] pp.106, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The term holism, and so-called approaches, appear in [[psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] medicine in the 1970s, when they were considered one possible way to conceptualize psychosomatic phenomena. Instead of charting one-way causal links from [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] to [[Soma (biology)|soma]], or vice versa, it aimed at a systemic model, where multiple biological, psychological and social factors were seen as interlinked.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"/&gt;

Other, alternative approaches in the 1970s were psychosomatic and somatopsychic approaches, which concentrated on causal links only from psyche to soma, or from soma to psyche, respectively.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"&gt;Lipowski, 1977.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present it is commonplace in psychosomatic medicine to state that psyche and soma cannot really be separated for practical or theoretical purposes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A disturbance on any level—somatic, psychic, or social—will radiate to all the other levels, too. In this sense, psychosomatic thinking is similar to the [[biopsychosocial model]] of medicine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Many [[alternative medicine]] practitioners claim a [[Holistic health|holistic approach to healing]].

=== Neurology ===
A lively debate has run since the end of the 19th century regarding the functional organization of the [[brain]]. The holistic tradition (e.g., [[Pierre Marie]]) maintained that the brain was a homogeneous organ with no specific subparts whereas the localizationists (e.g., [[Paul Broca]]) argued that the brain was organized in functionally distinct [[cortical area]]s which were each specialized to process a given type of information or implement specific mental operations. The controversy was [[epitome|epitomized]] with the existence of a [[language]] area in the brain, nowadays known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref&gt;'Does Broca's area exist?': Christofredo Jakob's 1906 response to Pierre Marie's holistic stance. Kyrana Tsapkini, Ana B. Vivas, Lazaros C. Triarhou. ''Brain and Language'', Volume 105, Issue 3, June 2008, Pages 211-219 {{DOI|10.1016/j.bandl.2007.07.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holism in social sciences==

=== Architecture ===
Architecture is often argued by design academics and those practicing in design to be a holistic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this context, holism tends to imply an all-inclusive design perspective. This trait is considered exclusive to architecture, distinct from other professions involved in design projects.

=== Branding ===
A holistic brand (also holistic branding) is considering the entire brand or image of the company. For example, a universal brand image across all countries, including everything from advertising styles to the stationery the company has made, to the company colours.

=== Economics ===
With roots in [[Schumpeter]], the evolutionary approach might be considered the holistic theory in economics. It shares certain language from the biological evolutionary approach. It takes into account how the [[innovation system]] evolves over time. Knowledge and know-how, know-who, know-what and know-why are part of the whole business economics. Knowledge can also be tacit, as described by [[Michael Polanyi]]. These models are open, and consider that it is hard to predict exactly the impact of a policy measure. They are also less mathematical.

=== Education reform ===
The [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]] identifies many levels of cognitive functioning, which can be used to create a more [[holistic education]]. In [[authentic assessment]], rather than using computers to score multiple choice tests, a [[standards based assessment]] uses trained scorers to score open-response items using holistic scoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;Rubrics (Authentic Assessment Toolbox) "So, when might you use a holistic rubric? Holistic rubrics tend to be used when a quick or gross judgment needs to be made." [http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/rubrics.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In projects such as the North Carolina Writing Project, scorers are instructed not to count errors, or count numbers of points or supporting statements. The scorer is instead instructed to judge holistically whether "as a whole" is it more a "2" or a "3". Critics question whether such a process can be as objective as computer scoring, and the degree to which such scoring methods can result in different scores from different scorers.

===Psychology===

==== Psychology of perception ====
A major holistic movement in the early twentieth century was [[gestalt psychology]]. The claim was that perception is not an aggregation of atomic [[sense data]] but a field, in which there is a figure and a ground. Background has holistic effects on the perceived figure. Gestalt psychologists included [[Wolfgang Koehler]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Kurt Koffka]]. Koehler claimed the perceptual fields corresponded to electrical fields in the brain. [[Karl Lashley]] did experiments with gold foil pieces inserted in monkey brains purporting to show that such fields did not exist. However, many of the perceptual illusions and visual phenomena exhibited by the gestaltists were taken over (often without credit) by later perceptual psychologists. Gestalt psychology had influence on [[Fritz Perls]]' [[gestalt therapy]], although some old-line gestaltists opposed the association with counter-cultural and [[New Age]] trends later associated with gestalt therapy. Gestalt theory was also influential on phenomenology. [[Aron Gurwitsch]] wrote on the role of the field of consciousness in gestalt theory in relation to phenomenology. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] made much use of holistic psychologists such as work of [[Kurt Goldstein]] in his ''Phenomenology of Perception''.

==== Teleological psychology ====
[[Alfred Adler]] believed that the individual (an integrated whole expressed through a self-consistent unity of thinking, feeling, and action, moving toward an unconscious, [[Classical Adlerian psychology#Fictional final goal|fictional final goal]]), must be understood within the larger wholes of society, from the groups to which he belongs (starting with his face-to-face relationships), to the larger whole of mankind. The recognition of our social embeddedness and the need for developing an interest in the welfare of others, as well as a respect for nature, is at the heart of Adler's philosophy of living and principles of psychotherapy.

[[Edgar Morin]], the French philosopher and sociologist, can be considered a holist based on the [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] nature of his work.

Mel Levine, M.D., author of ''A Mind at a Time'',&lt;ref&gt;(Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder (with Charles R. Schwab) of the not-for-profit organization All Kinds of Minds, can be considered a holist based on his view of the 'whole child' as a product of many systems and his work supporting the educational needs of children through the management of a child's educational profile as a whole rather than isolated weaknesses in that profile.

=== Anthropology ===
There is an ongoing dispute as to whether anthropology is intrinsically holistic. Supporters of this concept consider anthropology holistic in two senses. First, it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, psychological, etc.)  Further, many academic programs following this approach take a "four-field" approach to anthropology that encompasses [[physical anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]] or [[social anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shore | first = Bradd | year = 1999 | title = Strange Fate of Holism | journal = Anthropology News | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 4–5 | doi = 10.1111/an.1999.40.9.5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leading anthropologists disagree, and consider anthropological holism to be an artifact from 19th century [[sociocultural evolution|social evolutionary]] thought that inappropriately imposes scientific [[positivism]] upon cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=Sacred_bundle&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last =Segal | editor1-first = Daniel A | first2 = Ian | editor2-last = Yanagisako | first1 = James | last1 = Clifford | last2 = Hodder | first3 = Rena | last3 = Lederman | first4 = Michael | last4 = Silverstein |title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology |publisher=Duke University Press |year= 2005 |url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/cgibin/forwardsql/search.cgi?template0=nomatch.htm&amp;template2=books/book_detail_page.htm&amp;user_id=11016434335&amp;Bmain.Btitle_option=1&amp;Bmain.Btitle=Unwrapping+the+Sacred+Bundle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "holism" is additionally used within social and cultural anthropology to refer to an analysis of a society as a whole which refuses to break society into component parts. One definition says: "as a methodological ideal, holism implies ... that one does not permit oneself to believe that our own established institutional boundaries (e.g. between politics, sexuality, religion, economics) necessarily may be found also in foreign societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/holism.htm anthrobase definition of holism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Émile Durkheim ====
{{main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}} {{see also|Ubuntu (philosophy)}}
[[Émile Durkheim]] developed a concept of holism which he set as opposite to the notion that a [[society]] was nothing more than a simple collection of individuals. In more recent times, [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; has contrasted "holism" to "[[individualism]]" as two different forms of societies. According to him, modern humans live in an individualist society, whereas ancient Greek society, for example, could be qualified as "holistic", because the individual found identity in the whole society. Thus, the individual was ready to sacrifice himself or herself for his or her [[community]], as his or her life without the ''[[polis]]'' had no sense whatsoever.

==== Cosmomorphism ====
The French Protestant missionary [[Maurice Leenhardt]] coined the term "cosmomorphism" to indicate the state of perfect [[symbiosis]] with the surrounding environment which characterized the culture of the [[Melanesians]] of [[New Caledonia]]. For these people, an isolated individual is totally indeterminate, indistinct, and featureless until he can find his position within the natural and social world in which he is inserted. The confines between the self and the world are annulled to the point that the material body itself is no guarantee of the sort of recognition of identity which is typical of our own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Bihan, [http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/paroles/bihan_writer.html "The Writer, a Man Without Qualities"], ''Literature and Identity in New Caledonia''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rasmussen, [http://ijds.lemoyne.edu/journal/3_1/pdf/IJDS.3.1.03.Rasmussen.pdf "Personahood, Self, Difference, and Dialogue (Commentary on Chaudhary)"], ''International Journal for Dialogical Science'', Fall 2008, Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;1, 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Holistic concepts are strongly represented within the thoughts expressed within [[Logos]] (per [[Heraclitus]]), [[Panentheism]] and [[Pantheism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[theological anthropology]], which belongs to theology and not to anthropology, holism is the belief that [[Human body|body]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]] are not separate components of a person, but rather facets of a united whole.&lt;ref&gt;"The traditional anthropology encounters major problems in the Bible and its predominantly holistic view of human beings. Genesis 2:7 is a key verse: 'Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being' (NRSV). The 'living being' (traditionally, 'living soul') is an attempt to translate the Hebrew ''nephesh hayah'', which indicates a 'living person' in the context. More than one interpreter has pointed out that this text does not say that the human being ''has'' a soul but rather ''is'' a soul. H. Wheeler Robinson summarized the matter in his statement that 'The Hebrew conceived man as animated body and not as an incarnate soul.'" (Martin E. Tate, "The Comprehensive Nature of Salvation in Biblical Perspective," ''Evangelical review of theology'', Vol. 23.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mappa di Eratostene.jpg|thumb|250px|The Hellenistic world where Alexander tried to rule his new Empire through the concept of Homonoia]]
'''Homonoia''' ({{lang-gr|Ὁμόνοια}}) is the concept of order and unity, ''being of one mind together''&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"&gt;[[#refMauriac1949|Mauriac 1949]], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Tarn p. 400"&gt;[[#refTarn2002|Tarn 2002]], p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''union of hearts''.&lt;ref name="theosociety.org"&gt;{{cite web |date= October 1974 |url = http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sunrise/24-74-5/br-gfk2.htm |title = Of One Mind, of One Heart |work= [[Sunrise (magazine)|Sunrise Magazine]] |publisher = theosociety.org | accessdate = October 13, 2009 | last=Knoche, Grace F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by the Greeks to create unity in the politics of classical Greece.  It saw widespread use when [[Alexander the Great]] adopted its principles to govern his [[King of Asia|vast Empire]].

==Interpretation==

===Classical Greeks===
The concept of Homonoia was an ancient Greek concept which traditionally was not applied beyond their own culture.  The Greeks viewed Homonoia as an absence of factional fighting in their city states.&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"/&gt; The Greeks viewed outside cultures as "barbarians".  The famed scholar [[Aristotle]] once told his student, a young Alexander the Great, "treat Greeks as friends, but [non-Greeks] as animals."&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"/&gt;

It was the scholar [[Isocrates]] who first looked beyond the Greek people.  While he didn't preach that the savages of the non-Greek world could be on par with the superior Greek people, he did believe they could be made Greek and thus be ''of one mind together''.  He claimed that Greekness could become a matter of nurture rather than nature.&lt;ref name= "Low p. 62"&gt;[[#refLow2007|Low 2007]], p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time spent in the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]] that Isocrates was able to teach the concept to an influential audience.  Philip II took much of the concept to heart, but he too viewed it as a method reserved for the Greeks. He used the concept as his driving force behind creating the [[League of Corinth|Corinthian League]], an alliance to unite the Greek States for a war against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].  After Philip II was [[assassinated]] his son Alexander the Great became King of Macedonia and himself became a proponent of Homonoia.

===Alexander the Great===

Alexander's tutor, Aristotle, viewed non-Greeks as barbarian animals.&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"/&gt; Alexander however, ignored his teacher's indication and expanded on the concept of Homonoia.  With an Empire covering most of the known world, Alexander sought to rule his subjects, whether they were Greek, Persian or Egyptian, under the concept of Homonoia.&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"/&gt; In his short time as ruler of his vast Empire he tried to adopt customs of the cultures he conquered such as Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of ''[[proskynesis]]'', either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians paid to their social superiors.&lt;ref name= "Arrian VII, 11"&gt;[[#refArrian1983|Arrian 1983]], VII, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He also married the officers of his army to Persian wives in an effort to further create a sense of oneness in his new Empire.&lt;ref name= "Tetlow p. 171"&gt;[[#refTetlow2005|Tetlow 2005]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his policies he wanted to create a new Greco-Oriental empire as distinct from the more traditional system of a small ruling class of conquerors ruling over the recently vanquished.  It was his practice to place the old style Persian satrap as governors but in the newly created offices of taxation and finance he placed Macedonians.&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 108"&gt;[[#refMauriac1949|Mauriac 1949]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death most of his reforms lived on even as the Empire fragmented into [[Diadochi|successor states]].

===In the Romanized East===
''Homonoia'' was extended under Roman rule in the highly urbanized East as a symbolic mechanism for dealing with intra-city tensions and for linking the sometimes intensely individual eastern city-states.&lt;ref name= "Price pp. 126-32"&gt;{{harvnb|Price|1985| pp=126–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''temple of Homonoia'' at [[Aphrodisias]] in Caria appears as the setting for the wedding of Callirhoe and Dionysios in the first-century CE romance ''[[Chariton|Chaereas and Callirhoe]]''; the temple is objectified in coinage of Aphrodisias that shows the [[cult statue]] of Aphrodite of Aphrodisias with those of other cities, under the legend ''homonoia'': "Deities in the coin issues served as symbols that mediated the power within regional alliances, bolstered the prestige of the divine realm in human activity and provided the glue that bound together the political and the cosmic spheres."&lt;ref name= "Edwards p. 709"&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|1994|p=709}} and bibliography&lt;br/&gt;Edwards notes several examples of ''homonoia'' coinage.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first century CE, the Greek [[rhetor]] [[Dio Chrysostom]] sought in one of his ''Discourses'' to establish ''homonoia'' between two cities that each claimed the sobriquet "first city", [[Nicaea]] and [[Nicopolis]].&lt;ref name= "Chrysostom 28.22"&gt;[[#refChrysostom1939|Chrysostom 1939]], 28.22&lt;/ref&gt;

{{voting}}

The term '''issue voting''' describes when [[Voting|voters]] cast their vote in [[election]]s based on [[political issue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of an election, issues include "any questions of [[public policy]] which have been or are a matter of controversy and are sources of disagreement between [[political party|political parties]].”&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of issue voting, voters compare  the [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|candidates']] respective [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] against their own in order to decide for whom to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A voter does not need to have an in-depth understanding of every issue and knowledge of how a [[candidate]] stands on every issue, but rather a sense of which candidate they agree with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Voters use many different tactics to rationalize their view on a particular issue. Some people look at what has happened in the past and predict how they think a particular issue will affect them in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue voting is often contrasted with party voting. A 2010 [[University of California, Davis]] study found that voters switch between issue voting and party voting depending on how much information is available to them about a given candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Highton, 455-458&lt;/ref&gt; [[Low information voter|Low-information elections]], such as those for [[Elections in the United States#Congressional elections|congressional candidates]], would thus be determined by [[Party politics|party voting]], whereas [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|presidential elections]], which tend to give voters much more information about each candidate, have the potential to be issue-driven.&lt;ref&gt;Enelow, 217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters typically choose a political party to affiliate with in one of two ways.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The voter will create an opinion of an issue without consulting what a political party thinks about it, then choose the political party that best fits the opinion they already have, or the voter will study the opinions of the different parties and decide which party he or she agrees with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 79, 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter's understanding of parties' principles is strengthened and developed over time as a person gains experience with more political events.&lt;ref&gt;Denver,21-23&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an issue to create the foundation for [[Political party|party]] choice, a voter must first be concerned about a particular issue and have some knowledge about that issue.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a person to be an issue voter, they must be able to recognize that there is more than one opinion about a particular issue, have formed a solid opinion about it and be able to relate that to a specific [[Political parties in the United States|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 246&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell, only 40 to 60 percent of the informed population even perceives party differences, and can thus partake in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 104&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that it is common for individuals to develop opinions of issues without the aid of a political party.

==History of issue voting==
Prior to [[Paul Lazarsfeld|''The People's Choice'']] study in 1944, it was assumed by political scientists that voting was based solely on issues.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 1, 2, 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study found little evidence of issue voting in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|United States presidential election of 1940]]. Rather, the researchers found that issues reinforced [[political party]] loyalties. Research stemming from the study concluded that voters' motivations could be broken down into three categories: [[party identification]], [[candidate]] orientation, and issue orientation. ''[[The American Voter]]'' in 1960 determined that party identification was the primary force, which in turn strongly influenced the other two categories. These three factors make up the Michigan School's approach to modeling voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, "Issue Voting"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest research on issue voting done in 1960 found that voters often did not have enough information to link specific issues to individual candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 109-102&lt;/ref&gt; Converse, in 1964, also concluded that voters did not have a sophisticated enough understanding of issues to be able to link them to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Converse, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Key was one of the first people to conclude that voters are able to connect issues to certain candidates and cast their vote based on that information.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing knowledge of the field, reliable evidence didn't begin to appear until the 1970s. ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a symposium that hypothesized that there was a rise in issue voting in the 1960s. Nie and Anderson published an analysis of correlations with issue orientations in 1974 that attempted to revise the Michigan School's theory of the public's political belief systems' inherent limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Nie (1974) 541-591&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nie et all in ''The Changing American Voter'' attempted to explain the rise in issue voting through the fall in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Nie 47-73&lt;/ref&gt; This decline of party voting, they claimed, came about because the proportion of the electorate with no party affiliation had fallen, and because the proportion of voters who cast votes for candidates from other parties had risen.

===Rise in issue voting===
In recent years, the United States has seen a rise in issue voting.  This can be attributed to the increased [[Political polarization|polarization]] in the last century between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these parties have become more extreme in their issue viewpoints. This has alienated [[moderate]]s from their parties.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large portion of American voters are moderates, an increase has been seen in the number people who choose to affiliate as [[Independent (voter)|Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
Identifying as an independent allows voters to avoid the constraints of a polarized political party. An independent voter can hand-pick a candidate based upon their positions on various issues rather than on their political party.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholics]] face the "issue voting vs. party voting" dilemma. Many Catholics support the [[opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] stance which is backed by Republicans, but strongly oppose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], which the Republican Party also supports. Extreme party polarization might cause Catholic voters to feel uncomfortable about both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[trade union|labor unions]] strongly identify with the Democratic Party's advocacy for workers' rights, but unions also tend to not support [[gay rights]], a stance which more closely aligns with Republican views.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications regarding issue voting==
Many factors can complicate issue voting. First, issues are not always [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; there are often many stances one could take.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 460&lt;/ref&gt; Voters often must settle for the candidate whose stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  This can prove difficult when two or more candidates have similar opinions, or when candidates have positions that are equally far from a voter's. An example of an issue which might be difficult to issue vote on is [[Education in the United States|education]] spending. A voter may have a drastically different opinion from the available candidates on how much money should be spent on schools; this could lead the individual to vote based on party affiliation instead.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

A second complexity is that, oftentimes, problems do not line up on linear bases. That is, some issues may make it hard to even determine the candidate with the closest position.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 US presidential election]] the growing threat of [[Communism]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] was a salient issue for voters.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many proposed solutions to this problem; [[Ronald Reagan]] endorsed military intimidation through increased spending and innovation (the [[Reagan Doctrine]]), [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed diplomatic efforts to keep peace, and the independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] advocated a return to the [[containment]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bisnow, 24&lt;/ref&gt; None of these answers are [[mutually exclusive]], and they cannot be linearly plotted.  The voter would instead have to choose the candidate whose opinion represented the closest mix of possible solutions to their own.

A third problem that can complicate issue voting is if there are multiple issues that are equally salient to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may have a similar position to a given voter on one issue, but may take a considerably different stance on another.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurred in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election]]. During this election, two issues dominating attention were the economy and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Many viewed these issues as equally salient, and had a hard time picking one issue to vote on. These three complexities in issue voting have provided problems in using this tactic to choosing candidates.

A fourth problem is that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the knowledge necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices do not reflect the vote choices that a fully informed voter would make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-bartels3-2008nov03-story.html|title=How smart is the American voter?|date=2008-11-03|work=|publisher=LA Times|via=|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of issue voting==
While scholars employ many models to study voting habits, there are three primary models used in statistical studies of issue voting: the linear position model, the spatial model and the salience model. Each model takes a different approach to issue voting into account.

[[File:Linear Model of Issue Voting, April 2012.jpg|thumb|Linear Model of Issue Voting|right]]
*The Linear Position Model attempts to predict how strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, a graph is used to display the relationship between the number of people voting for the party and the consistency of the issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; The equation “Y = a + bX” is used, where the variable “a” represents the minimal numbert of people voting for the party, “b” is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, "X" represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of people who vote for the party.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426-429&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spatial Model attempts to show the perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, 275&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that if someone’s issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates’ policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough,199-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other models that follow the idea of “closeness” are called proximity models.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 93, 96&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Salience Model asserts that the two major parties in the [[United States]] are associated with certain goals or views on an issue, and that the voter’s decision in selecting a candidate depends on the actual salience of the issue to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 93&lt;/ref&gt; This model is important when considering issue voting because it utilizes election agenda data to predict election outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niemi,1212&lt;/ref&gt; A simple view of this model can be summarized with the equation:

::Vote=a(Saliency of the party's issues)+b(Saliency of the party's issues)

::where "a"=Party 1, and "b"=Party 2

:The more important the issue becomes, the more a voter favors a particular candidate or party on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Italian irredentism in Dalmatia''' was the political movement supporting the unification to [[Italy]], during the 19th and 20th centuries, of adriatic [[Dalmatia]].

==History==

The ''only official evidence'' about the Dalmatian population comes from the 1857 Austro-Hungarian census, which showed that in this year there were 369,310 indigenous Croatians and 45,000 Italians in Dalmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.cl/books?id=r60EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=%C3%96sterreichisches+K%C3%BCstenland&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=de#PPA38,M1 Statistisches Handbüchlein für die Oesterreichische Monarchie] Page 38 - Von Direction der Administrativen Statistik, Österreich - Veröffentlicht 1861&lt;/ref&gt; making [[Dalmatian Italians]] 10.8% of the total population of Dalmatia in the mid-19th century.

Dalmatia was a strategic region during [[World War I]] that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy joined the [[Triple Entente]] [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1915 upon agreeing to the [[London Pact]] that guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy's participation on the Allied side. From  5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached [[Vis (island)|Vis]], [[Lastovo]], [[Šibenik]], and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo. ''History of Dalmatia''. Giardini, 1993. Pp. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact and by 17 November had seized  Fiume as well.&lt;ref name="Paul O 2005. Pp. 17"&gt;Paul O'Brien. ''Mussolini in the First World War: the Journalist, the Soldier, the Fascist''. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Berg, 2005. Pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Admiral [[Enrico Millo]] declared himself Italy's Governor of Dalmatia.&lt;ref name="Paul O 2005. Pp. 17"/&gt; Famous [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] Gabriele d'Annunzio supported the seizure of Dalmatia, and proceeded to occupy some areas in an Italian warship in December 1918.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rossi. ''The Rise of Italian Fascism: 1918-1922''. New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2010. Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last city with a significant Italian presence in Dalmatia was the city of Zara (now called [[Zadar]]). In the Habsburg empire census of 1910 the city of Zara had an Italian population of 9,318 (or 69.3% out of the total of 13,438 inhabitants). The population grew to 24,100 inhabitants, of which 20,300 Italians, when was in 1942 the capital of the [[Governatorate of Dalmatia]] (the "Governatorate" fulfilled the aspirations of the Italian irredentism in the Adriatic).

In 1943, [[Josip Broz Tito]] informed the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] that Zara was a chief logistic centre for German forces in Yugoslavia.  By overstating its importance, he persuaded them of its military significance. Italy surrendered in September 1943 and over the following year, specifically between 2 November 1943 and 31 October 1944, Allied Forces [[Bombing of Zadar in World War II|bombarded the town fifty-four times]].

Nearly 2,000 people were buried beneath rubble; 10–12,000 people escaped and took refuge in [[Trieste]] and slightly over 1,000 reached Apulia.

Tito's partisans entered in the city on 31 October 1944, and 138 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Lovrovici, don Giovanni Eleuterio. ''Zara dai bombardamenti all'esodo (1943-1947)'' Tipografia Santa Lucia - Marino. Roma, 1974. pag.66&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the Peace Treaty of 1947, Italians still living in the city and in Dalmatia followed the [[Istrian exodus|Italian exodus from Istria and Dalmatia]] and only about 100 [[Dalmatian Italians]] now remain in actual Zadar.

An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Plato]] in his work ''The Republic''. Advocates of divine command theory say that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like [[John Locke]] advocated [[natural rights]] as a derivative of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zuckert |first=Michael |title=The Natural Rights Republic |year=1996 |publisher=Notre Dame University Press |pages=73–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers in the [[social contract]] tradition state that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, [[utilitarian]] thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]] said that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the ''proper'' distribution. [[Egalitarianism|Egalitarians]] state that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. [[John Rawls]] used a theory of [[social contract]] to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like [[Robert Nozick]]) take a deontological view of distributive justice and state that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with [[punishment]] for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laurence |first=Timothy |editor-last=Laurence |editor-first=Timothy |title=Good News for the Public Square |publisher=LCF |date=2014 |page=xxii |chapter=Overview |isbn=978-0-9506454-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmony==

{{Main|The Republic (Plato)}}
[[File:Luca Giordano 013.jpg|thumb|''Justice'' by [[Luca Giordano]]]]
In his dialogue ''Republic'', [[Plato]] uses [[Socrates]] to argue for justice that covers both the just person and the just [[City State]]. Justice is a proper, harmonious relationship between the warring parts of the person or city. Hence, Plato's definition of justice is that justice is the having and doing of what is one's own. A just man is a man in just the right place, doing his best and giving the precise equivalent of what he has received. This applies both at the individual level and at the universal level. A person's soul has three parts&amp;nbsp;– reason, spirit and desire. Similarly, a city has three parts&amp;nbsp;– Socrates uses the parable of the chariot to illustrate his point: a chariot works as a whole because the two horses' power is directed by the charioteer. Lovers of wisdom&amp;nbsp;– philosophers, in one sense of the term&amp;nbsp;– [[Philosopher king|should rule]] because only they understand what is [[goodness and evil|good]]. If one is ill, one goes to a medic rather than a farmer, because the medic is expert in the subject of health. Similarly, one should trust one's city to an expert in the subject of the good, not to a mere [[politician]] who tries to gain power by giving people what they want, rather than what's good for them. Socrates uses the parable of the ship to illustrate this point: the unjust city is like a ship in open ocean, crewed by a powerful but drunken captain (the common people), a group of untrustworthy advisors who try to manipulate the captain into giving them power over the ship's course (the politicians), and a [[navigator]] (the philosopher) who is the only one who knows how to get the ship to port. For Socrates, the only way the ship will reach its destination&amp;nbsp;– the good&amp;nbsp;– is if the navigator takes charge.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' trans. Robin Waterfield (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine command==

{{Main|Divine command theory}}{{See also|Divine command}}
[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 012.jpg|thumb|Allegorical fresco cycle (cardinal virtues) by [[Renaissance]] painter [[Domenico di Pace Beccafumi]] from the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, scene: ’’Justitia’’]]
Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice, and indeed the whole of morality, is the authoritative command of God. Murder is wrong and must be punished, for instance, because God says it so. Some versions of the theory assert that God must be obeyed because of the nature of his relationship with humanity, others assert that God must be obeyed because he is goodness itself, and thus doing what he says would be best for everyone.

A meditation on the Divine command theory by [[Plato]] can be found in his dialogue, [[Euthyphro]]. Called the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], it goes as follows: "Is what is morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?" The implication is that if the latter is true, then justice is arbitrary; if the former is true, then morality exists on a higher order than God, who becomes little more than a passer-on of moral knowledge. A [[Argument from morality|response]], popularized in two contexts by [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[C. S. Lewis]], is that it is deductively valid to argue that the existence of an objective morality implies the existence of God and vice versa.

==Natural law==

{{Main|Natural law}}
[[File:VD-04-3.jpg|thumb|''Lex, justitia, pax'' ([[Latin]] for "Law, justice, peace") on the pediment of the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Supreme Court of Switzerland]]]]

For advocates of the theory that justice is part of natural law (e.g., [[John Locke]]), it involves the system of consequences that naturally derives from any action or choice. In this, it is similar to the laws of physics: in the same way as the Third of Newton's laws of Motion requires that for every action there must be an equal and opposite reaction, justice requires according individuals or groups what they actually deserve, merit, or are entitled to.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Justice, on this account, is a universal and absolute concept: laws, principles, religions, etc., are merely attempts to codify that concept, sometimes with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

===Despotism and skepticism===

In ''Republic'' by [[Plato]], the character [[Thrasymachus]] argues that justice is the interest of the strong&amp;nbsp;– merely a name for what the powerful or cunning ruler has imposed on the people.
{{further|The Republic (Plato)}}

===Mutual agreement===

{{Main|Social contract}}
Advocates of the social contract agree that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned; or, in many versions, from what they would agree to under ''hypothetical'' conditions including equality and absence of bias. This account is considered further below, under 'Justice as fairness'. The absence of bias refers to an equal ground for all people concerned in a disagreement (or trial in some cases).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Subordinate value===
According to utilitarian thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]], justice is not as fundamental as we often think. Rather, it is derived from the more basic standard of rightness, [[consequentialism]]: what is right is what has the best consequences (usually measured by the total or average [[Quality of life|welfare]] caused). So, the proper principles of justice are those that tend to have the best consequences. These rules may turn out to be familiar ones such as keeping [[contract]]s; but equally, they may not, depending on the facts about real consequences. Either way, what is important is those consequences, and justice is important, if at all, only as derived from that fundamental standard. Mill tries to explain our mistaken belief that justice is overwhelmingly important by arguing that it derives from two natural human tendencies: our desire to retaliate against those who hurt us, or the feeling of self-defense and our ability to put ourselves imaginatively in another's place, sympathy. So, when we see someone harmed, we project ourselves into her situation and feel a desire to retaliate on her behalf. If this process is the source of our feelings about justice, that ought to undermine our confidence in them.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''Utilitarianism'' in ''On Liberty and Other Essays'' ed. John Gray (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of distributive justice==
{{Main|Distributive justice}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Theories of distributive justice need to answer three questions:
# ''What goods'' are to be distributed? Is it to be [[wealth]], [[Political power|power]], [[respect]], opportunities or some combination of these things?
# ''Between what entities'' are they to be distributed? Humans (dead, living, future), [[Sentience|sentient]] beings, the members of a single society, [[nation]]s?
# What is the ''proper'' distribution? Equal, [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]], according to [[social status]], according to [[need]], based on property rights and non-aggression?

Distributive justice theorists generally do not answer questions of ''who has the right'' to enforce a particular favored distribution.  On the other hand, property rights theorists argue that there is no "favored distribution."  Rather, distribution should be based simply on whatever distribution results from lawful interactions or transactions (that is, transactions which are not illicit).

This section describes some widely held theories of distributive justice, and their attempts to answer these questions.

===Social justice===
{{Main|Social justice}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Social justice is concerned with the just relationship between individuals and their society, often considering how privileges, opportunities, and wealth ought to be distributed among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/social_justice|title=social justice {{!}} Definition of social justice in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice is distinct from egalitarianism, which is the idea that all people are equal in terms of status, value, or rights, as social justice theories do not all require equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/egalitarianism|title=egalitarianism {{!}} Definition of egalitarianism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sociologist [[George C. Homans]] suggested that the root of the concept of justice is that each person should receive rewards that are proportional to their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubinstein|first=David|date=1988|title=The Concept of Justice in Sociology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/657654|journal=Theory and Society|volume=17|issue=4|pages=527–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2668194|title=Social behavior; its elementary forms.|last=Homans|first=George Caspar|publisher=Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich|year=1974|isbn=0155814176|edition= Rev.|location=New York,|pages=246–249|oclc=2668194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the egalitarian, justice can exist only within the parameters of equality. This basic view can be elaborated in many ways, according to what goods are to be distributed&amp;nbsp;– wealth, respect, opportunity&amp;nbsp;– and who or what they are to be distributed equally among&amp;nbsp;– individuals, families, nations, races, species. Egalitarian theories are typically less concerned with discussing who exactly will do the distributing or what effects their recommended policies will have on the production of the goods, services, or resources they wish to distribute.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Commonly held egalitarian positions include demands for [[equality of opportunity]], though equality of opportunity is often defended by adherents of nonegalitarian conceptions of justice as well. Some variants of egalitarianism affirm that justice without equality is hollow and that equality itself is the highest justice, though such a formulation will have concrete meaning only once the main terms have been fleshed out.

At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are communism, socialism, [[left-libertarianism]], and progressivism, which propound economic, political, and legal egalitarianism, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Fairness===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Justice statue.jpg|thumb|J. L. Urban, statue of [[Lady Justice]] at court building in [[Olomouc]], [[Czech Republic]]]]

In his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', [[John Rawls]] used a [[social contract]] argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness: an impartial distribution of goods. Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves behind a [[veil of ignorance]] that denies us all knowledge of our personalities, social statuses, moral characters, wealth, talents and life plans, and then asks what theory of justice we would choose to govern our society when the veil is lifted, if we wanted to do the best that we could for ourselves. We don't know who in particular we are, and therefore can't bias the decision in our own favour. So, the decision-in-ignorance models fairness, because it excludes selfish [[bias]]. Rawls argues that each of us would reject the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theory of justice that we should maximize welfare (see below) because of the risk that we might turn out to be someone whose own good is sacrificed for greater benefits for others. Instead, we would endorse Rawls's ''two principles of justice'':
* Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.
* Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both
** to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and
** attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (revised edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

This imagined choice justifies these principles as the principles of justice for us, because we would agree to them in a fair decision procedure. Rawls's theory distinguishes two kinds of goods&amp;nbsp;– (1) [[Freedom (political)|the good of liberty rights]] and (2) social and economic goods, i.e. wealth, income and power&amp;nbsp;– and applies different distributions to them&amp;nbsp;– equality between citizens for (1), equality unless inequality improves the position of the worst off for (2).

In one sense, theories of distributive justice may assert that everyone should get what they deserve. Theories disagree on the meaning of what is "deserved". The main distinction is between theories that argue the basis of just deserts ought to be held equally by everyone, and therefore derive egalitarian accounts of distributive justice&amp;nbsp;– and theories that argue the basis of just deserts is unequally distributed on the basis of, for instance, hard work, and therefore derive accounts of distributive justice by which some should have more than others.

According to ''[[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]'' theories, goods, especially wealth and [[social status]], should be distributed to match individual ''merit'', which is usually understood as some combination of talent and hard work. According to ''[[need]]s''-based theories, goods, especially such basic goods as food, shelter and medical care, should be distributed to meet individuals' [[basic needs]] for them. [[Marxism]] is a needs-based theory, expressed succinctly in [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] slogan "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, 'Critique of the Gotha Program' in ''Karl Marx: Selected writings'' ed. David McLellan (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977): 564–70, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''contribution''-based theories, goods should be distributed to match an individual's contribution to the overall social good.

===Property rights===
{{further|Libertarianism|Constitutional economics}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
In ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', [[Robert Nozick]] argues that distributive justice is not a matter of the whole distribution matching an ideal ''pattern'', but of each individual entitlement having the right kind of ''history''. It is just that a person has some good (especially, some [[Property rights|property right]]) if and only if they came to have it by a history made up entirely of events of two kinds:
* Just ''acquisition'', especially by working on unowned things; and
* Just ''transfer'', that is free gift, sale or other agreement, but not [[theft]] (i.e. by force or fraud).

If the chain of events leading up to the person having something meets this criterion, they are entitled to it: that they possess it is just, and what anyone else does or doesn't have or need is irrelevant.

On the basis of this theory of distributive justice, Nozick argues that all attempts to redistribute goods according to an ideal pattern, without the consent of their owners, are theft. In particular, [[redistribution (economics)|redistributive taxation]] is theft.

Some property rights theorists (like Nozick) also take a consequentialist view of distributive justice and argue that property rights based justice also has the effect of maximizing the overall wealth of an economic system.  They explain that voluntary (non-coerced) transactions always have a property called [[Pareto efficiency]]. The result is that the world is better off in an absolute sense and no one is worse off.  Such consequentialist property rights theorists argue that respecting property rights maximizes the number of Pareto efficient transactions in the world and minimized the number of non-Pareto efficient transactions in the world (i.e. transactions where someone is made worse off).  The result is that the world will have generated the greatest total benefit from the limited, scarce resources available in the world.  Further, this will have been accomplished without taking anything away from anyone unlawfully.

===Welfare-maximization===
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. This may require sacrifice of some for the good of others, so long as everyone's good is taken impartially into account. Utilitarianism, in general, argues that the standard of justification for actions, institutions, or the whole world, is ''impartial welfare consequentialism'', and only indirectly, if at all, to do with [[Human rights|rights]], [[property]], [[need]], or any other non-utilitarian criterion. These other criteria might be indirectly important, to the extent that human welfare involves them. But even then, such demands as human rights would only be elements in the calculation of overall welfare, not uncrossable barriers to action.

==Theories of retributive justice==
{{Main|Retributive justice}}

[[File:Justicia Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Justitia'' (Justice), outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]
Theories of retributive justice are concerned with [[punishment]] for wrongdoing, and need to answer three questions:
# ''why'' punish?
# ''who'' should be punished?
# ''what punishment'' should they receive?
This section considers the two major accounts of retributive justice, and their answers to these questions. ''Utilitarian'' theories look forward to the future consequences of punishment, while ''retributive'' theories look back to particular acts of wrongdoing, and attempt to balance them with deserved punishment.

===Utilitarianism===
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. Punishment fights crime in three ways:
# ''[[Deterrence (legal)|Deterrence]]''. The credible [[coercion|threat]] of punishment might lead people to make different choices; well-designed threats might lead people to make choices that maximize welfare. This matches some strong [[intuition]]s about just punishment: that it should generally be proportional to the crime.
# ''[[Rehabilitation (penology)|Rehabilitation]]''. Punishment might make bad people into better ones. For the utilitarian, all that 'bad person' can mean is 'person who's likely to cause bad things (like suffering)'. So, utilitarianism could recommend punishment that changes someone such that they are less likely to cause bad things.
# ''[[Incapacitation (penology)|Security/Incapacitation]]''. Perhaps there are people who are irredeemable causers of bad things. If so, [[Prison|imprisoning]] them might maximize welfare by limiting their opportunities to cause harm and therefore the benefit lies within protecting society.
So, the reason for punishment is the maximization of welfare, and punishment should be of whomever, and of whatever form and severity, are needed to meet that goal. This may sometimes justify punishing the innocent, or inflicting disproportionately severe punishments, when that will have the best consequences overall (perhaps executing a few suspected [[Shoplifting|shoplifters]] live on television would be an effective deterrent to shoplifting, for instance). It also suggests that punishment might turn out ''never'' to be right, depending on the facts about what actual consequences it has.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Ten, 'Crime and Punishment' in Peter Singer ed., ''A Companion to Ethics'' (Oxford: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishing]], 1993): 366–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retributivism===
The retributivist will think [[consequentialism]] is mistaken. If someone does something wrong we must respond by punishing for the committed action itself, regardless of what outcomes punishment produces. Wrongdoing must be balanced or made good in some way, and so the criminal ''deserves'' to be punished. It says that all guilty people, and only guilty people, deserve appropriate punishment. This matches some strong [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitions]] about just punishment: that it should be ''proportional'' to the crime, and that it should be of ''only'' and ''all of'' the guilty.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However, it is sometimes argued that retributivism is merely [[revenge]] in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, ''Punishment: The supposed justifications'' (London: Hutchinson &amp; Co., 1969), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences between retribution and revenge: the former is impartial and has a scale of appropriateness, whereas the latter is personal and potentially unlimited in scale.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Restorative justice===
{{Main|Restorative justice}}

Restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders, instead of satisfying abstract legal principles or punishing the offender. Victims take an active role in the process, while offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, "to repair the harm they've done&amp;nbsp;– by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service". It is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community rather than the state. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender shows the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Braswell, and John Fuller, ''Corrections, Peacemaking and Restorative Justice: Transforming Individuals and Institutions'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed theories===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Some modern philosophers have argued that Utilitarian and Retributive theories are not mutually exclusive. For example, [[Andrew von Hirsch]], in his 1976 book ''Doing Justice'', suggested that we have a moral obligation to punish greater crimes more than lesser ones. However, so long as we adhere to that constraint then utilitarian ideals would play a significant secondary role.

==Theories==

===Rawls' theory of justice===
{{further|Justice (virtue)|Cardinal virtues}}
It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Eric Heinze, ''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013), pp. 4–10, 50–60.&lt;/ref&gt; that 'systematic' or 'programmatic' political and moral philosophy in the West begins, in [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]], with the question, 'What is Justice?'&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', Book I, 331b–c.&lt;/ref&gt; According to most contemporary theories of justice, justice is overwhelmingly important: [[John Rawls]] claims that "Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought."&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (revised edn, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In classical approaches, evident from [[Plato]] through to [[John Rawls|Rawls]], the concept of 'justice' is always construed in logical or 'etymological' opposition to the concept of injustice. Such approaches cite various examples of injustice, as problems which a theory of justice must overcome.  A number of post-World War II approaches do, however, challenge that seemingly obvious dualism between those two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;
*See, e.g., Eric Heinze, ''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013).
*Clive Barnett ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice can be thought of as distinct from [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], [[prudence (virtue)|prudence]], [[mercy]], [[generosity]], or [[compassion]], although these dimensions are regularly understood to also be interlinked. Justice is the concept of [[cardinal virtue]]s, of which it is one.  Metaphysical justice has often been associated with concepts of [[destiny|fate]], [[reincarnation]] or [[Divine Providence]], i.e., with a life in accordance with a cosmic plan. The association of justice with fairness is thus historically and culturally inalienable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daston|first=Lorraine|year=2008|journal=Daedalus|pages=5–14|title=Life, Chance and Life Chances|doi=10.1162/daed.2008.137.1.5|volume=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equality before the law===
Law raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice. There is an old saying that '[[All are equal before the law]]'. The belief in equality before the law is called legal egalitarianism. In criticism of this belief, the author [[Anatole France]] said in 1894, "In its majestic equality, the law forbids [[rich and poor alike]] to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread."&lt;ref&gt;(France, ''The Red Lily'', [http://www.online-literature.com/anatole-france/red-lily/8/ Chapter VII]).&lt;/ref&gt; With this saying, France illustrated the fundamental shortcoming of a theory of legal equality that remains blind to social inequality;
the same law applied to all may have disproportionately harmful effects on the least powerful.

===Classical liberalism===
Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref name=kukathas/&gt;&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; Classical liberalism calls for equality before the law, not for [[equality of outcome]].&lt;ref name=kukathas&gt;[[Chandran Kukathas]], "Ethical Pluralism from a Classical Liberal Perspective," in ''The Many and the One: Religious and Secular Perspectives on Ethical Pluralism in the Modern World'', ed. Richard Madsen and Tracy B. Strong, Ethikon Series in Comparative Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003), 61 ({{ISBN|0-691-09993-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Classical liberalism opposes pursuing [[group rights]] at the expense of [[individual rights]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Mark Evans, ed., ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'' (London: Routledge, 2001), 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and spirituality===

====Abrahamic justice====
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumbnail|''Moses with the [[Tablets of Law]]'', by [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]]]]

[[Judaism|Jews]], [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Christianity|Christians]] traditionally believe that justice is a present, real, right, and, specifically, governing concept along with [[mercy]], and that justice is ultimately derived from and held by [[God]]. According to the [[Bible]], such [[institution]]s as the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] were created by God to require the [[Israelites]] to live by and apply His standards of justice.

The Hebrew Bible describes God as saying about the Judeo-Christian [[patriarch]] [[Abraham]]: "No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice;...." ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:19, [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV)]]. The [[Psalms|Psalmist]] describes God as having "Righteousness and justice [as] the foundation of [His] throne;...." (Psalms 89:14, NRSV).

The [[New Testament]] also describes God and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as having and displaying justice, often in comparison with God displaying and supporting [[mercy]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:7).

===Theories of sentencing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
In [[criminal law]], a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] forms the final explicit act of a [[judge]]-ruled process, and also the symbolic principal act connected to his function. The sentence can generally involve a decree of [[prison|imprisonment]], a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] and/or other [[punishment]]s against a [[defendant]] [[conviction (law)|convicted]] of a [[crime]]. Laws may specify the range of penalties that can be imposed for various offenses, and sentencing guidelines sometimes regulate what punishment within those ranges can be imposed given a certain set of offense and offender characteristics. The most common purposes of sentencing in legal theory are:

|- style="background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;"
! Theory
! Aim of theory
! Suitable punishment
|-
|[[Retributive justice|Retribution]]
| Punishment imposed for no reason other than an offense being committed, on the basis that if [[Eye for an eye|proportionate]], punishment is morally acceptable as a response that satisfies the aggrieved party, their intimates and society.
|
* Tariff sentences
* Sentence must be proportionate to the crime
|-
|[[Deterrence (legal)|Deterrence]]

* To the individual&amp;nbsp;– the individual is deterred through fear of further punishment.
* To the general public&amp;nbsp;– Potential offenders warned as to likely punishment
|
* Prison Sentence
* Heavy Fine
* Long sentence as an example to others
|-
|[[Rehabilitation (penology)|Rehabilitation]]
|To reform the offender's behavior
|
* Individualized sentences
* Community service orders
* moral education
* vocational education
|-
|[[Incapacitation (penology)|Incapacitation]]
|Offender is made incapable of committing further crime to protect society at large from crime
|
* Long prison sentence
* Electronic tagging
* Banning orders
|-
|[[Restorative justice|Reparation]]
|Repayment to victim(s) or to community
|
* Compensation
* Unpaid work
* Reparation Schemes
|-
|[[Denunciation (penology)|Denunciation]]
|Society expressing its disapproval reinforcing moral boundaries
|
* Reflects blameworthiness of offense
* punishment in public
* punishment reported to public

|-
|}

In [[civil law (common law)|civil cases]] the decision is usually known as a [[verdict]], or judgment, rather than a sentence. Civil cases are settled primarily by means of monetary compensation for harm done ("[[damages]]") and orders intended to prevent future harm (for example [[injunction]]s). Under some legal systems an award of damages involves some scope for retribution, denunciation and deterrence, by means of additional categories of damages beyond simple compensation, covering a [[Punitive damages|punitive effect, social disapprobation, and potentially, deterrence]], and occasionally [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorgement]] (forfeit of any gain, even if no loss was caused to the other party).

===Evolutionary perspectives===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Gerechtigkeit-1537.jpg|thumb|"Justice as a naked woman with a [[sword]] and [[Weighing scale|balance]]" by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1537]]

[[Evolutionary ethic]]s and an argued [[evolution of morality]] suggest [[evolutionary]] bases for the concept of justice. [[Biosocial criminology]] research argues that human perceptions of what is appropriate criminal justice are based on how to respond to crimes in the ancestral small-group environment and that these responses may not always be appropriate for today's societies.

===Reactions to fairness===
[[File:Justitia, Jost Amman.png|thumb|‘’Justitia’’, copper engraving by [[Jost Amman]], made between 1539 and 1591]]
Studies at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in 2008 have indicated that reactions to fairness are "wired" into the brain and that, "Fairness is activating the same part of the brain that responds to food in rats... This is consistent with the notion that being treated fairly satisfies a basic need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/brain-reacts-to-fairness-as-it-49042.aspx?link_page_rss=49042 |title=Brain reacts to fairness as it does to money and chocolate, study shows |work=UCLA Newsroom |publisher= UCLA |date=April 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in 2003 at [[Emory University]] involving capuchin monkeys demonstrated that other cooperative animals also possess such a sense and that "[[inequity aversion]] may not be uniquely human".&lt;ref&gt;Nature 425, 297–99 (18 September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions and justice===

In a world where people are interconnected but they disagree, institutions are required to instantiate ideals of justice. These institutions may be justified by their approximate instantiation of justice, or they may be deeply unjust when compared with ideal standards&amp;nbsp;– consider the institution of [[slavery]]. Justice is an ideal the world fails to live up to, sometimes due to deliberate opposition to justice despite understanding, which could be disastrous. The question of institutive justice raises issues of [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]], [[Legal procedure|procedure]], [[Codification (law)|codification]] and [[statutory interpretation|interpretation]], which are considered by legal theorists and by [[Philosophy of law|philosophers of law]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In its classical usage, left-libertarianism is a synonym for [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] varieties of [[left-wing politics]], e.g. [[libertarian socialism]], which includes [[anarchism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]] among others.&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bookchinreader"&gt;Bookchin, Murray and Biehl, Janet (1997). ''The Murray Bookchin Reader''. Cassell:  p. 170. {{ISBN|0-304-33873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-libertarianism can also refer to political positions associated with academic philosophers [[Hillel Steiner]], [[Philippe Van Parijs]] and [[Peter Vallentyne]] that combine [[self-ownership]] with an egalitarian approach to [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref name="oxfordcompanion"&gt;[[Will Kymlicka|Kymlicka, Will]] (2005). "libertarianism, left-". In [[Ted Honderich|Honderich, Ted]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. New York City: [[Oxford University Press]].  p. 516.  {{ISBN|978-0199264797}}. "'Left-libertarianism' is a new term for an old conception of justice, dating back to Grotius. It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George. Recent exponents include Philippe Van Parijs and Hillel Steiner."&lt;/ref&gt;

While maintaining full respect for [[personal property]], left-libertarians are skeptical of or fully against private ownership of natural resources, arguing that neither claiming nor [[Labor theory of property|mixing one's labor]] with [[natural resource]]s is enough to generate full [[Right to property|private property rights]]&lt;ref name="socialhistory"&gt;Carlson, Jennifer D. (2012). "Libertarianism". In Miller, Wilbur R. ''The social history of crime and punishment in America''.  London: Sage Publications. p. 1007. {{ISBN|1412988764}}. "Left-libertarians disagree with right-libertarians with respect to property rights, arguing instead that individuals have no inherent right to natural resources.  Namely, these resources must be treated as collective property that is made available on an egalitarian basis".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rhteol"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Narveson|first1=Jan|last2=Trenchard|first2=David|authorlink1=Jan Narveson|editor-first=Ronald|editor-last=Hamowy|editor-link=Ronald Hamowy|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|title=Left libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC|year=2008|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]]|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n174|isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4|oclc=750831024|lccn=2008009151|pages=288–289|quote=Left libertarians regard each of us as full self-owners. However, they differ from what we generally understand by the term ''libertarian'' in denying the right to private property.  We own ourselves, but we do not own nature, at least not as individuals. Left libertarians embrace the view that all natural resources, land, oil, gold, and so on should be held collectively. To the extent that individuals make use of these commonly owned goods, they must do so only with the permission of society, a permission granted only under the proviso that a certain payment for their use be made to society at large.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintain that natural resources (raw land, oil, gold, the electromagnetic spectrum, air-space, etc.) should be held in an egalitarian manner, either [[Unowned property|unowned]] or [[Common ownership|owned collectively]]. Those left-libertarians who support private property do so under the condition that recompense is offered to the [[Local community|local]] or even [[global community]].&lt;ref name="rhteol"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[left-wing market anarchism]], which includes [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]]'s [[agorism]], appeals to left-wing concerns such as [[egalitarianism]], [[gender]] and [[Sexual identity|sexuality]], [[Social class|class]], [[immigration]] and [[environmentalism]] within the paradigm of a [[Market socialism|socialist free market]].&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"/&gt; In the United States, the word "libertarian" has become associated with [[right-libertarianism]] after [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Karl Hess]] reached out to the [[New Left]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin (15 June 2014). [http://c4ss.org/content/28216 "What is Left-Libertarianism?"]. Center for a Stateless Society.&lt;/ref&gt; However, until then political usage of the word was associated exclusively with [[anti-capitalism]] and in most parts of the world such an association still predominates.

== Definition ==
The term left-libertarian has been used to refer to a variety of different [[Political economy|political economic]] [[Political philosophy|philosophies]], emphasizing [[Civil liberties|individual liberty]]. According to one textbook: &lt;blockquote&gt;The term "left-libertanism" has at least three meanings. In its oldest sense, it is a synonym either for anarchism in general or social anarchism in particular. Later it became a term for the left or Konkinite wing of the free-market libertarian movement, and has since come to cover a range of pro-market but anti-capitalist positions, mostly individualist anarchist, including agorism and mutualism, often with an implication of sympathies (such as for radical feminism or the labor movement) not usually shared by anarcho-capitalists. In a third sense it has recently come to be applied to a position combining individual self-ownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources; most proponents of this position are not anarchists.&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Henry George.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry George]] proposed the abolition of all [[tax]]es except those on [[Land value tax|land value]]]]
Contemporary left-libertarian scholars such as [[Hillel Steiner]], [[Peter Vallentyne]], [[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Michael Otsuka]] and [[David Ellerman]] root an economic egalitarianism in the [[classical liberal]] concepts of [[self-ownership]] and [[Appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]. They hold that it is illegitimate for anyone to claim private ownership of [[natural resource]]s to the detriment of others, a condition [[John Locke]] explicated in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kymlicka, Will (2005).  "libertarianism, left-."  ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.  In Honderich, Ted.  New York: Oxford University Press.  "[Left-libertarians maintain that] the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property."&lt;/ref&gt; Locke argued that natural resources could be appropriated as long as doing so satisfies the [[Lockean proviso|proviso]] that there remains "enough, and as good, left in common for others".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John (1689).  ''Two Treatises of Government''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, unappropriated natural resources are either unowned or owned in common and private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount or the property is taxed to compensate those who are excluded. This position is articulated in contrast to the position of [[Right-libertarianism|other libertarians]] who argue for a characteristically labor-based right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as [[Land (economics)|land]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982). ''The Ethics of Liberty''.

Economists since [[Adam Smith]] have known that—unlike other forms of taxation—a [[land value tax]] would not cause economic inefficiency.&lt;ref name="Adam Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Wealth of Nations, Book V|date=1776|chapter=Chapter 2, Article 1: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be a [[progressive tax]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suits|first1=Daniel B.|title=Measurement of Tax Progressivity|journal=The American Economic Review, published by American Economic Association|date=Sep 1977|volume=67|issue=4|pages=747–52|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1813408?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21105057475763|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, a tax paid primarily by the wealthy—that increases wages, reduces [[economic inequality]], removes incentives to misuse real estate and reduces the vulnerability that economies face from credit and property bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suits|first=Daniel B.|title=Measurement of Tax Progressivity|journal=American Economic Review|date=September 1977|volume=67|issue=4|pages=747–52|jstor=1813408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCluskey and Franzsen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&amp;pg=PA73 Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis, William J.

Franzsen]&lt;/ref&gt; Early proponents of this view include [[Thomas Paine]], [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Hugo Grotius]],&lt;ref name="oxfordcompanion"/&gt; but the concept was widely popularized by the [[Political economy|political economist]] and social reformer [[Henry George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foldvary|first=Fred|title=Geoism Explained|url=http://www.progress.org/views/editorials/geoism-explained/|publisher=The Progress Report|accessdate=12 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317210356/http://www.progress.org/views/editorials/geoism-explained/|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George believed that people ought to own the fruits of their labor and the value of the improvements they make, thus he was opposed to [[tariff]]s, [[income tax]]es, [[sales tax]]es, [[tax per head|poll taxes]], [[property tax]]es (on improvements) and to any [[tax]] on [[Production (economics)|production]], [[consumption tax|consumption]] or capital [[Wealth tax|wealth]].

Early followers of Henry George's philosophy called themselves "[[single tax]]ers" because they believed the only economically and morally legitimate, broad-based tax is on land rent.

[[Oxford University]] philosopher [[G. A. Cohen]] extensively criticized the claim, characteristic of the Georgist school of political economy, that self-ownership and a privilege-free society can be realized simultaneously. In ''Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality'', Cohen argued that any system purporting to take equality and its enforcement seriously is not consistent with the full emphasis on self-ownership and [[Negative liberty|negative freedom]] that defines market libertarian thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom G.

{{main|Anarchism}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the first self-described [[Anarchism|anarchist]]]]
Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies characterized by self-governed, non-hierarchical, voluntary institutions. It developed in the 19th century from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;(2006).  "Anarchism".  ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s and in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. (1982).  ''The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society''.  Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research.  p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; According to anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work".&lt;ref name="EB1910"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin instead attached his ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, William (1793).  ''[[Political Justice]]''.  "Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in [Edmund] Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence".&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of [[philosophical anarchism]]. He argued in ''[[Political Justice]]'' that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian (2001). ''Political Ideology Today''. Manchester University Press. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought the proliferation of reason would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power, rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=godwin|title=William Godwin|last=Philip|first=Mark|date=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]]|last=Godwin|first=William|authorlink=William Godwin|year=1796|publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson|oclc=2340417|origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's "mental enslavement", the foundations of law, [[property rights]] and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.

In France, revolutionaries began using the term ''anarchiste'' in a positive light as early as September 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean (2004). ''Anarchism''. London. Reaktion Books Ltd. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the first self-proclaimed anarchist (a label he adopted in his treatise ''[[What is Property?]]'') and is often described as the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, Daniel (1970). ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice''.  New York: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society in which organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests, saying: "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". Proudhon answers his own question in ''What is Property?'' with the famous statement: "[[Property is theft]]". He opposed the institution of decreed property ("proprietorship") in which owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish&lt;ref name="proudhon-prop"&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph]] (1840). [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm "Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property"]. In ''[[What is Property?]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and contrasted this with [[usufruct]] ("possession") or limited ownership of resources only while in more or less continuous use. Later, Proudhon added that "Property is Liberty" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Stewart (1969).  "Introduction".  In ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon''. Anchor Books, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the state, organized religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

In a scathing letter written in 1857, French anarchist [[Joseph Déjacque]] castigated Proudhon for his [[sexist]] economic and political views.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm "De l'être-humain mâle et femelle–Lettre à P.J. Proudhon"] (1857).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Peter (2009). ''Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism''. Oakland,  Oakland, CA. PM Press. p. 641. "The word 'libertarian' has long been associated with anarchism, and has been used repeatedly throughout this work.  The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph Déjacque as the title of his anarchist journal ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist Sébastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas|volume=Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300 CE–1939)|year=2005|location=Montreal|publisher=Black Rose Books|editor=Robert Graham|chapter=|author=|at=§17|editor-link=Robert Graham (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature".&lt;ref&gt;(21 September 1858).

His political ideas had much in common with those of [[Richard Price]], [[Joseph Priestly]] [''sic''], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a Socialist economic order".&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/rudolf-rocker-anarchosyndicalism "Anarchosyndicalism" by [[Rudolf Rocker]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pi i Margall was a dedicated theorist in his own right, especially through book-length works such as ''La reacción y la revolución'' ("Reaction and revolution") in 1855, ''Las nacionalidades'' ("Nationalities") in 1877 and ''La Federación'' ("Federation") in 1880.

In the 1950s, [[classical liberal]]s in the United States began identifying as libertarians in order to distance themselves from the [[social liberal]]s of the [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Jennifer (2009).

"Although it did not become widely used until the 1950s, 'libertarian' was in circulation prior to the New Deal.  It emerged after Roosevelt popularized a new understanding of 'liberal,' the term formerly used by advocates of limited government."&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time, it has become useful to distinguish this modern American libertarianism, which promotes laissez-faire [[capitalism]] and generally a [[night-watchman state]], from traditional, left-wing anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Goodway, David (2006).

"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism).  There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone.  From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions--the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions--neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a laissez-faire 'free' market.  ...  Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory.  The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all."&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the former is often described as [[right-wing libertarianism]] or simply right-libertarianism, while synonyms for the latter include left-libertarianism,&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"&gt;Anarchism".

"What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left,  –  follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

While with notable exceptions American market-oriented libertarians after [[Benjamin Tucker]] tended to ally with the political right, relationships between such libertarians and the [[New Left]] thrived in the 1960s, laying the groundwork for modern [[left-wing market anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, Roderick T. (2006). "[https://mises.org/daily/2099 Rothbard's 'Left and Right': Forty Years Later]".  Rothbard Memorial Lecture, Austrian Scholars Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism,&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo, Justin (2001). ''An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard''.  Amherst, NY: Prometheus.&lt;/ref&gt; but long embraced a reading of American history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions, one that was thus naturally agreeable to many on the left. In the 1960s, he came increasingly to seek alliances on the left, especially with members of the New Left, in light of the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo.  pp. 151–209.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[military draft]] and the emergence of the [[black power]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Brian M. (2007). ''Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement''. New York: Public Affairs. p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with other radicals like [[Ronald Radosh]] and [[Karl Hess]], Rothbard argued that the consensus view of American economic history, according to which a beneficent government has used its power to counter corporate predation, is fundamentally flawed. Rather, government intervention in the economy has largely benefited established players at the expense of marginalized groups, to the detriment of both liberty and equality. Moreover, the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]] period, hailed by the right and despised by the left as a heyday of ''[[laissez-faire]]'', was not characterized by ''laissez-faire'' at all, but it was a time of massive state privilege accorded to capital.&lt;ref&gt;On partnerships between the state and big business and the role of big business in promoting regulation, see Gabriel Kolko, ''The Triumph of Conservatism: A Reinterpretation of American History, 1900–1916'' (New York: Free 1977); Butler Shaffer, ''In Restraint of Trade: The Business Campaign against Competition, 1918–1938'' (Auburn, AL: Mises 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with his emphasis on the intimate connection between state and corporate power, he defended the seizure of corporations dependent on state largesse by workers and others.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (15 June 1969). "Confiscation and the Homestead Principle." ''Libertarian Forum''. '''1''':6. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard himself ultimately broke with the left, allying himself instead with the burgeoning [[paleoconservative]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;See Raimondo 277–78; Doherty 562–65.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the tendency of left-libertarians to appeal to "'free spirits,' to people who don't want to push other people around, and who don't want to be pushed around themselves" in contrast to "the bulk of Americans", who "might well be tight-assed conformists, who want to stamp out drugs in their vicinity, kick out people with strange dress habits, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard, letter to David Bergland, 5 June 1986, qtd. Raimondo 263–64. Rothbard emphasized that this was relevant as a matter of strategy: the failure to pitch the libertarian message to Middle America, he wrote, might result in the loss of "the tight-assed majority."&lt;/ref&gt; Some thinkers associated with market-oriented American libertarianism, drawing on the work of Rothbard during his alliance with the left and on the thought of Karl Hess, came increasingly to identify with the left on a range of issues, including opposition to war, to [[Oligopoly|corporate oligopolies]] and state-corporate partnerships, and an affinity for [[cultural liberalism]].

"[http://charleswjohnson.name/essays/libertarian-feminism Libertarian Feminism: Can this Marriage Be Saved?]" Molinari Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this school typically urge the abolition of the state, arguing that vast disparities in wealth and social influence result from the use of force—especially state power—to steal and engross land and acquire and maintain special privileges. They judge that in a stateless society the kinds of privileges secured by the state will be absent and injustices perpetrated or tolerated by the state can be rectified, thus they conclude that with state interference eliminated it will be possible to achieve "socialist ends by market means".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, Gary (2009). ''Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays''. Tulsa, OK: Tulsa Alliance of the Libertarian Left.&lt;/ref&gt; According to libertarian scholar Sheldon Richman: {{quote|Left-libertarians favor worker solidarity vis-à-vis bosses, support poor people's [[squatting]] on government or abandoned property, and prefer that corporate privileges be repealed before the regulatory restrictions on how those privileges may be exercised. They see [[Walmart]] as a symbol of corporate favoritism – supported by highway subsidies and eminent domain – view the fictive personhood of the [[Limited liability company|limited-liability corporation]] with suspicion, and doubt that [[Third World]] [[sweatshop]]s would be the "best alternative" in the absence of government manipulation. Left-libertarians tend to eschew electoral politics, having little confidence in strategies that work through the government. They prefer to develop alternative institutions and methods of working around the state.&lt;ref name="LibertarianLeft"/&gt;}}

Agorism is an anarchist tendency founded by Samuel Edward Konkin III which advocates [[counter-economics]], working in untaxable [[black market|black]] or [[grey market]]s and boycotting as much as possible the unfree, taxed market with the intended result that private voluntary institutions emerge and outcompete statist ones.

Left-libertarians of the Carson–Long school (called left-wing market anarchists), referenced below, typically endorse the labor-based property rights Steiner–Vallentyne left-libertarians reject, but hold that implementing such rights would have radical rather than conservative consequences.

{{distinguish|Legitimacy (family law)}}
[[File:John Locke by Herman Verelst.png|thumb|185px|right|[[John Locke]]: consent of the governed confers political legitimacy.]]
In [[political science]], '''legitimacy''' is the right and acceptance of an [[authority]], usually a governing law or a [[regime|régime]]. Whereas "authority" denotes a specific position in an established government, the term "legitimacy" denotes a ''system'' of government—wherein 
"government" denotes "[[sphere of influence]]". An authority viewed as legitimate often has the right and justification to exercise [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Political legitimacy is considered a basic condition for governing, without which a government will suffer legislative deadlock(s) and collapse. In political systems where this is not the case, unpopular régimes survive because they are considered legitimate by a small, influential [[elite|élite]].&lt;ref name="Dahl, Robert A. pp. 124"&gt;Dahl, Robert A. ''Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition'' (pp. 124–188). New Haven (Connecticut) and London: Yale University Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese political philosophy, since the historical period of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1046–256 BC), the political legitimacy of a ruler and government was derived from the [[Mandate of Heaven]], and unjust rulers who lost said mandate therefore lost the right to rule the people.

In [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], the term "legitimacy" is often positively interpreted as the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] status conferred by a governed people upon their governors' institutions, offices, and actions, based upon the belief that their government's actions are appropriate uses of power by a legally constituted government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phelps|first1=Martha Lizabeth|title=Doppelgangers of the State: Private Security and Transferable Legitimacy|journal=Politics &amp; Policy|date=December 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=824–849|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12100/abstract|doi=10.1111/polp.12100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era British social philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) said that political legitimacy derives from popular explicit and implicit [[consent of the governed]]: "The argument of the [''Second''] ''Treatise'' is that the government is not legitimate unless it is carried on with the consent of the governed."&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, Richard (ed.): ''John Locke: Critical Assessments'' (p. 524). London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Dolf Sternberger]] said that "[l]egitimacy is the foundation of such governmental power as is exercised, both with a consciousness on the government's part that it has a right to govern, and with some recognition by the governed of that right".&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, Dolf: "Legitimacy" in ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (ed. D.L. Sills) Vol. 9 (p. 244). New York: Macmillan, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[political sociologist]] [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] said that legitimacy also "involves the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate and proper ones for the society".&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour Martin: ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (2nd ed.) (p. 64). London: Heinemann, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The American political scientist [[Robert A. Dahl]] explained legitimacy as a reservoir: so long as the water is at a given level, political stability is maintained, if it falls below the required level, political legitimacy is endangered.&lt;ref name="Dahl, Robert A. pp. 124"/&gt;

== Types ==

Legitimacy is "a value whereby something or someone is recognized and accepted as right and proper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Jing|title=Useful Complaints: How Petitions Assist Decentralized Authoritarianism in China|year=2016|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|isbn=9781498534536|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In political science, legitimacy usually is understood as the popular acceptance and recognition by the public of the authority of a governing régime, whereby authority has political power through consent and mutual understandings, not coercion. The three types of political legitimacy described by German [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] are traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal:

*Traditional legitimacy derives from societal custom and habit that emphasize the history of the authority of [[tradition]]. Traditionalists understand this form of rule as historically accepted, hence its continuity, because it is the way society has always been. Therefore, the institutions of traditional government usually are historically continuous, as in [[monarchy]] and [[Tribe|tribalism]].
*Charismatic legitimacy derives from the ideas and personal [[charisma]] of the leader, a person whose authoritative [[persona]] charms and psychologically dominates the people of the society to agreement with the government's régime and rule. A charismatic government usually features weak political and administrative institutions, because they derive authority from the persona of the leader, and usually disappear without the leader in power. However, if the charismatic leader has a successor, a government derived from charismatic legitimacy might continue.
*Rational-legal legitimacy derives from a system of institutional procedure, wherein government institutions establish and enforce law and order in the public interest. Therefore, it is through public trust that the government will abide the law that confers rational-legal legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick H.|title=Essentials of Comparative Politics|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-93376-5|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numinous legitimacy ===

{{further|Divine right of kings|Mandate of Heaven|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}

In a [[theocracy]], government legitimacy derives from the spiritual authority of a god or a goddess.

* In [[ancient Egypt]] (c. 3150 BC), the legitimacy of the dominion of a [[Pharaoh]] (god–king) was theologically established by doctrine that posited the pharaoh as the Egyptian patron god [[Horus]], son of [[Osiris]].
[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|150px|right|Theocracy: The coat of arms of the [[Holy See]], the seat of [[Pope|Papal government]].]]
* In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[priest]]hood derives its legitimacy from a divine source; the Roman Magisterium dogmatically teaches that Jesus Christ designated St. Peter the [[universal jurisdiction|supreme]] and [[papal infallibility|infallible]] head of the entire Christian Church, and thus each [[Papacy|bishop of Rome]] is sanctified, legitimate, and possesses these [[charism]]s as well.

=== Civil legitimacy ===
[[File:Women vote in Cairo - 27-May-2014.jpg|left|thumb|One measurement of civil legitimacy is who has access to the vote, including women are able to vote.]]
The political legitimacy of a civil government derives from agreement among the autonomous constituent institutions—legislative, judicial, executive—combined for the national common good. One way civil society grants legitimacy to governments is through public elections. There are also those who refute the legitimacy offered by public elections, pointing out that the amount of legitimacy public elections can grant depends significantly on the electoral system conducting the elections. In the United States this issue has surfaced around how voting is impacted by gerrymandering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/07/06/a-primer-on-gerrymandering-and-political-polarization/|title=A primer on gerrymandering and political polarization|last=Dews|first=Fred|date=2017-07-06|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Shelby County v. Holder|repeal of part of the Voting Rights Act]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html|title=Supreme Court Invalidates Key Part of Voting Rights Act|last=Liptak|first=Adam|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another challenge to the political legitimacy offered by elections is whether or not marginalized groups such as women or those who are incarcerated are allowed to vote.{{fact|date=July 2018}} 

Civil legitimacy can be granted through different measures for accountability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/programs/cri/programs/governance-accountability|title=Governance &amp; Accountability|website=www.hks.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; than voting, such as financial transparency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://financialtransparency.org|title=Home - Financial Transparency Coalition|website=Financial Transparency Coalition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stake-holder accountability. In the international system another method for measuring civil legitimacy is through accountability to international human rights norms.{{fact|date=July 2018}} 

In an effort determine what makes a government legitimate the Center for Public Impact launched a project to hold a global conversation about legitimacy stating, inviting citizens, academics and governments to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findinglegitimacy.centreforpublicimpact.org|title=Finding Legitimacy|website=findinglegitimacy.centreforpublicimpact.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also publishes case studies that consider the theme of legitimacy as it applies to projects in a number of different countries including Bristol, Lebanon and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/insights/?searchString=&amp;theme%5B%5D=legitimacy&amp;orderby=|title=Viewpoints - Centre for Public Impact (CPI)|work=Centre for Public Impact (CPI)|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Good" governance vs. "bad" governance ===
The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commission (OHCHR) established standards of what is considered "good governance" that include the key attributes transparency, responsibility, accountability, participation and responsiveness (to the needs of the people).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/Development/GoodGovernance/Pages/GoodGovernanceIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} 
	Good Governance and Human Rights|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Input, output and throughput legitimacy ===

Assessing the political legitimacy of a government can be done by looking at three different aspects of which a government can derive legitimacy. [[Fritz W. Scharpf|Fritz Scharpf]] introduced two normative criteria, which are output legitimacy, i.e. the effectiveness of policy outcomes for people and input legitimacy, the responsiveness to citizen concerns as a result of participation by the people. A third normative criterion was added by [[Vivien A. Schmidt|Vivien Schmidt]], who analyzes legitimacy also in terms of what she calls throughput, i.e. the governance processes that happen in between input and output.

=== Negative and positive legitimacy ===

Abulof distinguishes between negative political legitimacy (NPL), which is about the object of legitimation (answering ''what'' is legitimate), and positive political legitimacy (PPL), which is about the source of legitimation (answering ''who'' is the 'legitimator').{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} NPL is concerned with establishing where to draw the line between good and bad, PPL with who should be drawing it in the first place. From the NPL perspective, political legitimacy emanates from appropriate actions; from a PPL perspective, it emanates from appropriate actors. In the social contract tradition, Hobbes and Locke focused on NPL (stressing security and liberty, respectively), while Rousseau focused more on PPL ("the people" as the legitimator). Arguably, political stability depends on both forms of legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Abulof"&gt;Abulof, Uriel (2015).

=== Instrumental and substantive legitimacy ===

Weber's understanding of legitimacy rests on shared ''values'', such as tradition and rational-legality. But policies that aim at (re-)constructing legitimacy by improving the service delivery or 'output' of a state often only respond to shared ''needs''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weigand|first=Florian|date=April 2015|title=Investigating the Role of Legitimacy in the Political Order of Conflict-torn Spaces|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/62691/1/Investigating-Legitimacy-in-the-Political-Order-of-Conflict-torn-spaces.pdf|journal=SiT/WP|volume=04/15|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, substantive sources of legitimacy need to be distinguished from more instrumental ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Instrumental legitimacy'' rests on "the rational assessment of the usefulness of an authority ..., describing to what extent an authority responds to shared needs. Instrumental legitimacy is very much based on the perceived effectiveness of service delivery. Conversely, ''substantive legitimacy'' is a more abstract normative judgment, which is underpinned by shared values. If a person believes that an entity has the right to exercise social control, he or she may also accept personal disadvantages."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Max Weber]]: societies are politically cyclical.]] 
Max Weber proposed that societies behave cyclically in governing themselves with different types of governmental legitimacy. That [[democracy]] was unnecessary for establishing legitimacy, a condition that can be established with codified laws, customs, and cultural principles, not by means of [[voting|popular suffrage]]. That a society might decide to revert from the legitimate government of a rational–legal authority to the charismatic government of a leader; e.g., the [[Nazi Germany]] of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Fascism|Fascist]] Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]], and [[Francoist Spain]] under General [[Francisco Franco]].

[[File:matteidoganportrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Mattei Dogan]]]]
The French political scientist [[Mattei Dogan]]'s contemporary interpretation of Weber's types of political legitimacy (traditional, charismatic, legal-rational) proposes that they are conceptually insufficient to comprehend the complex relationships that constitute a legitimate political system in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;Dogan, Mattei: Conceptions of Legitimacy, ''Encyclopedia of Government and Politics'' 2nd edition, Mary Hawkesworth and Maurice Kogan editors, Vol. 2, pp. 116-219. London: Routledge 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Dogan proposed that traditional authority and charismatic authority are obsolete as forms of contemporary government (e.g., the Islamic Republic of Iran (est. 1979) rule by means of the priestly Koranic interpretations by the [[Ayatollah]] [[Khomeini]]). That traditional authority has disappeared in the [[Middle East]]; that the rule-proving exceptions are [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].{{clarify|date=December 2014}}{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Furthermore, the third Weber type of political legitimacy, rational-legal authority, exists in so many permutations no longer allow it to be limited as a type of legitimate authority.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}

== Forms of legitimate government ==

In determining the political legitimacy of a system of rule and government, the term proper—''political legitimacy''—is philosophically an [[essentially contested concept]] that facilitates understanding the different applications and interpretations of abstract, [[Qualitative properties|qualitative]], and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] concepts such as "[[art]]", "[[social justice]]", et cetera, as applied in [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], the [[philosophy of history]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Initially published as Gallie (1956a), then as Gallie (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in defining the political legitimacy of a system of government and rule, the term "essentially contested concept" indicates that a key term ([[communism]], [[democracy]], [[constitutionalism]], etc.) has different meanings within a given political argument. Hence, the intellectually restrictive politics of [[Dogma#Dogma outside of religion|dogmatism]] ("My answer is right, and all others are wrong"), [[scepticism]] ("All answers are equally true or [false]; everyone has a right to his own truth"), and [[eclecticism]] ("Each meaning gives a partial view, so the more meanings the better") are inappropriate philosophic stances for managing a political term that has more than one meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Garver (1978), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[W. B. Gallie|Walter Bryce Gallie]])

Establishing what qualifies as a legitimate form of government continues to be a topic of great philosophical controversy. Forms of legitimate government are posited to include:{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*'''[[Communism]]''': The legitimacy of a [[Communist state]] derives from having won a [[civil war]], a [[revolution]], or from having won an election, such as the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende]] (1970–73) in Chile; thus, the actions of the Communist government are legitimate, authorised by the people. In the early twentieth century, [[Communism|Communist parties]] based the arguments supporting the legitimacy of their rule and government upon the scientific nature of [[Marxism]]. (See [[dialectical materialism]].)
*'''[[Constitutionalism]]''': The modern political concept of constitutionalism establishes the law as supreme over the private will, by integrating [[nationalism]], democracy, and limited government. The political legitimacy of constitutionalism derives from popular belief and acceptance that the actions of the government are legitimate because they abide by the law codified in the [[political constitution]]. The political scientist [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] (1901–84) said that, in dividing political power among the organs of government, constitutional law effectively restrains the actions of the government.&lt;ref name="Charlton, Roger p. 23"&gt;Charlton, Roger: ''Political Realities: Comparative Government'' (p. 23). London: Longman, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[checks and balances]].)
*'''[[Democracy]]''': In a democracy, government legitimacy derives from the popular perception that the elected government abides by democratic principles in governing, and thus is legally accountable to its people.&lt;ref name="Charlton, Roger p. 23"/&gt;
*'''[[Fascism]]''': In the 1920s and the 1930s, fascism based its political legitimacy upon the arguments of traditional authority; respectively, the German [[Nazism|National Socialists]] and the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascists]] claimed that the political legitimacy of their right to rule derived from philosophically denying the (popular) political legitimacy of elected [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[democracy|democratic]] governments. During the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918–33), the political philosopher [[Carl Schmitt]] (1888–1985)—whose legal work as the "Crown Jurist of the Third Reich" promoted fascism and [[Deconstruction|deconstructed]] liberal democracy—addressed the matter in ''Legalität und Legitimität'' (Legality and Legitimacy, 1932), an anti-democratic [[Polemics|polemic]] treatise that asked: How can parliamentary government make for law and legality, when a 49 per cent minority accepts as politically legitimate the political will of a 51 per cent majority?&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Carl: ''Legality and Legitimacy'' (Jeffrey Seitzer translator). Durham (North Carolina): Duke University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Monarchy]]''': In a monarchy, the [[divine right of kings]] establishes the political legitimacy of the rule of the monarch (king or queen); legitimacy also derives from the popular perception (tradition and [[Convention (norm)|custom]]) and acceptance of the monarch as the rightful ruler of nation and country. Contemporarily, such divine-right legitimacy is manifest in the [[absolute monarchy]] of the [[House of Saud]] (est. 1744), a [[royal family]] who have ruled and governed [[Saudi Arabia]] since the 18th century. Moreover, [[constitutional monarchy]] is a variant form of monarchic political legitimacy which combines traditional authority and legal–rational authority, by which means the monarch maintains nationalist unity (one people) and democratic administration (a political constitution).

{{taxation}}
The '''Leibzoll''' ([[German language|German]]: "body tax") was a special [[tariff|toll]] which Jews had to pay in most of the European states in the [[Middle Ages]] and up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.

== Rate of the toll ==

The origin of the Leibzoll may be traced to the political position of the Jews in Germany, where they were considered crown property and, therefore, under the king's protection. In his capacity as [[Holy Roman emperor]] the king claimed the exclusive rights of the jurisdiction and taxation of the Jews, and retained responsibility for the protection of their lives and their property. He granted them protection either by a guard or by safe-conduct; chiefly by the latter, for the Jews, being extensive travelers, when they went on long business trips could not always be accompanied by imperial guards. The first instance of the granting of one of these safe-conducts occurred under [[Louis le Débonnaire]] (814–840), and a specimen of it may be found among the documents preserved in the "[[formulary (medieval)|Liber Formularum]]" of that period. According to this document the king grants freedom of travel and exemption from all taxes to three Jews of Lyons "neque teloneum, neque paravereda aut mansionaticum, aut pulveraticum, aut cespitaticum, aut ripaticum, aut rotaticum, aut portaticum, aut herbaticum prædictis Hebræis exigere præsumant" (De Rozières, "Recueil Général des Formules Usitées dans l'Empire des Francs," i. 41–43, Paris, 1859–1871; Simson, "Jahrbücher des Fränkischen Reiches Unter Ludwig, dem Frommen," i. 393–396, Leipsic, 1874–76). For such a safe-conduct the Jews were required to pay a certain fee; but this, being understood, is not stated anywhere, as the payment constitutes the only reason for the exemption from other taxes. The stipulations regulating the tolls of Raffelstetten, {{Interlanguage link multi|Lorch (Oberösterreich)|de}}, issued between 904–906, are to be interpreted in the same manner—the Jews, as privileged merchants, shall not pay more than the regular toll ("justum theloneum"). The law expressly states this conforms with the ancient custom ([[Pertz]], "Mon. Germaniæ Leges," iii. 480; [[Georg Waitz]], "Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte", iv. 1, 70, Kiel, 1884; Scherer, "Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden," p. 110, Leipsic, 1901); the same is stated in the charter granted to the Jews of Worms, 1090 ("Zeitschrift für die Gesch. der Juden in Deutschland," i. 139). When the Jews passed under the jurisdiction of the territorial rulers, this principle was acknowledged. [[Frederick II of Austria]], in his law on the Jews, issued 1244, decreed that within the limits of his state they should not pay more than the legal rate of toll—the same rate that all other citizens had to pay (Scherer, l.c. p. 181). As in the stipulations regulating the {{Interlanguage link multi|tolls of Raffelstetten|de|3=Raffelstettener Zollordnung}}, and as in the law of Frederick II, only customs duties for goods or slaves were mentioned: therefore a personal tax was unknown.

As the Jews in increasing numbers passed under territorial jurisdiction, the exemption from personal tax, which was granted them as long as they remained crown property, was no longer respected, for each territorial ruler considered himself entitled to levy taxes on all foreign Jewish subjects who passed through his territory. But these taxes continued as customs duties until, with the growing hostility of the free cities, and with the frequent expulsion from vast territories which became the rule in the fifteenth century, those rulers who had expelled the Jews from their domains determined on the adoption of a policy of keeping them away from their borders. International relations, however, would not permit of the disregard of a passport granted by a foreign ruler to one of his subjects, so when Jews visited a territory in which no Jew was permitted to settle they were subjected to the payment of a toll.

== Development of Leibzoll ==

Owing to the weakness of the imperial power of the Holy Roman Empire, Jews expelled from a place could easily settle in the vicinity, and on the strength of their passports do business in the place from which they had been expelled. So the Jews expelled from [[Nuremberg]] in 1499 settled in [[Fürth]]; those expelled from [[Nördlingen]] (1507) settled in {{Interlanguage link multi|Kleinerdlingen|de}}; those who could not gain entrance into the city of [[Lübeck]] settled in the village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Lübeck-Moisling|de}}—all places of settlement within easy walking distance of the cities in which they were denied residence. On the passports issued to them by their respective sovereigns they could engage in trade in the latter places, at least during the day, and, therefore, since the local governments wished to enforce the decrees excluding the Jews, they were driven to adopt new measures ("R. E. J." viii. 212). Administrators soon recognized the financial utility of the Leibzoll, and the territorial rulers in the German empire levied such a toll from all traveling Jews, whether foreigners or their own subjects. In Nuremberg the average annual value of the toll for the last ten years during which Leibzoll was levied (1797–1806) was 2,448 [[South German gulden|florins]] (Barbeck, "Gesch. der Juden in Nürnberg und Fürth," p. 106, Nuremberg, 1878).

The wording of the laws sometimes also suggests an intention of humiliating the Jews. For example, an ordinance of [[Philip V of Spain]] (1703) fixes the toll for a wagon-load of merchandise, one head of cattle, or one Jew, when passing over the bridges of [[Luxembourg]], at four [[sols]] ("R. E. J." viii. 208). Sometimes the humiliation lay in the form in which the tax was levied. In some places a Jew passing a toll-gate had to cast dice in remembrance of the crucifixion (Grätz, "Gesch." 3d ed., viii. 14); elsewhere, as in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]], in [[Saxony]], Jews were forced to pay for a guard to follow them as long as they remained within the city. Even after the Leibzoll had been officially abolished, as in Austria by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1782, Jews entering Vienna or staying there for some time had to pay a special tax which differed from Leibzoll only in name. The same may be said of Nuremberg, where Leibzoll was abolished theoretically in 1800, but was levied practically until 1806 under the name of "Passier- und Eintrittsgeld". In [[Warsaw]], where the French government had emancipated the Jews, the Russian government re-introduced the Leibzoll under the name of "Tagzettel", requiring every Jew entering the city to pay five silver [[groschen]] for the first day and three for every additional day he remained ("Allg. Zeit. des Jud." 1862, p. 12).

== Exemptions ==

Certain exemptions from Leibzoll were granted. Under the Austrian law of 1244, corpses were exempt. [[Albert III, Duke of Austria]] gave free safe-conduct to three Austrian Jews to bring "[[Etrog|etrogim]]" from [[Triest]] free of duty in 1389 (Scherer, l.c. p. 535). The Jews living within the territory of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Elector of Mayence]] were exempted from Leibzoll when they were traveling to attend one of the regular landtags, or to meetings of the district congregations (see Bamberger, "Histor. Berichte über die Juden der Stadt Aschaffenburg," p. 26, Strasburg, 1900). As a mark of special favor, court Jews or [[Mentha|mint]]-farmers were exempt from the payment of such tolls (see [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]]). Later the exemption was extended to manufacturers; and [[Hirsch David]], [[velvet]]-manufacturer of Berlin, was exempted by the king (1731) because his business required him to travel frequently ("Allg. Zeit. des Jud." 1902, p. 477). When Meyerbeer went to Vienna, the "Judenamt" received orders to treat him "not as a Jew, but as a cavalier" (ib. 1847, p. 91). Native Jews were often exempted, for a fixed sum, from paying this toll, but naturally this freed them from it only within the confines of their own country. Thus the Jews of Saxony were exempt from the Leibzoll by an order dated 16 April 1773 (Levy, "Geschichte der Juden in Sachsen," p. 71, Berlin, 1901). The Jews of Berlin compromised with the elector, in 1700, by paying 1,000 [[ducats]] annually; this sum ("Jüdische Presse," 22 Aug. 1902) exempted only those who were in the possession of a lawful charter ("Schutzbrief"), which had replaced the old safe-conduct ("Judengeleit"), and who therefore were called "vergleitete Juden" or ''escorted Jews''.

In December, 1787, [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of [[Prussia]] abolished the Leibzoll in Berlin, and in July, 1788, he abolished it in other places. The abolition of the toll was due largely to the exertions of [[David Friedländer]]. In 1791 the [[Bishop of Salzburg]] also abolished the toll in his own dominions.

Notwithstanding the liberal spirit which these abolitions showed, the majority of the German states still clung to the tax. With the advent of the French, however, some of them were compelled to abolish the Leibzoll. Early in July, 1798, the French general Cacatte informed the members of the government at [[Nassau-Usingen]] that, at the order of the division commander Freitag, the special taxes of the Jews were to be abolished, as they were repugnant to justice and humanity. In consequence of this order the Jews on the left bank of the [[Rhine]] were relieved from the payment of Leibzoll. At the conclusion of the [[peace of Lunéville]] (21 July 1801) the toll was re-imposed.

== Wolf Breidenbach ==

At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Jews of Germany found a courageous champion in {{Interlanguage link multi|Wolf Breidenbach|de}}, who worked persistently for the abolition of this impost. Perceiving that ample resources would be required to carry on his campaign, and not being personally able to command these, he invoked the aid of the German and foreign Jews in 1803, asking them to subscribe to the fund raised for this purpose. He instituted negotiations with the minor German princes at the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|Diet of Ratisbon]] (1804), and, aided by [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg|Dalberg]], the imperial chancellor, succeeded in obtaining free passage for the Jews throughout the Rhine provinces and [[Bavaria]]. It was largely due to his efforts that the Leibzoll was abolished in [[Kurhessen]], [[Hohenlohe]], [[Neuwied]], [[Wied-Runkel]], [[Braunfels]], [[Solms-Rödelheim]], and also in [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]] (September, 1806). The emancipation of the Jews from these imposts created much antagonism; and among those opposed to it were such men as Paalzow, Grattenauer, and Buchholz. In the northern [[Hanse]] towns the French garrisons compelled the burghers to relieve the Jews from the payment of the Leibzoll, and, notwithstanding much opposition, secured the privilege for the Jews of [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]], and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. The Leibzoll was abolished in [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] 23 April 1823, through the efforts of [[Israel Jacobson]], court agent to the [[Duke of Brunswick]]. Although the tax had been almost universally abolished, its collection still continued from the Jews visiting [[Vienna]] in the reign (1804–1835) of [[Francis I of Austria]]. Of the German states, [[Saxony]] was the last to abolish it.

== Russia ==

Up to 1862 the Polish Jews visiting [[Russia]] were treated as foreigners, and as such were not admitted into the interior of the empire. On the other hand, the Russian Jews had great difficulty in entering Poland, and those who went there for business had to pay a "Geleitzoll." In 1826 the representatives of the Jewish community of [[Kovno]] petitioned the government for the abolition of the tax, which amounted then to fifteen [[Polish florins]]. By order of Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] this application was referred to the [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich]], then [[Viceroy]] of Poland, who stated that he considered the abolition of the tax inexpedient, but proposed decreasing its amount and regulating it according to age, sex, and business occupation. He deemed it advisable to introduce a similar tax in Russia, and suggested that each Polish Jew entering Russia, and each Russian Jew entering Poland, should be supplied with a pass descriptive of the place of its issuance, the bearer's business, etc. The local police was to be charged with the inspection of the passes. In consequence of this report, Emperor Nicholas ordered the minister of finance to communicate with the proper authorities, and to draft the regulations for the introduction of the tax in question. After a prolonged correspondence with the Polish authorities the minister found the proposed measure to be inexpedient, not only because of the decrease in the revenues which it would effect, but also because of possible complications and abuses in its enforcement. The "Geleitzoll", therefore, remained until abolished by an [[ukase]] of 24 May 1862.

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J. Richard Piper, ''Ideologies and Institutions: American Conservative and Liberal Governance Prescriptions Since 1933'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u93Mj3A-tH8C&amp;pg=PA110 pp. 110–111], {{ISBN|0847684598}}, {{ISBN|978-0847684595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting [[civil society]] through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/getting-libertarianism-right Getting Libertarianism Right]. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. {{ISBN|978-1-61016-690-4}}. [[Mises Institute]] Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|title=The Rise of the City: 1878-1898|publisher=The Academy of Political Science|date=September 1933|orig-year=1st pub. 1933|pages=454–456|chapter=Vol. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Randall|title=Sandino's Daughters: Testimonies of Nicaraguan Women in Struggle|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 14, 2018|orig-year=1st pub. 1995|pages=ii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Carey (Editor), ''Freedom &amp; Virtue: The Conservative Libertarian Debate,'' Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882926-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker. Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/mafaldo1.html|title=The Conservative Case for Ron Paul|last=Mafaldo|first=Lucas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] have been described as combining libertarian and conservative "[[small government]]" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

Since [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] gained [[Indian independence movement|independence]] in 1947, the [[All-India Muslim League]]  and its successor [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] has seen a steady number of splits and breakaway factions. Some of the breakaway organisations have thrived as [[Independent (politician)|independent]] parties, some have become [[wikt:Defunct|defunct]], while others have merged with the parent party or other  political parties. The All-India Muslim League was dissolved in 1947 after the partition. Muslim League (Pakistan) was dissolved in 1958 (by martial law).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5983">The '''Lowry Tapes''' refers to a 2013 scandal in Ireland involving the [[Tipperary North (Dáil constituency)|Tipperary North]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Michael Lowry]], formerly a [[Fine Gael]] government minister. They feature a telephone conversation between Lowry and the land agent Kevin Phelan. The conversation featured foul language and reference to an undeclared payment of €250,000. It is believed to date from 30 September 2004 and raised uncertainty over whether Lowry had misled the [[Moriarty Tribunal]] which had previously investigated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=98152 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130702082643/http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=98152 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 July 2013 |title=Lowry tape broadcast |work=TV3 News |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the controversy focused on the following comments by Lowry:&lt;ref name=journal_conversation_aired_on_national_tv/&gt;
{{cquote|I'm asking you, Kevin, for fuck's sake will you protect me just a small bit. For jaysus sake don't land me in it. I'm destroyed as it fucking is. … I can't bring out that 200 – that 250 – again. If that comes out again I'm fucking ruined, I'm bankrupt. … They can't find that 200. I never declared it.}}

{{cquote|Now, the 2500 – the 250 – that I gave you, I paid that directly. I never put that through my books or my account of anything, nobody's going to fucking get it, so I've got, you, know, I mean, I'm not even bringing that into it.}}

Journalist Michael Clifford, writing in the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'', drew comparisons between the response - or lack thereof - from the Irish government and the British government's past responses to tamer crimes such as [[Jeffrey Archer]]'s perjury and [[Chris Huhne]]'s perverting the course of justice. Clifford wrote that the Lowry scandal "tells us much about what passes for democracy in this State. [It] involves ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence that at least one crime may have been committed by serving TD and former government minister, Michael Lowry. In a proper democracy [...] this would be a matter for the police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Clifford|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/michael-clifford/lowry-and-inaction-of-gardarevenue-228210.html|title=Lowry and inaction of Garda/Revenue|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=13 April 2013|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' published a transcript of the Lowry Tapes; however state broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s coverage was roundly criticised and deemed inadequate. The ''Sunday Independent'' said RTÉ's self-censorship had become the story and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' featured a piece captioned "Our state broadcaster must learn to confront, not cower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eoghan|last=Harris|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/eoghan-harris/rtes-silence-over-lowry-tapes-is-now-the-story-29150350.html|title=RTÉ's silence over Lowry tapes is now the story|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=24 March 2013|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/rte-defends-coverage-of-the-lowry-tapes-851924-Mar2013/|title=RTÉ defends coverage of the ‘Lowry Tapes’|work=TheJournal.ie|date=31 March 2013|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few mentions was provided by [[Marian Finucane]], one of RTÉ's highest earners, who brushed over the Lowry Tapes in two minutes at the end of her show when one of her panelists brought up the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eilis|last=O'Hanlon|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/eilis-ohanlon-you-cant-find-time-to-discuss-lowry-the-public-begs-to-differ-29194820.html|title=You can't find time to discuss Lowry – the public begs to differ|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=14 April 2013|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Morning Ireland]]'' preferred to focus its political coverage on what were termed more trivial topics, such as [[Luke 'Ming' Flanagan]]'s driving technique and tweets by [[Gerry Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John-Paul|last=McCarthy|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/johnpaul-mccarthy-montrose-fails-to-see-value-in-lowry-story-29135186.html|title=Montrose fails to see value in Lowry story: John-Paul McCarthy ponders the passive reaction of both the Government and RTÉ to the Lowry tapes|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=17 March 2013|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">In politics, a '''martyr''' is someone who suffers persecution and/or death for advocating, renouncing, refusing to renounce, and/or refusing to advocate a political belief or cause.

The [[Manchester Martyrs]] were three Irishmen executed after being condemned for association with the killing of a policeman in [[Manchester]], England in 1867. The day after the executions, [[Frederick Engels]] wrote to [[Karl Marx]]: "Yesterday morning the Tories, by the hand of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the [[Fenians]] still lacked were martyrs. ... To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent."&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels in Ireland (1971) Progress Publishers, Moscow. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867/letters/67_11_24.htm Letter of November 24 1867 Engels to Marx]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]] were a group of 19th century agricultural labourers in [[Dorset]], England, who were arrested for and convicted of swearing a secret oath as members of the ''Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers.'' The rules of the society showed it was clearly structured as a [[friendly society]], that is, a mutual association for the purposes of insurance, pensions, savings or cooperative banking; and it operated as a trade-specific [[benefit society]]. But at the time, friendly societies had strong elements of what are now considered to be the principal role of [[trade union]]s, and wages were at issue. The Tolpuddle Martyrs were sentenced not to death but to [[penal transportation|transportation]] to [[Australia]], a harsh form of exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/TolpuddleMartyrs.htm |title=The Tolpuddle Martyrs |publisher=Historic-uk.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Belfiore martyrs]] (in [[italian language|Italian]], ''Martiri di Belfiore'') were a group of [[Italy|Italian]] pro-independence fighters condemned to death by hanging in 1853 during the Italian Risorgimento.
They included [[Tito Speri]] and the priest [[Enrico Tazzoli (priest)|Enrico Tazzoli]] and are named after the site where the sentence was carried out, in the valley of Belfiore at the south entrance to [[Mantua]].

Many [[communist]] activists have died as martyrs in India, due to their allegiance to various communist parties, such as the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(M)]] and the [[Communist Party of India|CPI]]. Most of them hail from mainly [[leftist]] states such as [[Kerala]], and [[Tripura]]. In Kerala, many are killed in protests by the police, and some are assassinated by activists in other political parties, such as the [[Indian National Congress|INC]] and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The district of [[Kannur district|Kannur]] has reported to have had the most political murders. Here, the RSS are known to have used brutal violence to eliminate CPI(M) workers.

Other notable martyrs include:
* 1965 &amp;ndash; [[Malcolm X]], assassinated due to his leadership in [[Black Nationalism]]
* 1968 &amp;ndash; [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], assassinated for his leadership of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]
* 1981 &amp;ndash; [[Bobby Sands]], an Irish Republican who died on hunger strike while imprisoned

'''Minoritarianism''' is a [[neologism]] for a political structure or process in which a minority segment of a population has a certain degree of primacy in that entity's [[decision making]].&lt;ref&gt; https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/Fhu5gJzl3u4LwuErXoJxFO/Majority-minority-authority.html&lt;/ref&gt; Minoritarianism may be contrasted with [[majoritarianism]], but with legislative power being held or controlled by a minority group rather than the majority.

==Concept in depth==
Minoritarianism is most often applied disparagingly to processes in which a minority is able to block legislative changes through [[supermajority]] threshold requirements.  For example, if a 2/3 vote in favor is required to enact a new law, a minority of greater than 1/3 is said to have "minoritarian" powers.

Even in the case where minority control is nominally limited to blocking the majority with [[veto]] power (whether as a result of a supermajority requirement or a consensus process), this may result in the situation where the minority retains effective control over the group's agenda and the nature of the proposals submitted to the group, as the majority will not propose ideas that they know the minority will veto.

Critics of this use of ''minoritarianism'' argue that the ability to block legislation is substantially different from the ability to enact new legislation against the will of the majority, making the analogy to unpopular "dominant minority rule" examples inappropriate.

Minoritarianism is sometimes used to describe rule by a [[dominant minority]] such as an [[ethnic group]] delineated by [[religion]], [[language]] or some other identifying factor.  Historical examples included [[Rhodesia]] (now called [[Zimbabwe]]) under [[Ian Smith]] and [[South Africa under apartheid]] rule and some would say after apartheid rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://johnpilger.com/articles/south-africa-20-years-of-apartheid-by-another-name [[John Pilger]] Apartheid by another name&lt;/ref&gt;

Minoritarianism may also be used to describe some cases where appeasement of [[minorities]] by [[Votebank|votebank politics]] is practiced.  Examples include, but are not limited to, Indian Muslims, Jewish Americans, and Francophone Canadians.

==In small deliberative groups==
Supermajority decision threshold requirements are often found in small deliberative groups where these requirements are sometimes adopted in an attempt to increase protection of varied interests within the group.  The requirements may be formally stated or may be unstated (for example, when an organization is described as having a "consensus culture").  

A common criticism of [[consensus decision-making]] is that it can lead to a situation wherein a minority can block the will of the majority.  Consensus advocates argue that this is a good feature&amp;mdash;that ''no action'' is preferable to one without the consensus support of the group.

Attempts to resolve the dilemma through formal supermajority standards are generally discouraged by parliamentary authorities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people have mistakenly assumed that the higher the vote required to take an action, the greater the protection of the members. Instead the opposite is true. Whenever a vote of more than a majority is required to take an action, control is taken from the majority and given to the minority. ... The higher the vote required, the smaller the minority to which control passes. &lt;br/&gt;
— from "The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure" by [[Alice Sturgis]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5THFbCnDdbIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''National reactions to the Gaza flotilla raid''' on 31 May 2010 ranged from ranged from support to strong condemnation of Israel. Those supporting Israel generally also expressed concern for the loss of life and injuries to civilians. Criticism included the death and injuries of civilians, the disproportionate response, and the execution of the raid.

[[Bloomberg News]] (4 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He further noted that in five of the six vessels in the flotilla, the boarding procedure ended without casualties. "The only difference was with one ship, where extremist Islamic activists, supporters of terrorism, waited for our troops on the deck with axes and knives."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/05/israel-rachel-corrie-gaza-ship "Israeli forces board the Rachel Corrie"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After the boarding took place, Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] said that the flotilla of ships "was an armada of hate and violence". He added that the flotilla attempt to reach Gaza was "a premeditated and outrageous provocation" and claimed that its organizers had ties not only to [[Hamas]], but also to global [[Jihadism|Jihad]], and [[al Qaida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=176998 | newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | title=Barak: Flotilla organizers to blame | date=31 May 2010 | accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] called the international community "two faced" and said Israel was being condemned for its military acts of defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shamir |first=Shlomo |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/lieberman-to-un-chief-international-community-is-two-faced-for-condemning-israel-1.293299 |title=Lieberman to UN chief: International community is two-faced for condemning Israel |work=[[Haaretz]] |location=Israel |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieberman was said to have been "reminding" the UN Secretary General that in the past month alone over 500 people were killed in various incidents in Thailand, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and [[Indo-Israeli relations|India]], which had allegedly been "ignored" while Israel was being condemned for its "unmistakably defensive actions". Israel later rescinded its criticism of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/73116/israel-drops-indias-name-list.html "Israel drops India's name from the list of violence hit nations"]. ''[[Deccan Herald]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition leader [[Tzipi Livni]] said that the coalition and the opposition are united in support of the defense forces, and that she is ready to assist the government in the political and explanatory aspects of the flotilla incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3896557,00.html "Livni offers help: In defending IDF there is no coalition, opposition"]. [[Ynetnews]] (20 June 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; She, however, disagreed with what she considered Netanyahu's lack of policy: "The world is certainly hypocritical, but that doesn't absolve us from forming a policy. This is more than an isolated incident. Anything that happened when Israel had a different standing in world opinion would have had a different result. Now, any isolated incident becomes a global drama, and it's becoming worse. We are reaching the stage when Israel's ability to defend itself will no longer exist." She said the lack of policy in the aftermath of the incident would jeopardize Israel's legitimacy and backing from the international community, which she says for years had insisted on not recognizing Hamas until it recognizes Israel and accepts past agreements, and had accepted the closure of Gaza while "it was clear that Israel wanted an agreement with pragmatic forces, with the legitimate Palestinian government." She also said that IDF soldiers acted appropriately, and supports setting up an internal investigation committee with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898602,00.html |title=Livni: Keep world from investigating IDF soldiers |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambassador to the U.K., [[Ron Prosor]], said: "It's obvious – and I won't beat around the bush on this – that this wasn't successful and I think it clearly took up an issue that should have been solved differently." [However, the] other side [behaved] appallingly. [Israel was in a] war situation with terrorists. The loss of life was tragic and I’m not just saying that.

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|Elevation]], [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|section]] and [[Multiview orthographic projection#Plan|plan]] of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon penitentiary, drawn by [[Willey Reveley]], 1791]]
The '''Panopticon''' is a type of institutional building and a system of control designed by the English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late 18th century. The scheme of the design is to allow all (''pan-'') [[inmate]]s of an institution to be observed (''-opticon'') by a single watchman without the inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all the inmates' cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that they are motivated to act as though they are being watched at all times. Thus, they are effectively compelled to regulate their own behaviour. The name may also allude to the many-eyed giant [[Panoptes]] in [[Greek mythology]], some of whose eyes were always awake, making him a highly effective watchman.

The design consists of a circular structure with an "inspection house" at its centre, from which the manager or staff of the institution is able to watch the inmates. The inmates, who are stationed around the perimeter of the structure, are unable to see into the inspection house. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, and asylums, but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a Panopticon prison. It is his prison that is now most widely meant by the term "panopticon".

Bentham described the Panopticon as "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example".{{Sfn |Bentham |1843d |p=39}} Elsewhere, in a letter, he described the Panopticon prison as "a mill for grinding rogues honest".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Works |volume=10. Memoirs Part I and Correspondence |year=1843 |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |publisher=Liberty fund |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/bentham-the-works-of-jeremy-bentham-vol-10-memoirs-part-i-and-correspondence?q=a+mill+for+grinding+rogues+honest#Bentham_0872-10_1504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual history ==
{{quote |Morals reformed—health preserved—industry invigorated—instruction diffused—public burthens lightened—Economy seated, as it were, upon a rock—the [[Gordian Knot]] of the [[Poor Law|poor-law]] not cut, but untied—all by a simple idea in Architecture!{{Sfn | Bentham | 1843d | p = 39}}}}

In 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to [[Krychaw|Krichev]] in White Russia (modern [[Belarus]]) to visit his brother, [[Samuel Bentham|Samuel]], who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for [[Grigory Potemkin|Prince Potemkin]]. It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Prisons and prison systems: a global encyclopedia| first = Mitchel P | last = Roth |year= 2006 |publisher=Greenwood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTH31DgbTzgC&amp;pg=PA33|page= 33| isbn = 9780313328565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–101}}  He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of ''contract management''; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a [[pecuniary]] interest in lowering the average rate of mortality.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 134–40}}

The Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; "Allow me to construct a prison on this model," Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, "I will be the [[gaoler]]. You will see&amp;nbsp;... that the gaoler will have no salary—will cost nothing to the nation." As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched.  According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour, walking on wheels to spin [[loom]]s or run a [[water wheel]]. This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.{{Sfn | Bentham | 1995 | pages = 29–95}}

== Abortive prison project ==
On his return to England from Russia, Bentham continued to work on the idea of a Panopticon prison, and commissioned drawings from an architect, [[Willey Reveley]].{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | p = 118}}  In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor-governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France,&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 102–4, 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; he started trying to persuade the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a Panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid £2,000 for preliminary work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 108–10, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intended site was one that had been authorised (under an [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1760–1779|act]] of 1779) for the earlier Penitentiary, at [[Battersea]] Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 169–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near [[Woolwich]], but all proved unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 194–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near [[Westminster]]. Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including [[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Earl Grosvenor]], who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 197–217.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at [[Millbank]], adjoining the [[River Thames|Thames]], was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for £12,000 in November 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 217–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison—which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the Panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 226–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]] administration decided not to proceed with the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 236–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham was devastated: "They have murdered my best days."&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a Panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 265–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly £700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of £23,000.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 279–81.&lt;/ref&gt; An Act of Parliament in 1812 transferred his title in the site to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Penitentiary House, etc. Act: 52 Geo. III, c. 44 (1812).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the Panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. It was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of "sinister interest"—that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest—which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Schofield |title=Bentham: a guide for the perplexed |year=2009 |place=London |publisher= Continuum |isbn=978-0-8264-9589-1 |pages= 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Millbank Prison|National Penitentiary]] was indeed subsequently built on the Millbank site, but to a design by William Williams that owed little to the Panopticon, beyond the fact that the governor's quarters, administrative offices, and chapel were placed at the centre of the complex. It opened in 1816.

Although most prison designs have included elements of surveillance, the essential elements of Bentham's design were not only that the custodians should be able to view the prisoners at all times (including times when they were in their cells), but also that the prisoners should be unable to see the custodians, and so could never be sure whether or not they were under surveillance. This objective was extremely difficult to achieve within the constraints of the available technology, which explains why Bentham spent so many years reworking his plans.  Subsequent 19th-century prison designs enabled the custodians to keep the doors of cells and the outsides of buildings under observation, but not to see the prisoners in their cells. Something close to a realization of Bentham's vision only became possible through 20th-century technological developments—notably [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV)—but these eliminated the need for a specific architectural framework.

It has been argued that the Panopticon influenced the radial design of 19th-century prisons built on the principles of the "[[separate system]]" (including [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in [[Philadelphia]], opened in 1829, and the later [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] in London and [[Armagh Women's Prison|Armagh Gaol]] in Northern Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrzejewski |first= Anna Vemer |title= Building Power: Architecture and Surveillance in Victorian America |place= Knoxville |publisher= University of Tennessee Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-57233631-5 |pages= 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these prisons control was exercised through strict prisoner isolation rather than surveillance, but they also incorporated a design of radiating wings, allowing a centrally located guard to observe the door of every cell.

===Claimed influence===
As noted, none of these prisons—with the arguable exceptions mentioned above—are true Panopticons in the Benthamic sense. In some cases, the claims for any influence are very dubious indeed, and seem to be based on little more than the fact that (for example) the design is circular.

Bentham always conceived the Panopticon principle as being beneficial to the design of a variety of institutions in which surveillance was important, including hospitals, schools, workhouses, and lunatic asylums, as well as prisons.

A wooden Panopticon factory, capable of holding 5000 workers, was constructed by [[Samuel Bentham]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], on the banks of the [[Neva River]], between 1805 and 1808: its purpose was to educate and employ young men in trades connected with the navy. It burned down in 1818.{{Sfn|Semple|1993|pp=214–5.}} The Round Mill in [[Belper]], Derbyshire, England, is supposed to have been built on the Panopticon principle with a central overseer. Designed by [[William Strutt (inventor)|William Strutt]], and constructed in 1811, it had fallen into disuse by the beginning of the 20th century and was demolished in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farmer |first=Adrian |title=Belper and Milford |publisher=Tempus |place=Stroud |year=2004 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Worcester State Hospital]], Massachusetts, USA, constructed in the late 19th century, extensively employed panoptic structures to allow more efficient observation of the wards. It was considered a model facility at the time.

The Panopticon has been suggested as an "open" hospital architecture:

The [[Akron Plan]] common in American Protestant church buildings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is based on similar principles to the panopticon, although there is no evidence of direct influence.

[[File:Contrasted Residences for the Poor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"Contrasted Residences for the Poor": a plate from [[Augustus Pugin]]'s ''Contrasts'' (1841)]]
Despite the fact that no Panopticon was built during Bentham's lifetime (and virtually none since), his concept has prompted considerable discussion and debate. Whereas Bentham himself regarded the Panopticon as a rational, enlightened, and therefore just, solution to societal problems, his ideas have been repeatedly criticised by others for their reductive, mechanistic and inhumane approach to human lives. Thus, in 1841, [[Augustus Pugin]] published the second edition of his work ''[[Augustus Pugin#Contrasts|Contrasts]]'' in which one plate showed a "Modern Poor House" (clearly modelled on a Panopticon), a bleak and comfortless structure in which the pauper is separated from his family, subjected to a harsh discipline, fed on a minimal diet, and consigned after death to medical dissection, contrasted with an "Antient Poor House", an architecturally inspiring religious institution in which the pauper is treated throughout with humanity and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Margaret |last= Belcher |chapter=Pugin Writing |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last= Atterbury |editor2-first= Clive |editor2-last=Wainwright |title=Pugin: a Gothic Passion |publisher=Yale University Press |place= London |year= 1994 |isbn=0-30006012-2 |pages=105–16 (108–9) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, American historian [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] published an essay, "The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham", in which she depicted Bentham's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gertrude |last= Himmelfarb |authorlink=Gertrude Himmelfarb |chapter=The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham |editor1-first= Richard |editor1-last= Herr |editor2-first=Harold T. |editor2-last=Parker |title=Ideas in History: essays presented to Louis Gottschalk by his former students |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham, NC |year= 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel arguments were put forward by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] in an essay entitled "Le despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham", written in 1973 and published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacques-Alain |last= Miller |authorlink= Jacques-Alain Miller |trans-title=The despotism of the useful: Jeremy Bentham’s panoptical machine | title=La despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham | language = fr | journal=Ornicar? |volume=3 |year=1975 |pages= 3–36}}; published in English as {{cite journal |first= Jacques-Alain |last= Miller |authorlink= Jacques-Alain Miller |title= Jeremy Bentham's Panoptic Device |journal= October |volume= 41 |year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Martin |last= Jay |authorlink= Martin Jay |title=Downcast eyes: the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought |place= Berkeley |publisher= University of California Press |year= 1993 |isbn= 0-52008154-4 |pages= 381–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most influentially, the idea of the panopticon was invoked by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975), as a metaphor for modern "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise. This means that the Panopticon operates as a power mechanism. "On the whole, therefore, one can speak of the formation of a disciplinary society in this movement that stretches from the enclosed disciplines, a sort of social 'quarantine', to an indefinitely generalizable mechanism of 'panopticism'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foucault|1995|pp=195–210}}: quotation at p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The Panopticon is an ideal architectural figure of modern disciplinary power which Foucault proposes had existed before it was named as such. Foucault references quarantine procedures in response to the plague at the end of the seventeenth century, which predate the model of the panopticon but resemble the control dynamic closely. A plague-ridden town would be partitioned, then each house would be locked with guards on each street end in a similar design to the later-theorized panopticon. The Panopticon creates a consciousness of permanent visibility as a form of power, where no bars, chains, and heavy locks are necessary for domination any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Thomas |last=Allmer |year=2012 |title=Towards a Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism |place=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |page=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of actual surveillance, the mere threat of surveillance is what disciplines society into behaving according to rules and norms. Furthermore, the spectator of the panopticon changes in Foucault's account, for the idea that fellow people are watching and spectating reinforces the disciplinary society. Foucault proposes that not only prisons but all [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures like the army, schools, hospitals and factories have evolved through history to resemble Bentham's Panopticon. The notoriety of the design today (although not its lasting influence in architectural realities) stems from Foucault's famous analysis of it.

[[File:CCTV graffiti - geograph.org.uk - 977154.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Anti-CCTV graffiti]]
Building on Foucault, contemporary social critics often assert that technology has allowed for the deployment of panoptic structures invisibly throughout society. [[Surveillance]] by [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras in public spaces is an example of a technology that brings the gaze of a superior into the daily lives of the populace. Furthermore, a number of cities in the United Kingdom, including Middlesbrough, Bristol, Brighton and London have added loudspeakers to a number of their existing CCTV cameras. They can transmit the voice of a camera supervisor to issue audible messages to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint/092206/view4.cfm | title = Cameras Help Stop Crime | newspaper = The Hoya | date = 22 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/09/351051.html | title = 2006, But Has 1984 Finally Arrived? | publisher = Indymedia | place = UK | date = 19 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, critical analyses of internet practice have suggested that the internet allows for a panoptic form of observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://theoryandscience.icaap.org/content/vol003.001/brignall.html | title = The New Panopticon: The Internet Viewed as a Structure of Social Control | journal = Theory &amp; science | volume = 3 | number = 1 | publisher = ICAAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Service Providers|ISP]]s are able to track users' activities, while user-generated content means that daily social activity may be recorded and broadcast online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mobimundi.net/ | title=Workshop: Exploring the Impact of User-generated Mobile Content – The Participatory Panopticon | publisher = Mobi mundi | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311061007/http://mobimundi.net/ | deadurl=yes| archivedate= 11 March 2012| accessdate= 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shoshana Zuboff]] used the metaphor of the panopticon in her book ''In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power'' (1988) to describe how computer technology makes work more visible. Zuboff examined how computer systems were used to track the behavior and output of workers. She used the term panopticon because the workers could not tell that they were being spied on, while the manager was able to check their work continuously. As the book was written in 1988, Zuboff's arguments were based on the online information service [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]] rather than the [[World Wide Web]]. Zuboff argued that there is a collective responsibility formed by the hierarchy in the Information Panopticon that eliminates subjective opinions and judgements of managers on their employees. Because each employee's contribution to the production process is translated into objective data, it becomes more important for managers to be able to analyze the work rather than analyze the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power | first = Shoshana | last = Zuboff |year=1988 | place =New York | publisher = Basic Books | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/227065/mod_resource/content/1/zuboff_info_panopticon.pdf |pages= 315–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1998 essay, "The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963–1997", academic [[Juan Cole]] compares the [[Bahá'í administration]]'s control over members of the [[Baha'i faith]] to panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=Juan |date=June 1998 |title=The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal=The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=234–238| access-date=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panopticon has also become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft, documented in a 2009 paper by Max Haiven and Scott Stoneman entitled ''[[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]: The Panopticon of Time''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = PDF | url = http://www.opencircle.mcmaster.ca/institute-on-globalization-and-the-human-condition/documents/IGHC-WPS_09-1_HaivenStoneman.pdf | last1 = Haiven | first1 = Max | last2 = Stoneman | first2 = Scott | year = 2009 |title=Wal-Mart: The Panopticon of Time |pages=3–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2014 book by Simon Head, ''Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Head |chapter=Walmart and Amazon |editor-first=Tim |editor-last=Bartlett |title=Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Makes Dumber Humans |publisher=Basic Books |place=New York, NY |year=2014 |isbn= 0-46501844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes conditions at an [[Amazon.com]] depot in [[Augsburg]], Germany. Both argue that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and [[production quota|quotas]] in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management.

Social theorist [[Simone Browne (sociologist)|Simone Browne]] reviews Bentham's theories in her book ''Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simone |last=Browne |authorlink=Simone Browne (sociologist) |title=Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham NC|year=2015 |isbn=9780822359197 |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters }}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that Bentham travelled on a ship carrying a cargo of what he calls "18 young Negresses" while drafting his Panopticon proposal, and argues that the structure of chattel slavery haunts the theory of the Panopticon. She proposes that the plan of the slave ship ''[[Brookes (ship)|Brookes]]'', produced and distributed by the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] in 1789, should be regarded as the paradigmatic blueprint for what she calls "racializing surveillance".

== The Panopticon of Social Media ==

The concept of Panopticon has been referenced in discussions about of the impact of social media. Jake Goldenfein, researcher at the University of Melbourne's Centre for Media and Communications Law explains that, "The relevance of the panopticon as a metaphor begins to wither when we start thinking about whether contemporary types of visuality (effectively digital and data-driven) are analogous to the central tower concept. For example, whether this type of visuality is as asymmetrical, and – I think more importantly – being co-opted for the same political exercise. Does the fact that we don’t know we’re being watched mean we are being normalized in the way the panopticon was intended to correct behaviour?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Thomas|title=What does the panopticon mean in the age of digital surveillance?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1888DemocraticPoster 2.png|thumb|''Public office is a public trust'']]
The concept of the '''public trust''' relates back to the origins of [[democratic government]] and its seminal idea that within the public lies the true power and future of a society; therefore, whatever ''trust'' the public places in its officials must be respected.
One of the reasons that [[bribery]] is regarded as a notorious [[evil]] is that it contributes to a culture of [[political corruption]] in which the public trust is eroded. Other issues related to political corruption or betrayal of public trust are [[lobbying]], special [[interest group]]s and the public [[cartel]].

==Use in the Philippines==
{{See also|Impeachment in the Philippines}}
In the Philippines, "betrayal of public trust" is one of the impeachable offenses. In ''Francisco, Jr. vs. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc.,'' the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] ruled that the definition of "betrayal of public trust" is "a non-justiciable political question which is beyond the scope of its judicial power" under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Francisco, Jr. v. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc. |vol=415 |reporter= SCRA |opinion=44 |pinpoint=105 |court=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] |date=2003 |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/nov2003/160261.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not prescribe which branch of government has the power to define it, but implies that Congress, which handles impeachment cases, has the power to do so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">A '''puppet ruler''' is a person who has a title indicating possession of [[political power]], but who, in reality, is controlled by outside individuals or forces.  Such outside power can be exercised by a foreign government, in which case the puppet ruler's domain is called a [[puppet state]].  But the puppet ruler may also be controlled by internal forces, such as non-elected officials.

== Examples ==
=== In Latin America ===
Governing through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in [[Latin America]]. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian façade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]], [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Núñez]] of [[Colombia]], [[Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez]] of [[Costa Rica]], [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], [[Ulises Heureaux]] and [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Gabriel García Moreno]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Raoul Cédras]] of [[Haiti]], [[Porfirio Díaz]] and [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] of [[Mexico]], the [[Somoza family]] of [[Nicaragua]], [[José Antonio Remón Cantera]], [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]], [[Dési Bouterse]] of [[Suriname]], and [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] and [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] of [[Venezuela]]. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the "puppets" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.
=== Elsewhere ===

A puppet does not have to be a national ruler.  For example, [[Oscar K. Allen]] was widely recognized to be [[Huey Long]]'s puppet while serving as governor of [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5107&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Interwar period|the years before]] and during [[World War II]], [[Puyi]], the deposed [[Emperor of China]], is usually considered to have been the [[Emperor of Manchukuo|puppet ruler of]] [[Manchukuo]], a [[client state]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] on the Chinese mainland. &lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Win Myint (politician)|Win Myint]], the current [[President of Myanmar|president]] of [[Myanmar]], is widely viewed by political commentators as a puppet president for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who is constitutionally barred from holding the office of president.

'''Rav akçesi''' was a "[[rabbi]] tax" paid by [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish communities]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turcica: revue d'études turques, Volumes 24-25|year=1992|publisher=Éditions Klincksieck|pages=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3lpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;dq=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ENqtTc77LZCp8APbtrSVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of Rav akçesi are unclear; it has been suggested that it was one of two taxes imposed specifically on Jews, and that it may have developed in parallel with the authority of a senior rabbi in [[Istanbul]], who was at nominally a representative and judge for Jewish communities in the Ottoman empire, although their authority may not have extended far beyond Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The privileges granted by Mehmed II to his Physician|journal=Bulletin of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]|year=1952|volume=14|pages=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rohschürmann|first=Michael|title="Die Tore der Freiheit"- Die Dhimma-Politik am Beispiel des jüdischen Milets im Osmanischen Reich und deren Auswirkungen auf die heutigen türkischen Juden|year=2009|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-28937-0|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that [[Mehmet II]] imposed the tax in return for separate representation of Jews after 1455, as part of a broader effort to rebuild and revive Istanbul; this may also have served to undermine the Greek patriarchy. Under the Ottoman empire there was, at time, friction between "Greeks" and "Jews"; the authorities may at times have favoured one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ankori, Zvi (1977). Greek Orthodox Theological Review. 22 (1): 17–57. "Greek Orthodox-Jewish Relations in Historic Perspective: The Jewish View." &lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''rav akçesi'' was a cash tax, rather than a tax in kind, it could be [[hypothecation|hypothecated]] to provide specific goods; tax records for 1655 show that the rav akçesi in [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] (Bitola) was a significant source of funding of drapery for [[Janissary|janissaries]]; the tax official responsible for purchases would be the same person responsible for collecting the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|issue=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims were usually taxed at a higher rate, overall, in the Ottoman empire, thanks to taxes such as rav akçesi and [[ispence]]. Jews in particular may have been singled out to pay higher rates of ispence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was well aware of this - and even aware that this would tempt nonmuslims to convert; [[Bayezit II]] ruled that courts should treat nonmuslims more leniently (including such measures as lower fines), "''so that the poll-tax payers shall not vanish''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman empire|taxes in the Ottoman empire]], rav akçesi could be affected by a complex patchwork of local rules and exemptions, including [[muafiyet]]; the Jews of Selanik ([[Thessaloniki]]) were among those exempted from taxes by a muafname after the city was conquered by [[Murad II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zachariadou|first=Elisavet|authorlink=Elizabeth Zachariadou|title=The Via Egnatia under Ottoman rule (1380-1699)|year=1992|publisher=Crete University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Socialism sidebar |Variants}}

'''Reformism''' is a political doctrine advocating the [[reform]] of an existing system or institution instead of its abolition and replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/reformism | title=Reformism | author=Collins English Dictionary | year= | website= | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers | accessdate=8 August 2017 | quote= a doctrine or movement advocating reform, esp political or religious reform, rather than abolition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[socialist]] movement, reformism is the view that gradual changes through existing institutions can eventually lead to fundamental changes in a society’s [[Political system|political]] and [[economic system]]s. Reformism as a political tendency and hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that revolutionary upheaval is a necessary precondition for the structural changes necessary to transform a [[capitalist]] system to a qualitatively different socialist economic system.

As a doctrine, reformism is distinguished from the act of pragmatic reform: pragmatic reform aims to safeguard and permeate the status quo by preventing fundamental structural changes to it, whereas reformism posits that an accumulation of reforms can eventually lead to the emergence of entirely different economic and political systems than those of present-day capitalism and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today and Jesus followers | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | website= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are two types of reformism. One has no intention of bringing about socialism or fundamental economic change to society and is used to oppose such structural changes. The other is based on the assumption that while reforms are not socialist in themselves, they can help rally supporters to the cause of revolution by popularizing the cause of socialism to the working class.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate on the ability for [[social democratic]] reformism to lead to a socialist transformation of society is over a century old.

Reformism is criticized for being paradoxical: it seeks to overcome the existing economic system of capitalism, but it tries to improve the conditions of capitalism thereby making it appear more tolerable to society. According to [[Rosa Luxemburg]], under reformism, "(capitalism) is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm | title=Do We Support Reformist Demands? | author=Duncan Hallas | year=1973 | website=Controversy: Do we support reformist demands? | publisher=International Socialism | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Stan Parker of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] argues that reforms are a diversion of energy for socialists and are limited because they must adhere to the logic of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French social theorist [[Andre Gorz]] criticized reformism by advocating a third alternative to reformism and social revolution that he called "non-reformist reforms", specifically focused on structural changes to capitalism, as opposed to reforms for improve living conditions within capitalism or to prop it up through economic interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/363/do-we-need-reform-or-revolution |title=Do we need reform of revolution?|author=Lois Clifton |date=November 2011 |publisher=Socialist Review |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1875 [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) adopted a [[Gotha Program]] that proposed "every lawful means" on a way to a "socialist society" and was criticized by [[Karl Marx]] who considered the [[communist revolution]] a required step. One of the delegates to the SPD congress,  [[Eduard Bernstein]], expanded on the concept, proposing ''evolutionary socialism''. Bernstein was a leading [[social democracy|social democrat]] in Germany. Reformism was quickly targeted by [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]], with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemning Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Reform or Revolution?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm Rosa Luxemburg. ''Reform or Revolution'' (1900)]&lt;/ref&gt; While Luxemburg died in the [[German Revolution]], the reformists soon found themselves contending with the [[Bolsheviks]] and their satellite [[Communism|communist]] parties for the support of intellectuals and the [[working class]].

In 1959, the [[Godesberg Program]] (signed at a party convention in the West German capital of [[Bad Godesberg]]) marked the shift of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) from a Marxist program espousing an end to capitalism to a reformist one focused on social reform.

After [[Joseph Stalin]] consolidated power in the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Comintern]] launched a campaign against the Reformist movement by denouncing them as "[[Social fascism|social fascists]]".  According to ''[[The God that Failed]]'' by [[Arthur Koestler]], a former member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], the largest communist party in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Interwar period]], communists, aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], continued to consider the "social fascist" Social Democratic Party of Germany to be the real enemy in [[Germany]], even after the [[Nazi Party]] had gotten into power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler|Koestler, Arthur]]. ''[[The God That Failed]].'' Edited by [[Richard Crossman]]. Bantam Matrix, Tenth Edition. pp 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, reformists are seen as [[centre-left]]. Some social democratic parties, such as the Canadian [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, are still considered to be reformist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/dowson/ndp.html#3|title=The Socialist Vanguard and the New Democratic Party|last=Dowson|first=Ross|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformism in the British Labour Party==
The term was applied to elements within the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the 1950s and subsequently, on the party's right. [[Anthony Crosland]] wrote ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956) as a personal manifesto arguing for a reformulation of the term. For Crosland, the relevance of [[nationalization]] (or [[public ownership]]) for socialists was much reduced as a consequence of contemporary [[full employment]], [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] management of the economy and reduced [[capitalism|capitalist]] exploitation. In 1960, after the third successive defeat of his party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 General Election]] [[Hugh Gaitskell]] attempted to reformulate the original wording of [[Clause IV]] in the party's constitution, but proved unsuccessful.

Some of the younger followers of Gaitskell, principally [[Roy Jenkins]], [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] left the Labour Party in 1981 to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], but the central objective of the [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellites]] was eventually achieved by [[Tony Blair]] in his successful attempt to rewrite Clause IV in 1995.

The use of the term is distinguished from the [[gradualism]] associated with [[Fabianism]] (the ideology of the [[Fabian Society]]), which itself should not be seen as being in parallel with the revisionism associated with Bernstein and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, as originally the Fabians had explicitly rejected [[Marxism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1800">The '''Rivers and Harbors Bill''' was a bill passed by Congress in 1846 to provide $500,000 to improve rivers and harbors. When the Senate passed the Rivers and Harbors Bill 34 to 16 on July 24, 1846, opponents lobbied for a presidential veto.&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Borneman, ''Polk: The Man Who Transformed the Presidency and America'' (2009) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; It was vetoed by President [[James K. Polk]] on August 3. The bill would have provided for federally funded internal improvements on small harbors, many of them on the [[Great Lakes]]. Polk believed that this was unconstitutional because the bill unfairly favored particular areas, including that which had no foreign trade.

Polk believed that these problems were local and not national. Polk feared that passing the Rivers and Harbors Bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home districts, a type of [[political corruption]] that would spell doom to the [[Republicanism in the United States|virtue of the republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Yonatan Eyal, ''The Young America movement and the transformation of the Democratic Party'' (2007) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard he followed his hero, [[Andrew Jackson]], who authored the [[Maysville Road veto]] in 1830 on similar grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Eaton Byrnes, ''James K. Polk: a biographical companion'' (2001) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Clay]] and his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], by contrast, supported the bill because they believed the national government had a responsibility to promote trade commerce and economic modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), 232–37&lt;/ref&gt;

It uses confirmation codes to allow a voter to prove to themselves that their ballot is included unmodified in the final tally. The codes are privacy-preserving and offer no proof of which candidate a voter voted for. Receipts can be safely shown without compromising ballot secrecy.&lt;ref name="scantegrity"&gt;{{Citation

''Scantegrity II'' prints the confirmation codes in [[invisible ink]] to improve usability and dispute resolution. As the system relies on cryptographic techniques, the ability to validate an election outcome is both [[Software independence|software independent]] as well as independent of faults in the physical [[Chain of custody|chain-of-custody]] of the paper ballots. The system was developed by a team of researchers including cryptographers [[David Chaum]] and [[Ron Rivest]].

== Advantages ==

[[Optical scan voting system]]s produce an electronic [[Tally (voting)|tally]], while maintaining the original paper ballots which can be rescanned or manually hand-counted to provide an ostensibly corroborative tally. However, the correctness of each of these tallies requires the voter to either trust that the software is error-free and has not been hacked, or that the physical chain-of-custody of the ballots has not been broken at any point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rowell |first=Laurie |title=Down for the Count |newspaper=ACM NetWorker Magazine |date=March 2008 |url=http://mags.acm.org/networker/200803/ |issue=12:1 |pages=17–23 |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205070217/http://mags.acm.org/networker/200803/ |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other E2E voting systems such as [[Punchscan]] and [[ThreeBallot]], address these issues but require existing polling place equipment and procedures to be greatly altered or replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Scantegrity is an [[Retrofit|add-on]] meant to be used in conjunction with existing optical scan equipment, thereby requiring fewer hardware and software and procedural modifications.&lt;ref name="scantegrity" /&gt;
 
For all other voters, the ballot marking procedure is essentially identical to conventional optical scan paper-ballots. Similarly, the underlying system still produces both an electronic tally as well as a human readable [[wiktionary:paper trail|paper trail]] through which [[Vote counting system#Manual counting|manual recounts]] can still be conducted.

Voters wishing to verify that their vote is unmodified may write down the confirmation codes for each race on a detachable chit that contains the ballot's serial number.&lt;ref name="technologyreview"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the voter can simply ignore the code and continue to mark and cast their ballot as normal.

The confirmation codes are randomly assigned to the ballots, allowing voters to freely share their codes while keeping their votes secret. The codes are also [[Commitment scheme|pre-committed]] to a committee of mutually-distrustful entities (such as representatives of each political party) so that the confirmation codes cannot be changed or misprinted without detection. Voters may request additional ballots to audit—they ensure the ballots are properly printed by revealing all the codes and comparing these to the codes committed to.

=== Checking ===

After the election is finished, the election authority publicly posts a list of confirmation codes for the positions marked on each ballot it received. Voters who wrote down their codes can verify that the codes are correct for their ballot number and that no codes were added or removed.&lt;ref name="technologyreview" /&gt; If the posted record is incorrect, the voter may file a dispute. Spurious disputes can be excluded from consideration by comparing the claimed codes to the set of possible codes for a given contest on a ballot—the probability of randomly guessing a code that actually appeared on the ballot is low.

=== Verification ===

After the election, the trustees generate an independent tally from the voter-verifiable list of ballots and confirmation codes. Since the link between a confirmation code and the candidate voted for must remain secret, the tally is generated using an anonymity-preserving backend. Many such backends have been proposed for tallying votes, including the ones used by [[Punchscan]] and [[Prêt à Voter]]. Steps in the tally can be recalculated by anyone to ensure its correctness. For this reason, the system is more accurately described as mathematical voting than electronic voting. The security of the system does not require any software to operate correctly, only that the mathematical operations are independently corroborated by all interested parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''''Schutzjude''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃʊtsˌjuːdə|lang}}, "protected Jew") was a status for [[History of the Jews in Germany| German Jew]]s granted by the imperial, princely or royal courts. 

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], except some eastern territories gained by the Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries (e.g. [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]), Jews usually had the status of [[Servi camerae regis]]. This status included imperial protection and the levying of special taxes on the Jews for the Empire's treasury (Latin: camera regis). But the emperors, always short of money, alienated — by sale or pledge — their privilege to levy extra taxes on Jews, not all at once, but territory by territory to different creditors and purchasers. Thus Jews lost their — not always reliable — imperial protection. 

Many territories that gained supremacy over the Jews living within their boundaries subsequently expelled them. After the general expulsions of the Jews from a given territory often only single Jews&amp;nbsp;— if any at all&amp;nbsp;— would be granted the personal privilege to reside within the territory. This personal privilege, documented by a ''Schutzbrief'' (writ of protection), a ''Geleitsbrief'' (writ of escort), or (in Brandenburg) a ''Patent'', was sometimes inheritable by only one son (in rare instances, by all sons), and was sometimes uninheritable. Jews holding such a privilege were thus called ''Schutzjuden'', ''vergeleitete Juden'', or ''Patentjuden'', as opposed to Jews who had no right of residence, who were known as ''unvergeleitete Juden''. The latter were not allowed to marry, and might spend their life unmarried as a member of the household of a privileged relative or employer. 

For example, in October 1763 King [[Frederick II "the Great", King in Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] granted [[Moses Mendelssohn]], until then under protection by being employed by a ''Patentjude'', a personal, uninheritable privilege, which assured his right to undisturbed residence in [[Berlin]]. His wife and children, who had no independent permission to reside, lost their status of family member of a ''Patentjude'' when Mendelssohn died in 1786. They were later granted multi-son inheritable ''Patents''. In 1810 [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein's]] [[Prussian reforms]] introduced a freely inheritable Prussian citizenship for all subjects of the king, doing away with the different prior legal status of the Estates, such as the Nobility, the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of the chartered cities, the unfree peasants, the officialdom at the court, the Patent Jews, and the [[Huguenot]]s.

[[File:Malay Regiment operatives 1949.JPG|thumb|Members of the [[Royal Malay Regiment]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] in 1949, inspecting equipment captured in a raid.]]
A  '''state of emergency''' (also known as a '''state of calamity''' in the [[Philippines]]) is a situation in which a government is empowered to perform actions that it would normally not be permitted. A government can declare such state during a disaster, civil unrest, or [[armed conflict]]. Such declaration alerts citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. ''[[Justitium]]'' is its equivalent in Roman law&amp;mdash;a concept in which the senate could put forward a final decree ([[senatus consultum ultimum]]) that was not subject to dispute.

States of emergency can also be used as a rationale or pretext for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's [[constitution]] or [[basic law]]. The procedure for and legality of doing so vary by country.

==Relationship with international law==

Under [[international law]], rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency; for example, a government can detain persons and hold them without trial. All rights that can be derogated from are listed in the [[ICCPR|International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights]]. Non-derogable rights cannot be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} D. Prémont, C. Stenersen, I. Oseredczuk, Bruylant, Brussels, ''Droits intangibles et états d'exception''[fr.] 1996, 644p., {{ISBN|2-8027-0766-3}}, Éditions ''Bruylant''&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-derogable rights are listed in Article 4 of the ICCPR, they include [[right to life]], the rights to freedom from [[arbitrary detention|arbitrary deprivation of liberty]], freedom of [[slavery]] and to freedom from [[torture]] and/or [[cruel and unusual punishment|ill-treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 4, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries have made it illegal to modify emergency law or the constitution during the emergency; other countries have the freedom to change any legislation or rights based constitutional frameworks at any time that the legislative chooses to do so. Constitutions are contracts between the government and the private individuals of that country. The International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is an international law document signed by states.  Therefore, the Covenant applies to only those persons acting in an [[official capacity]], not private individuals. However, signatories to the Covenant are expected to integrate it into national legislation. The state of emergency (within the ICCPR framework) must be publicly declared and the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] must be contacted immediately, to declare the reason for the emergency, the date on which the emergency is to start, the derogations that may take place, with the timeframe of the emergency and the date in which the emergency is expected to finish. Although this is common protocol stipulated by the ICCPR, this is often not strictly followed; enforcement is better regulated by European Convention of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/12431137/stato_di_eccezione_ed_ordinamento_democratico {{lang|it|Declaratoria dello stato di emergenza e Consiglio supremo di difesa}} Nuovi studi politici, gennaio-giugno 2005, n. 1/2, p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and viewpoints==&lt;!--Linked from 'Giorgio Agamben'--&gt;
Though fairly uncommon in democracies, [[dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights.&lt;ref&gt;See Judson, 2012, "[http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/handle/10523/2279. Where is R2P grounded in international law]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}".&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, [[martial law]] is also declared, allowing the [[military]] greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. [[Nicole Questiaux]] (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]], have recommended to the international community to adopt the following "principles" to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. "Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also ''[[:fr:état d'exception|état d'exception]]'').

Article 4 to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), permits states to [[Derogation|derogate]] from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in "time of public emergency". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[European Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Convention on Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 27&lt;/ref&gt; have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the [[ILO Conventions|International Labour Conventions]].

Some [[political theory|political theorists]], such as [[Carl Schmitt]], have argued that the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines [[sovereignty]] itself. In [[State of Exception (2005)|''State of Exception'' (2005)]], [[Giorgio Agamben]] criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their [[civil and political rights]], producing his interpretation of ''[[homo sacer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agamben|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse===
Sometimes, the state of emergency can be [[abuse]]d by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 attempted coup]] in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

Derogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

==Law in selected countries==

===Argentina===
The Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally ''estado de sitio'', ''state of siege''), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition ({{As of|2010|lc=on}}  state of emergencies had been declared 52 times by democratic and dictatorial governments, starting in 1854 shortly after the constitution came into force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derecho.laguia2000.com/derecho-politico/estado-de-sitio |title=State of emergency in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries (in Spanish) |publisher=Derecho.laguia2000.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Pacto de San José de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the [[National Reorganization Process]], restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected.

===Australia===
State-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia.

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the premier can declare a state of emergency if there is a threat to employment, safety or public order.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier. Under the Public Safety Preservation Act, a declared state of emergency allows the premier to immediately make any desired regulations to secure public order and safety. However, these regulations expire if Parliament does not agree to continue them within 7 days. Also, under the Essential Services Act, the premier (or delegate) may operate or prohibit operation of, as desired, any essential service (e.g., transport, fuel, power, water, gas).

In regards to Emergency Management, regions (usually on a [[local government area]] basis) that have been affected by a [[natural disaster]] are the responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency where access to the Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond to and recover from natural disasters. A State of Emergency does not apply to the whole state, but rather [[districts]] or [[shire]]s, where essential services may have been disrupted.

See also, [[Exceptional circumstances]]; a term most commonly used in Australia with regard to emergency relief payments.

===Brazil===
Extreme act that, in Brazil (''Estado de Sítio'' or ''Estado de Exceção'', in Portuguese), can be declared on the following circumstances:
*Serious disturbance with national impact;
*Inefficiency on the Defense State previously decreed;
*[[Declaration of war]];
*Response to foreign armed aggression.

The state of emergency could last for 30 days, being possible to extend it for more days in case of persistence of the reasons of exceptionality.

Only the [[President of Brazil|President]] is able to declare or prorogate this State; after receiving formal authorization from [[Congresso Nacional|National Congress]] and after consultation with the National Security Council or the Council of the Republic.

===Canada===
The [[Politics of Canada|federal government of Canada]] can use the [[Emergencies Act]] to invoke a state of emergency. A national state of emergency automatically expires after 90 days, unless extended by the Governor-in-Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/E-4.5/bo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35//en#anchorbo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35 |title=Emergencies Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105195914/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/E-4.5/bo-ga%3Al_III-gb%3As_35//en#anchorbo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35 |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different levels of emergencies: Public Welfare Emergency, Public Order Emergency, International Emergency, and War Emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/E-4.5///en |title=Emergencies Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105200003/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/E-4.5///en |archivedate=January 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emergencies Act replaced the [[War Measures Act]] in 1988. The War Measures Act was invoked three times in Canadian history, most controversially during the 1970 [[October Crisis]], and also during [[World War I]] (from 1914 to 1920, against threat of Communism) and [[World War II]] (from 1942 to 1945, against perceived threat from Japanese Canadians following [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan's]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]).

Under the current Emergency Act a state of emergency can also be declared by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/stateofemergency/ |title=State of Emergency FAQ |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2003-08-07 |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511111456/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/stateofemergency/ |archivedate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition Canada's federal government and any of its provincial governments can suspend, for five years at a time, [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] rights to fundamental freedoms in section 2, to legal rights in sections 7 through 14, and to equality rights in section 15 by legislation which invokes the notwithstanding clause, section 33, and therefore emergency powers can effectively be created even without using the Emergency Act.

===Denmark===
The police chief in a district can impose a zone in which people can be [[strip search|body searched]] without a specific suspicion. Such an order must be issued in writing, published, and imposed for a limited period. The police law (article 6) regulates this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=1836#K3 |title=The Danish police law&amp;nbsp;— law number 444 of June 9, 2004 |publisher=Retsinformation.dk |date=2004-09-21 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal procedure calls for assisting the suspect to a private area and stripping them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/indland/article472795.ece Politi: De unge klager over racistiske betjente] (The police: Youth complain over racist cops), by Andreas Lindqvist, Politiken, February 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

If the police feel that a situation involving a crowd of people can get out of hand, they can order the assembly to be dissolved and "pass the street" in the name of the king. People that after three such warnings are still part of the crowd can then without further warning be subjugated to [[mass arrest]]. All people arrested can then be detained for 24 hours without charging them or taking them for a judge. This is called a [[preventive detention|precluding arrest]].

The emergency was imposed during the [[Six-Day War|1967 Arab-Israeli War]], and reimposed following the [[assassination]] of President [[Anwar Sadat]]. The law continuously extended every three years since 1981. Under the law, police powers were extended, constitutional rights suspended and [[censorship]] was legalized.&lt;ref name=Shehata&gt;{{cite web|last=Shehata|first=Samer|title=Egypt After 9/11: Perceptions of the United States|url=http://conconflicts.ssrc.org/archives/mideast/shehata/|work=Contemporary Conflicts|publisher=Social Science Research Council|accessdate=29 January 2011|date=March 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law sharply circumscribed any non-governmental political activity: [[Demonstration (people)|street demonstrations]], non-approved political organizations, and unregistered financial donations were formally banned.

===France===
[[File:Police nationale en service en réponse aus Attentats à Paris, November 15, 2015.jpg|thumb|State of emergency in [[Paris]], November 2015]]
{{Main article|States of emergency in France}}
Three main provisions concern various kind of "state of emergency" in France: Article 16 of the [[Constitution of France|Constitution of 1958]] allows, in time of crisis, "extraordinary powers" to the president. Article 36 of the same constitution regulates "state of siege" (''[[:fr:État de siège (France)|état de siège]]''). Finally, the Act of 3 April 1955 allows the proclamation, by the Council of Ministers, of the "state of emergency" (''[[:fr:État d'urgence en France|état d'urgence]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000695350 |title=Loi n°55-385 du 3 avril 1955 instituant un état d'urgence et en déclarant l'application en Algérie |language= fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between article 16 and the 1955 Act concerns mainly the distribution of powers: whereas in article 16, the executive power basically suspend the regular procedures of the Republic, the 1955 Act permits a twelve-day state of emergency, after which a new law extending the emergency must be voted by the Parliament. These dispositions have been used at various times, in 1955, 1958, 1961, 1988, 2005, and 2015.

===Germany===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Eschede train disaster]] --&gt;
The [[Weimar Republic]] constitution (1919–1933)&lt;ref&gt;Weimar constitution technically remained in effect throughout the Nazi era (1933–1945).&lt;/ref&gt; allowed states of emergency under [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] to deal with rebellions. Article 48 was often invoked during the 14-year life of the Republic, sometimes for no reason other than to allow the government to act when it was unable to obtain a [[parliament]]ary majority.

After the February 27, 1933, [[Reichstag fire]], an attack blamed on the [[communism|communists]], [[Adolf Hitler]] declared a state of emergency using Article 48, and then had President [[Paul von Hindenburg|von Hindenburg]] sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which suspended the [[Weimar Constitution]] for the whole duration of the [[Third Reich]]: the Weimar Constitution was never actually repealed by [[Nazi Germany]], but "indefinitely suspended". After the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] on March 1, 1933,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} the [[Nazi Party]] was free to vote in the March 23, [[Enabling Act of 1933|1933 Enabling Act]], which enabled Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the Reichstag. These two laws implemented the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', the Nazis' institution of [[totalitarianism]].

In the postwar [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] the ''[[German Emergency Acts|Emergency Acts]]'' state that some of the basic constitutional rights of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] may be limited in case of a [[State of Defence (Germany)|state of defence]], a state of tension, or an internal state of emergency or disaster (catastrophe). These amendments to the constitution were passed on May 30, 1968, despite fierce opposition by the so-called ''extra-parliamentary opposition'' (see [[German student movement#Emergency Acts|German student movement]] for details).

===Hong Kong===
The [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] can declare a state of emergency and deploy troops from the [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] under the Law of the People's Republic of China on the garrisoning of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] along with the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] can prohibit public gatherings, issue [[curfew]] orders, prohibit the movement of vessels or aircraft and appoint special constable all under Chapter 245 ("Public Order Ordinance") of [[Hong Kong Law]].

Since 1997, no emergency measures have been enacted. Prior to that date, emergency measures were used for four major incidents:
* [[Hong Kong 1956 riots]] – with involvement of [[British Armed Forces]] and Hong Kong Police
* [[Hong Kong 1966 riots]] – with involvement of British Forces and Hong Kong Police
* [[Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots]] – with involvement of British Forces and Hong Kong Police
* [[Hong Kong 1981 riots]] – with involvement of Hong Kong Police

===Hungary===
According to the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Constitution, the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] can declare state of emergency in case of armed rebellion or natural or industrial disaster. It expires after 30 days, but can be extended. Most civil rights can be suspended, but basic human rights (such as the right to life, the ban of torture, and freedom of religion) cannot.

During state of emergency, the Parliament cannot be disbanded.

===Iceland===
The [[Constitution of Iceland|Icelandic constitution]] provides no mechanism for state of emergency nor martial law.

===India===
{{Main article|State of Emergency in India}}

In India, an external state of emergency was declared two times during wars:
* In 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]]
* In 1971 [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]

In 1975, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] declared a [[The Emergency (India)|state of internal emergency]] after she was indicted in a corruption scandal and ordered to vacate her seat in the [[Indian Parliament]], allowing herself to rule by [[decree]] until 1977. It all started after [[Raj Narain]], who had been defeated in parliamentary election by Indira Gandhi, lodged cases of election fraud and use of state machinery for election purposes against Gandhi in the [[Allahabad High Court]]. While some serious charges such as bribing voters and election malpractices were dropped, on 12 June 1975, Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the [[Allahabad High Court]] found the Prime Minister guilty on the charge of misuse of government machinery for her election campaign, such as using the state police to build a dais, availing the services of a government officer, Yashpal Kapoor (IAS), during the elections before he had resigned from his position, and use of electricity from the state electricity department. The court declared her election null and void and unseated her from her seat in the Lok Sabha. The court also banned her from contesting any election for an additional six years.

Protests led by J.P.Narayan, Raj Narain, Satyendra Narayan Sinha and Morarji Desai flooded the streets of Delhi close to the Parliament building and the Prime Minister's residence, and in response, Mrs Gandhi declared a state of emergency, suspending civil liberties. Political opposition was heavily suppressed during the emergency. The Government used police forces across the country to arrest thousands of protestors and strike leaders. J.P. Narayan, Raj Narain, Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, Jivatram Kripalani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Satyendra Narayan Sinha and other protest leaders were immediately arrested. Organizations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, along with some opposition political parties were banned. Nearly two years later, confident about her chances of getting re-elected, [[Indira Gandhi]] relaxed the emergency, released dissidents and announced elections.

In the ensuing election, [[Raj Narain]] and his colleagues rode a popular wave of unrest to defeat her and her Government. [[Raj Narain]] won decisively in the Prime Minister's home constituency of Rae Bareli, and for the first time a non-[[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government took office in [[Republic of India]].

===Ireland===
In Ireland declaring a state of "national emergency" involves Article 28.3.3° of the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]], which states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article28_3_3|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 28.3.3° |nopp=Y|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Nothing in this Constitution [.&lt;!--explained below under 21st Amendment--&gt;..] shall be invoked to invalidate any law [[Enactment of a bill|enacted]] by the [[Oireachtas]] [parliament] which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion, or to nullify any act done or purporting to be done in time of war or armed rebellion in pursuance of any such law.}}

In addition, during a "war or armed rebellion", [[military tribunal]]s may try civilians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article38_4_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 38.4.1° |nopp=Y|accessdate=2 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] are not bound by [[habeas corpus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article40_4_5|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 40.4.5° |nopp=Y|accessdate=2 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[First Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|First Amendment of the Constitution]] of 1939 allows an emergency to be declared during wars in which the state is a [[non-belligerent]], subject to [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s by the houses of the Oireachtas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/ca/1/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=First Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1939., Section 1|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|2nd Amendment]] of 1941, an emergency ends, not automatically when the war does, but only by Oireachtas resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1941/ca/2/schedule/enacted/en/html#sched|title=Second Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1941., Schedule|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Ref No.22 |nopp=Y|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|21st Amendment]] of 2002 prevents the [[Capital punishment in Ireland|reintroduction of capital punishment]] during an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/ca/21/schedule/enacted/en/html#sched-partii|title=Twenty-First Amendment of the Constitution Act, 2001, Schedule, Part ii|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017|quote=In Article 28.3.3°, to insert "other than Article 15.5.2°" after "Constitution";}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first amendment was rushed through the Oireachtas after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], in which [[Irish neutrality during World War II|the state remained neutral]]. Immediately after, the required resolution was passed, in turn enabling the passage of the [[Emergency Powers Act 1939]] (EPA), which granted the [[government of Ireland|government]] and its ministers sweeping powers to issue [[statutory order]]s termed "Emergency Powers Orders" (EPOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1939090200001|title=Proceedings of 2 September 1939|work=Dáil Éireann debates|pages=Vol.77 cc.1–190|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/act/28/enacted/en/html|title=Emergency Powers Act, 1939|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The period in Ireland was and is referred to as "[[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]".)

The 1939 state of emergency was not formally ended until a 1976 resolution, which also declared a new state of emergency in relation to [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] and in particular the recent assassination of the British ambassador to Ireland, [[Christopher Ewart Biggs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1976083100004|title=National Emergency: Motion|date=31 August 1976|work=Dáil debates|accessdate=31 March 2017}}; {{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1976090100004|title=National Emergency: Motion (Resumed).|date=1 September 1976|work=Dáil debates|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emergency Powers Act 1976 was then passed to increase the [[Garda Síochána]] powers to arrest, detain, and question those suspected of [[Offences against the State Acts 1939–1998|offences against the state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1976/act/33/section/2/enacted/en/html#sec2|title=Emergency Powers Act, 1976, Section 2|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh]] referred the bill under [[Article 26 of the Constitution of Ireland|Article 26 of the Constitution]] to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], which upheld its constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/%28WebFiles%29/8AE4D75D995AA3FA802575F3002D5D4F/$FILE/Emergency%20Powers_%5B1977%5D%20IR%20159.htm In re Article 26 and the Emergency Powers Bill 1976] Supreme Court&lt;/ref&gt; The referral was condemned by minister [[Paddy Donegan]] as a "thundering disgrace", causing Ó Dálaigh to resign in protest.

===Israel and Palestine===
Israel's [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations|Emergency Defence Regulations]] are older than the state itself, having been passed under the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]] in 1945. A repeal was briefly considered in 1967 but cancelled following the [[Six-Day War]]. The regulations allow Israel, through [[Israeli Defense Forces|its military]], to control movements and prosecute suspected terrorists in [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]], and to censor publications that are deemed prejudicial to national defense.

===Macau===
The [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] can declare a state of emergency and deploy troops from the [[People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison]] under the Article 14 of Macau's Basic Law on the defence of the Macau Special Administrative Region.

The [[Chief Executive of Macau]] can use the [[Macau national security law]] to prohibit public gatherings, issue [[curfew]] orders, prohibit other activities perceived to be a threat against the Region or China.

Since 1999 no emergency measure have been enacted. Prior to 1999 emergency measures have been used for 1 major incident:
* [[12-3 incident]] (1966) – with [[martial law]] invoked and involvement of [[Portuguese Army|Portuguese troops]]

===Malaysia===
{{Main article|Malayan Emergency}}
In [[Malaysia]], if the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (Monarch) is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security, or the economic life, or public order in the Federation or any part thereof is threatened, he may issue a Proclamation of Emergency making therein a declaration to that effect.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 1(A), Article 150, Constitution of Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of Malaysia, a state of emergency was declared by the then-colonial government of Britain. The state of emergency lasted from 1948 until 1960 to deal with the [[Malayan Communist Party|communists]] led by [[Chin Peng]].

States of emergency were also declared during the ''[[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]]'' in 1962, the [[1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis]] and [[1977 Kelantan Emergency]].

When a [[May 13 incident|race riot]] broke out on May 13, 1969, a state of emergency was declared.

On August 11, 2005 a state of emergency was announced for the world's 13th largest [[port]], [[Port Klang]] and the [[district]] of [[Kuala Selangor]] after air pollution there reached dangerous levels (defined as a value greater than 500 on the [[Air Pollution Index]] or API).

Thiery Rommel, the European Commission's envoy to Malaysia, told Reuters by telephone on November 13, 2007 (the last day of his mission) that, "Today, this country still lives under (a state of) emergency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-30475820071113?pageNumber=1 | work=Reuters | title=Malaysia lives under state of emergency&amp;nbsp;— EU envoy | date=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not officially proclaimed as a state of emergency, the Emergency Ordinance and the Internal Security Act had allowed detention for years without trial.

On June 23, 2013 a state of emergency was declared by Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak for Muar and Ledang, Johor as smoke from land-clearing fires in Indonesia pushed air pollution index to above 750. This is the first time in years that air quality has dipped to hazardous level with conditions worsening in as dry weather persists and fires rage in Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/749914 | title=PM declares haze emergency in Muar and Ledang | publisher=theSundaily | date=2013-06-23 | accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maldives===
On February 5, 2018, a state of emergency was declared by Maldives's President Abdulla Yameen for 15 days and ordered security forces into the supreme court and arrested a former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and the Chief Justice of Honorable Supreme court of Maldives. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/maldives-chief-justice-abdulla-saeed-arrested-as-president-abdulla-yameen-declares-state-of-emergenc-1809050 | title=Maldives Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed Arrested As President Abdulla Yameen declares state of emergency| publisher=NDTV news | date=2018-02-06 | access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 gives the [[Government of New Zealand|government]] and local [[city council]] the power to issue a state of emergency, either over the entire country or within a specific region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0033/latest/DLM149789.html |title=Civil Defense Emergency Management Act 2002 |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may suspend ordinary work and essential services if need be. The state of emergency in New Zealand expires on the commencement of the seventh day after the date on which it was declared, unless it is extended. However, the minister of civil defence or local mayor may lift the state of emergency after an initial review of the region's status.
* On 23 February 2011 at 11.28&amp;nbsp;am Minister of Civil Defence [[John Carter (New Zealand politician)|John Carter]] declared the first National State Of Emergency (for a civil defence emergency) in New Zealand's history in response to the February 22, [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].&lt;ref name=emergency&gt;{{cite web|title=Death toll at 75, national emergency declared|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/death-toll-75-national-emergency-declared-4038747|publisher=''Television New Zealand''|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local state of emergency was declared following the September 4, [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]].
* A state of emergency was declared previously during the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|1951 waterfront dispute]].

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, a state of emergency is usually declared in times of great civil unrest. In recent years, it has specifically been implemented in reaction to terrorist attacks on Nigerians by the Islamic jihadist group [[Boko Haram]].

On 14 May 2013, [[Goodluck Jonathan]] declared a state of emergency for the entire northeastern states of [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Yobe]] and [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/14/us-nigeria-emergency-idUSBRE94D0ZH20130514 | work=Reuters | title=Nigeria declares emergency in areas hit by Islamists | date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more limited state of emergency had been declared on 31 December 2011 in parts of Yobe, Borno, [[Plateau State|Plateau]] and [[Niger State|Niger]] states. This earlier declaration included the temporary shutdown of the international borders in those regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16373531 | work=BBC News | title=Boko Haram attacks prompt Nigeria state of emergency | date=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{Further information|International reaction to the 2007 Pakistani state of emergency}}
In Pakistan, a state of emergency was declared five times in its history:
* In 1958 by President [[Iskander Mirza]]
* In 1969 by President General [[Yahya Khan]]
* In 1977 by President General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]
* In 1998 by President [[Muhammad Rafiq Tarar]]
* In [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency|2007]] by President General [[Pervez Musharraf]]

The first three were regarded as the imposition of direct martial law.

===Romania===
{{Disputed section|date=June 2015}}
In [[Romania]], there are two types of states of emergency, each designed for a different type of situation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* State of alert (''Stare de alertă'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]): Non-military, can be enforced by a prefect. [[Roadblock]]s are enforced. Any utilitarian vehicle or equipment can be temporarily used by the state, without any restriction. Evacuation is not mandatory, unless extreme circumstances apply. Only [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], [[Romanian Police|Police]] and firefighting personnel are required to intervene. This situation can be enforced in case of [[natural disasters]] or [[civil unrest]].
* State of emergency (''stare de urgentă'' in Romanian): Can only be enforced by the [[President of Romania]] with approval from [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]. The [[Military of Romania|military]] becomes the upper form of control in the country (under the rule of the president).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The civilian population is subject to strict regulations, imposed by the type of emergency.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} All private and public non-crucial activities are suspended.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Essential services]] might be disrupted. This situation can be enforced in case of extreme circumstances, such as a war.
* Special zone of public safety (''Zonă specială de siguranță publică'' in Romanian): Administrative, can be enforced by local police. This implies installation of road check-points and higher numbers in police and [[Romanian riot police|gendarmes/ riot police]] presence, patrolling the area. There is also a ban that restricts the right to travel for people in the area; any vehicle and individual transiting the zone are subject to screening.&lt;ref name=zona&gt;Silviu Molnar, [http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/chevron-shale-security-zone-pungesti-romania Security Zone in Pungesti Heavily Criticized by European Greens], ''Natural Gas Europe'', 19 December 2013, Retrieved 23-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}}[http://adevarul.ro/locale/vaslui/video-comuna-pungesti-declarata-zona-speciala-siguranta-publica-1_52a46389c7b855ff568bb1f6/index.html Comuna Pungești, declarată „zonă specială de siguranță publică], ''Adevărul'', 19 December 2013, Retrieved 23-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-known event in which the state of emergency has been enforced was because of [[1977 Vrancea earthquake]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The last instance in which the ''special zone of public safety'' was enforced was in December 8, 2013-ongoing, in [[Pungești, Vaslui]] following [[2012–13 Romanian protests against shale gas|civil unrest in Pungești]] from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]'s plans to begin exploring shale-gas in the village.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Petrescu, [http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/riot-police-special-security-zone-chevron-romania Chevron Moves Forward in Romania Following Establishment of Special Security Zone], ''Natural Gas Europe'', 14 December 2013, Retrieved 23-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to police officials, the special security zone will be maintained as long as there is conflict in the area that poses a threat to Chevron’s operations.&lt;ref name=zona /&gt; This special security zone has faced domestic and international criticism for alleged human-rights abuses.

===South Africa===
{{further information|State of Emergency Act, 1997}}
States of emergency in [[South Africa]] are governed by section 37 of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] and by the [[State of Emergency Act, 1997]]. The [[President of South Africa|President]] may declare a state of emergency only when "the life of the nation is threatened by war, invasion, general insurrection, disorder, natural disaster or other public emergency" and if the ordinary laws and government powers are not sufficient to restore peace and order. The declaration is made by [[proclamation]] in the ''[[Government Gazette of South Africa|Government Gazette]]'' and may only apply from the time of publication, not retroactively. It can only continue for 21 days unless the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] grants an extension, which may be for at most three months at a time. The [[High Courts of South Africa|High Courts]] have the power, subject to confirmation by the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], to determine the validity of the declaration of a state of emergency.&lt;ref name="sa-bor-handbook"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta &amp; Company Ltd |isbn=9780702159237 |chapter=Chapter Thirty-three: States of Emergency |pages=798–806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a state of emergency the President has the power to make emergency regulations "necessary or expedient" to restore peace and order and end the emergency. This power can be delegated to other authorities. Emergency measures can violate the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], but only to a limited extent. Some rights are inviolable, including amongst others the rights to life and to human dignity; the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or religion; the prohibition of torture or inhuman punishment; and the right of accused people to a fair trial. Any violation of a constitutional right must be strictly required by the emergency. Emergency measures may not indemnify the government or individuals for illegal actions. They may impose criminal penalties, but not exceeding three years' imprisonment. They may not require military service beyond that required by the ordinary laws governing the defence force. An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] or the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]]. The courts have the power to determine the validity of any emergency measure.

The constitution places strict limits on any [[detention without trial]] during a state of emergency. A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. He or she must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person. The provisions on detention without trial do not apply to [[prisoners of war]] in an international conflict; instead they must be treated in accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]] and other international law.

===Spain===
In Spain, there are three degrees of state of emergency (''estado de emergencia'' in Spanish): ''alarma'' (alarm or alert), ''excepción'' (exception[al circumstance]) and ''sitio'' (siege). They are named by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|constitution]], which limits which rights may be suspended, but regulated by the "[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo4-1981.html Ley Orgánica 4/1981]" ([[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Law]]).

On December 4, 2010, the first state of alert was declared following the [[Spanish air traffic controllers strike|air traffic controllers strike]]. It was the first time since the [[Francoist Spain|Francisco Franco's regime]] that a state of emergency was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11918008 | work=BBC | title=Striking Spain air traffic controllers return to work | date=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] is able to proclaim emergency regulations under the ''Public Security Ordinance'' in the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|constitution]] in order to preserve public security and public order; suppression of [[mutiny]], [[riot]] or [[civil unrest|civil commotion]]; or maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. These regulations last for one month unless confirmed otherwise by [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl-nat/a24d1cf3344e99934125673e00508142/afad7ae740f9b625c12577370039c9e1/$FILE/Public%20Security%20Ordinance.pdf|title=Constitution of Sri Lanka|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
According to Art. 185 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] The [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] (Bundesrat) can call up in their own competence military personnel of maximum 4000 [[militia]] for three weeks to safeguard inner or outer security (called Federal Intervention or Federal Execution, respectively). A larger number of soldiers or of a longer duration is subject to [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|parliamentary]] decision. For deployments within Switzerland the principle of subsidiarity rules: as a first step, unrest has to be overcome with the aid of cantonal police units.

===Syria===
An emergency prevailed in [[Syria]] from 1962 to 2011. Originally predicated on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|conflict with Israel]], the emergency acted to centralize authority in the presidency and the national security apparatus while silencing public dissent. The emergency was terminated in response to protests that preceded the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Under the 2012 constitution, the president may pass an emergency decree with a 2/3 concurrence of his ministers, provided that he presents it to the legislature for constitutional review.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
A state of emergency was declared in 1970 during the [[Black Power Revolution]] by then Prime Minister [[Eric Williams]]. During the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt|attempted state coup]] by the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]] against the NAR government of the then Prime Minister [[A. N. R. Robinson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/BREAKING-NEWS-State-of-Emergency-declared-128160123 ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/STATE-OF-EMERGENCY-DAY-3-128333238 ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state of emergency was declared during the coup attempt and for a period after the coup.

On August 4, 1995, a state of emergency was declared to remove the [[List of Speakers of the House of Representatives of Trinidad and Tobago|Speaker of the House]] Occah Seepaul by Prime Minister [[Patrick Manning]] during a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsday.co.tt/crime_and_court/0,146738.html|title=Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday : newsday.co.tt :|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had attempted to remove the speaker via a no-confidence motion, which failed. The state of emergency was used to remove the speaker using the emergency powers granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/05/world/world-news-briefs-trinidad-house-speaker-put-under-house-arrest.html|title=World News Briefs; Trinidad House Speaker Put Under House Arrest|date=5 August 1995|work=Reuters|accessdate=13 May 2016|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime Minister [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]] announced a state of emergency on 22 August 2011 at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm in an attempt to crack down on the trafficking of illegal drugs and firearms, in addition to gangs. The decision of the President, [[George Maxwell Richards]], to issue the proclamation for the state of emergency was debated in [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|the country's Parliament]] as required by the Constitution on September 2, 2011 and passed by the required simple majority of the House of Representatives. On September 4 the Parliament extended the state of emergency for a further 3 months. It ended in December 2011.

===Turkey===
{{Main article|Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey}}
Since the foundation of the Republic of [[Turkey]] in 1923 the [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] conducted three [[coup d'état|''coups d'état'']] and announced [[martial law]]. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency that lasted until November 2002.
The latest state of emergency was declared by President Erdogan on 20 July 2016 following a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016 by a faction of the country's armed forces.

===United Kingdom===
In [[the United Kingdom]], only the [[British Sovereign]], on the advice of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] is able to proclaim emergency regulations under the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] in case of any seriously fatal [[threats]] to their human welfare, their human society, and their environment, such as [[warfare]] or [[terrorism]]. These regulations last for seven days unless confirmed otherwise by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].
A state of emergency was last invoked in 1974 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] in response to increasing [[industrial action]].

===United States===
{{Further information|Senate Report 93-549|Insurrection Act|National Emergencies Act}}
The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] explicitly provides some emergency powers:
* Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.
* Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' "when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it."
* [[Felony]] charges may be brought without presentment or [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] in cases arising "in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger."
* A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if "actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay."

Aside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The [[National Emergencies Act]] regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency.
Presidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

A state [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or local [[mayor]] may declare a state of emergency within his or her [[jurisdiction]]. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on December 10, 2015, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state Governor [[Jay Inslee]] declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington gov. declares weather emergency|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/10/washington-gov-declares-weather-emergency/77081310/|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=USA Today|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1977 [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of [[Iran]]. Another ongoing national emergency, declared after the [[September 11 attacks]], authorizes the president to retain or reactivate military personnel beyond their normal term of service.&lt;ref&gt;US Presidential Proclamation 7463&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!--
    Natural disasters happen all the time. While an emergency may be declared as a result, it usually doesn't require mentioning here.

{{voting}}

'''Straight-ticket voting''' or '''straight-party voting''' is the practice of [[voting]] for every candidate that a [[political party]] has on a general election [[ballot]].  In general, straight-ticket voting was a very common occurrence until around the 1960s and 1970s.  Since that time, straight-ticket voting has declined in the United States among the general voting population; however, strong partisans (that is, strong party identifiers) have remained straight-ticket voters.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, Marjorie Randon. Party Politics in America 12th ed. 2007: Longman Classics in Political Science. Pages 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the parties, it was nearly impossible not to vote on a straight-party line vote. Voters would receive a colored ballot with that party's nominees on it.

== Straight-ticket voting in individual states ==

The straight-ticket voting option differs slightly from state to state.

=== Michigan ===

General-election ballots in Michigan have three sections:

* The partisan section, which includes candidates for partisan offices;
* The non-partisan section, which includes candidates for judgeships, most municipal offices, and school boards; and
* The proposals section, which includes state and local ballot issues.

Voters in Michigan had long been able to vote a straight ticket or a split ticket (voting for individual candidates in individual offices).

Straight-ticket voting only involved the partisan section of the ballot, meaning that if an individual wished to vote in a non-partisan race or for or against a proposal, they had to cast those votes individually. One area in which this issue received attention was in races for the [[Michigan Supreme Court]]. All parties on the ballot can nominate candidates for Justice of the Supreme Court at their party conventions (2–3 months before the election for primary-eligible parties, or before the August primary for alternative parties which nominate only at conventions or county caucuses).  However, the races appear on the ballot in the nonpartisan section, meaning that a straight-ticket vote for either of these parties would not include a vote for that party's candidates for Supreme Court.

The [[Michigan Legislature]] passed and Governor [[Rick Snyder]] signed SB 13 on January 5, 2015, which repeals and abolishes straight-ticket voting in the state. This follows failed attempts to abolish it in 1964 and 2001-2002 after voter referenda repealing abolition. With a $5 million appropriation in SB 13, however, a voter referendum is no longer possible due to a constitutional prohibition on referenda on bills appropriating moneys by the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/05/snyder-signs-bill-eliminating-straight-ticket-voting/78302866/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2016/01/gov_rick_snyder_signs_bill_eli.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Michigan voters passed a ballot proposal that restored straight-ticket voting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/michigan-voting-proposal-3-results/1885266002/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Carolina ===

North Carolina had an option for voting "straight party" (using the term from an NC ballot) that did not include a vote for the President and Vice President of the United States, through the 2012 elections. A [[voter ID]] law enacted in 2013 abolished all straight-ticket voting in the state, and went into effect in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20130812/governor-mccrory-signs-popular-voter-id-law Governor McCrory Signs Popular Voter ID into Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v8.pdf NC General Assembly: SESSION LAW 2013-381]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill eliminating it was HB 589.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the former system, North Carolina made separate selections for the President/Vice President and the straight-party option.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://www.app.sboe.state.nc.us/enrs/samples/DURHAM/8GDURH03.pdf sample ballot from Precinct 3, Durham, North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; This idiosyncrasy on the North Carolina ballot was described by some as "a ballot flaw,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norden |first1=Lawrence |last2=Chen |first2=Margaret |title=How Bad is North Carolina’s Ballot Flaw? The Numbers Say, Pretty Bad. |date=October 21, 2008 |url=http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/archives/how_bad_is_north_carolinas_ballot_flaw_the_numbers_say_pretty_bad/ |publisher=brennancenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially resulting in voters failing to cast a vote for President and Vice President when doing so was their intent. It was introduced in the 1960s to shore up Democrats at the state level as Republicans were gaining strength at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Year's Butterfly Ballot |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/opinion/27mon2.html?ref=opinion |newspaper=Nytimes.com |date=October 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 presidential election, there was a 3.15% "undervote" (i.e. (total voter turnout - total votes for President and Vice President) / total voter turnout); in the 2004 presidential election, there was a 2.57% undervote. This means that in raw numbers, more than 92,000 North Carolina voters in the 2000 election turned out to vote but did not vote for president; similarly, in 2004, more than 75,000 North Carolina voters turned out to vote but not vote for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Institute for Southern Studies |title=Voting Rights Watch: Could confusing ballots swing the presidential election in NC? |date=October 20, 2008|url= http://southernstudies.org/facingsouth/2008/10/voting-rights-watch-could-confusing.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texas ===
[[File:Straight Party voting on Harris County, Texas ballot in 2008 (299101265).jpg|thumb|Straight-party option on Texas ballot in the 2008 general election]]
In Texas, a vote for a straight-party ticket casts votes for all party candidates in all races where the party is fielding a candidate and the voter is eligible to cast a vote, from the President/Vice President (or Governor) to the county constable or justice of the peace. On June 1, 2017, Governor [[Greg Abbott]] signed into law House Bill 25, which eliminates the straight-ticket voting option in Texas for all races beginning in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCullough|first1=Jolie|title=Gov. Abbott signs bill to eliminate straight-ticket voting beginning in 2020|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/01/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-bill-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/|website=TexasTribune.org|publisher=Texas Tribune, Inc.|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter, however, may vote a straight-party ticket and subsequently cast an individual vote in a particular race.  This may happen in cases where
#the voter's party did not field a candidate in a specific race, and the voter wants to cast a vote in that race for one of the candidates from another party, and/or
#the voter does not wish to support the party's candidate in a specific race, but wishes to vote for another candidate in that race.  (However, Texas does not have a "none of the above" option; in a case where a voter wishes not to vote for any candidate in a race where his/her party is fielding one, the voter must cast a vote in each individual race separately and cannot choose the straight-party option.)  An individual vote will override the straight-party vote, but only in those specific races where an individual vote is cast.

Straight-party voting is only available in the general election for partisan elections.  It is not available for:
*party primary elections
*non-partisan races (such as City Council or School Board elections); even if a slate of candidates is endorsed by a particular group the slate cannot be elected on a single ticket, each candidate must be selected individually.
*ballot issues (such as an amendment to the [[Texas Constitution]] or a measure to approve bonds and assess taxes for their repayment), even if a political party officially endorses or opposes such an amendment.

In those cases where a partisan election is combined with a non-partisan election and/or ballot issues, the voter can vote straight-party in the partisan portion, but then must vote individually in the other portion(s).&lt;ref&gt;Texas Election Code, Section 52.071&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Virginia ===

In West Virginia, voting "straight party" included a vote for all candidates of the party voters selected, including the President and Vice President of the United States. Non-partisan candidates had to be voted separately. In 2015, however, straight-ticket voting was eliminated as an option on ballots through an Act of the State Legislature signed by Governor [[Earl Ray Tomblin]], SB 249.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
The [[Seneca Nation of Indians]], which operates under a republican form of government on reservations within the bounds of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], offers a straight-ticket voting option. To qualify, a political party must field candidates in each seat up for election in a given year. In practice, only the Seneca Party, which has been the [[dominant-party system|dominant party]] in the nation's politics for decades, has ever received the straight-ticket option. Opponents of the Seneca Party have accused the party of using the straight-ticket option to eavesdrop on voters and punish them with the loss of their jobs if they do not use it, also using the promise of jobs to those running in opposing parties to get them to drop out and deny those parties the straight-ticket option.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rick (October 26, 2016).

In the United States, the phrase '''testing the waters''' is used to describe someone who is exploring the feasibility of becoming a candidate for political office.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |accessdate=July 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703075138/http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |archivedate=July 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/24/campaign-finance-law-2016_n_6932834.html |title='Testing The Waters': The Unseen Significance Of A Candidate Cliche |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Testing the waters" activities are to be paid for with candidate-permissible funds.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; Once an individual begins to campaign or decides to become a candidate, funds that were raised or spent to "test the waters" apply to the $5,000 threshold for qualifying as a candidate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; This is because there is a [[federal law]] that once an individual raises or spends $5,000 for a campaign, they are required to register as a [[federal candidate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/illinois/deerfield/nancy-rotering-accused-violating-federal-campaign-law-0 |title=Nancy Rotering Accused of Violating Federal Campaign Law By Conservative Group &amp;#124; Deerfield, IL Patch |publisher=Patch.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once that threshold is exceeded, the individual must register with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) (candidates for the [[United States House of Representatives]]) or the [[Secretary of the Senate]] (candidates for the [[United States Senate]]), and begin to file reports (including in the first report all activity that occurred prior to reaching the $5,000 threshold).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Once an individual registers as a federal candidate, election restrictions apply, including 2,700 dollars on contributions.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/politics/jeb-bush-taking-his-time-tests-the-legal-definition-of-candidate.html|title=Jeb Bush, Taking His Time, Tests the Legal Definition of Candidate|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, once registered as a candidate, individuals cannot coordinate with [[political action committee]]s (PACs) or [[Super PAC]]s under [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-eyes-new-role-for-his-super-pac-during-2016-campaign/ |title=Jeb Bush eyes new role for his super PAC during 2016 campaign |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |publisher=Cbsnews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting on "testing the waters"==
On July 1st, it was reported that Nancy Rotering allegedly received donations for her congressional campaign in excess of $5,000 as early as January and did not officially register as a candidate with the FEC until March.

On June 18, 2015, it was reported that [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] had formed a "testing the waters" committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovelace |first=Ryan |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/scott-walker-forms-a-testing-the-waters-committee/article/2566521 |title=Scott Walker forms a 'testing the waters' committee |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2015-06-18 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2015, it as reported that the [[Campaign Legal Center]], a nonpartisan legal organization, filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission against Democrat [[Martin O’Malley]] and Republicans Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker alleging violations of federal law “testing the waters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/campaign/243828-republican-fec-commissioner-admittedly-blocking-complaints |title=Republican FEC commissioner admittedly blocking complaints against Republicans |publisher=TheHill |date=2015-06-04 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2015, it was reported that as of June 3, [[Jeb Bush]] was still "testing the waters", and had not registered as a federal candidate.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

On April 9, 2015, it was reported that [[Rick Santorum]] set up a "testing the waters" account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/9/rick-santorum-sets-testing-waters-account-ahead-po/ |title=Rick Santorum sets up 'testing the waters' account ahead of possible 2016 W.H. bid |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tradition-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|[[Olin Levi Warner]], ''Tradition'' (1895). Bronze [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the main entrance, Library of Congress, [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]

A '''tradition''' is a [[belief]] or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past.&lt;ref name="Green1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas A. Green |title=Folklore: an encyclopedia of beliefs, customs, tales, music, and art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7Wfhws3dFAC&amp;pg=PA800 |access-date=5 February 2011 |year=1997|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-87436-986-1|pages=800–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt; Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like [[court dress|lawyers' wig]]s or military officers' [[spur]]s), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word ''tradition'' itself derives from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.  

The phrase "according to tradition", or "by tradition", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. ''Tradition'' is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs." This tradition may never be proven or disproven. In another example, "[[King Arthur]], by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories."  Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature. 

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in [[social sciences]] such as anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology.

The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], and also strands of many world religions including [[traditional Catholicism]]. In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. A number of factors can exacerbate the [[loss of tradition]], including industrialization, [[globalization]], and the assimilation or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups. In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of [[modernity]] and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.

The English word ''tradition'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''traditio'', the noun from the verb ''tradere'' (to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping); it was originally used in [[Roman law]] to refer to the concept of legal transfers and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congar2004"/&gt; According to [[Anthony Giddens]] and others, the modern meaning of tradition evolved during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, in opposition to modernity and [[progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-3"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA3 3–6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA3 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other generic terms, there are many definitions of tradition.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA12 12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congar2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yves Congar|title=The meaning of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBDnQg5zw8oC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2004|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-1-58617-021-9|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt; The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas; the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs, objects or customs performed or believed in the past, originating in it, transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next, and are performed or believed in the present.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;

Tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are [[prehistory|Prehistoric]], with lost or [[arcane]] origins, existing from ''[[time immemorial]]''.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-15"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA15 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a [[writing system]]. Tools to aid this process include [[figures of speech|poetic devices]] such as [[rhyme]] and [[alliteration]]. The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an [[oral tradition]]. Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been "invented" by humans) at some point.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"/&gt; Traditions are often presumed to be [[ancient]], unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less "natural" than is presumed.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three [[generation]]s are required for a practice, belief or object to be seen as traditional.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-15"/&gt; Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another, often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA1 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day, and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA2 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Tradition changes slowly, with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-14"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA14 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change, and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations, it will be seen as unchanged.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-14"/&gt;

There are various origins and fields of tradition; they can refer to:

==Invention of tradition==
{{main article|Invented tradition}}
The term "[[invention of tradition]]", introduced by [[E. J. Hobsbawm]], refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1-2"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA1 1–2]&lt;/ref&gt;  A tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal, commercial, political, or [[National interest|national self-interest]], as was done in colonial Africa; or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event, rather than developing and spreading organically in a population, as in the case of the white [[wedding dress]], which only became popular after [[Queen Victoria]] wore a white gown at her wedding to [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingraham|first=Chrys|title=White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-95194-4|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the [[Palace of Westminster]] (location of the [[British Parliament]]) in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Gothic style]].&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1-2"/&gt; Similarly, most of the traditions associated with [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]], seen as rooted deep in history, actually date to 19th century.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces.&lt;ref name=invention&gt;[[Terence Ranger]], ''The Invention of Tradition in Colonial Africa'', in {{cite book|author1=E. J. (Eric J.) Hobsbawm| author1-link = E. J. Hobsbawm|author2=T. O. (Terence O.) Ranger| author2-link = Terrence Ranger |title=The Invention of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=4 February 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43773-8|pages=211–263|date=31 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requiring [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the [[colonial power]] would often invent a "tradition" which they could use to legitimize their own position. For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job. Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation.

Invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-7"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA7 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see [[national dish]]). [[Expatriate]] and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation.

==In scholarly discourse==
In science, tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author's thoughts to that of his or her field.&lt;ref name = Kurz129&gt;Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a "rational theory of tradition" applied to science which was fundamentally sociological. For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it.&lt;ref name = Kurz129/&gt; Unlike [[myth]], which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper.&lt;ref name = Kurz129-130&gt;Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Thomas Kuhn]], who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977, a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is, historically, what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embracement of tradition.&lt;ref name = Kurz129-130/&gt;

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in [[social sciences]]—chiefly anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology—with somewhat different meanings in different fields. It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Edward Shils]] explored the concept in detail.&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin"/&gt; Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, "tradition" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals.

Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines.&lt;ref name="Patel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sujata Patel|title=The ISA Handbook of Diverse Sociological Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWZGj7WghCEC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84787-402-3|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropology===
Tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of "tradition in traditional societies".&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Boyer|title=Tradition as truth and communication: a cognitive description of traditional discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7cu0joBSM8C&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37417-0|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is however no "theory of tradition", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical).&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt; There are however dissenting views; scholars such as [[Pascal Boyer]] argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
In [[archaeology]], the term ''tradition'' is a set of [[archaeological culture|cultures]] or [[archaeological industry|industries]] which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time. The term is especially common in the study of [[American archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin" /&gt;

===Biology===
Biologists, when examining groups of non-humans, have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next. Tradition is defined in biology as "a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring (i.e., is performed repeatedly over a period of time), that is shared among two or more members of a group, that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners", and has been called a precursor to "culture" in the anthropological sense.&lt;ref name = Fragaszy2&gt;Fragaszy and Perry 2, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed. Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}
In the field of [[musicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]] tradition refers to the belief systems, repertoire, techniques, style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations. Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns. Along with a sense of history, traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time.
While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being 'the scholarly study of music'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duckles|first=Vincent|title=Musicology.|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46710pg1|work=Grove Music Online.

'Tradition, or traditions, can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wide-ranging historical perspective.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Sociology===
The concept of tradition, in early sociological research (around the turn of the 19th and 20th century), referred to that of the [[traditional society]], as contrasted by the more modern [[industrial society]].&lt;ref name=slang&gt;S. Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B. Baltes, Editor(s)-in-Chief, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences'', Pergamon, Oxford, 2001, Pages 15829-15833, {{ISBN|978-0-08-043076-8}}, {{doi|10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3}}. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7MRM-4MT09VJ-4PM/2/1eb81ee3e63af98afa7a48ecacfb64a6 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was most notably portrayed in [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of [[traditional authority]] and modern [[rational-legal authority]].&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; In more modern works, One hundred years later, sociology sees tradition as a [[social construct]] used to contrast past with the present and as a form of [[rationality]] used to justify certain course of action.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

Traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business, [[division of labor]] influenced primarily by age, gender, and status, high position of custom in the system of values, self-sufficiency, preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment, relative [[autarky]].&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Early theories positing the simple, [[unilineal evolution]] of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

In 1981 Edward Shils in his book ''Tradition'' put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; According to Shils, tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

Another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see [[Rationality#Theories of rationality|theories of rationality]]), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by [[Raymond Boudon]] in his book ''Action''.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as "it has always been that way".&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the [[appeal to tradition]] (or ''argumentum ad antiquitatem''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Texas University |title=Is-Ought fallacy |url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/fallacies/isought.htm |work=Fallacies Definitions |publisher=Texas State University Department of Philosophy |accessdate=2008-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826004350/http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/fallacies/isought.htm |archivedate=26 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes the form "this is right because we've always done it this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the "tradition" being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity.

===Philosophy===
The idea of tradition is important in philosophy. Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe. Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following [[Martin Heidegger]], call 'the tradition', which began with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition', instead posing [[Aristotelianism]] as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others.

==In political and religious discourse==
[[File:Wigilia potrawy 76.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions, as is the case with this distinctly Polish Christmas meal, decor with [[Christmas tree#Poland|Christmas tree]], a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century]]
{{main article|Traditional values|Traditionalist conservatism}}
The concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt; Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition. For example, the term "[[traditionalist Catholic]]" refers to those, such as [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Lefebvre]], who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962–65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marty|first=Martin E.|title=Fundamentalisms observed|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-50878-8|page=92|author2=R. Scott Appleby }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] are referred to as ''Ahlus Sunnah wa Al-Jamā‘ah'' ({{lang-ar|أهل السنة والجماعة}}), literally "people of the tradition [of [[Muhammad]]] and the community", emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition.

More generally, tradition has been used as a way of determining the [[political spectrum]], with [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply ''traditionalism''), which emphasizes the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]], and the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–875.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of [[individualism]], liberalism, modernity, and [[social progress]], but promote cultural and educational renewal,&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and revive interest in the church, the family, the state and local community. This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable, for example, stereotypical views of the [[Feminism|place of women in domestic affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sex Roles|volume=7|issue=2|pages=183–188|doi=10.1007/BF00287804|title=Feminists and traditionalists: An attitudinal comparison|author=M. Dwayne Smith|author2=George D. Self |year=1981|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8122k666286p664/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other societies, especially ones experiencing rapid social change, the idea of what is "traditional" may be widely contested, with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones. Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society; in other cases, tradition is a means of [[othering]] and keeping groups distinct from one another.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;

==In artistic discourse==
In artistic contexts, in the performance of traditional genres (such as [[traditional dance]]), adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer's preferences.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; For artistic endeavors, tradition has been used as a contrast to ''[[creativity]]'', with traditional and [[folk art]] associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition, in contrast to [[fine art]], which is valued for being original and unique. More recent philosophy of art, however, considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;

==Relationship to other concepts==
In the social sciences, ''tradition'' is often contrasted with ''modernity'', particularly in terms of whole societies. This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change, in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern.&lt;ref name="Gusfield"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition-oriented societies have been characterized as valuing [[filial piety]], harmony and group welfare, stability, and [[interdependence]], while a society exhibiting modernity would value "individualism (with free will and choice), mobility, and progress."&lt;ref name="Bronner"&gt;Bronner, Simon J. "Tradition" in ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''. Ed. William A. Darity, Jr.. Vol. 8. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. p420-422.&lt;/ref&gt; Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity, Anthony Giddens, sees tradition as something bound to ritual, where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition.&lt;ref name = Giddens&gt;Giddens, "Living in a Post-Traditional Society" 64&lt;/ref&gt; Gusfield and others, though, criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified, arguing that tradition is dynamic, heterogeneous, and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals.&lt;ref name="Gusfield"/&gt;

Tradition should be differentiated from ''customs, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], laws, [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], routines, rules'' and similar concepts. Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable, they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt; Whereas justification for tradition is [[ideology|ideological]], the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, customs, routines, conventions, rules and such can evolve into traditions, but that usually requires that they stop having (primarily) a practical purpose.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; For example, wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable; [[spur]]s worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt;

==Preservation==
[[File:GOOD SHABBES -.jpg|thumb|Woman welcoming the [[Shabbat#Welcoming Sabbath|Shabbat]], a more than 3300 year old tradition.]]

In many countries, concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost. A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, [[globalization]], and the [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups.&lt;ref name="UVic"&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Tracey|title=New Zealand identities: departures and destinations |year=2005 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=0-86473-517-0|editor=James H. Liu|page=40|chapter=Maori Identities: Fixed, Fluid, Forced}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presstv.ir/detail/162937.html |title=PressTV&amp;nbsp;– Iran plans to preserve Nowruz traditions |work=presstv.ir |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/11/bahrain.pearling.industry/index.html |title=Bahrain seeks to preserve ancient pearling traditions |publisher=CNN |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as [[Cornish language|Cornish]] under the auspices of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6554120/Cornish-street-signs-to-be-translated.html|accessdate=6 February 2010|title=Cornish street signs to be translated|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |author=Richard Savill|date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the charter holds that these languages "contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe's cultural wealth and traditions". The Charter goes on to call for "the use or adoption... of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|date=5 November 1992|accessdate=6 February 2010|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[UNESCO]] includes both "oral tradition" and "traditional manifestations" in its definition of a country's cultural properties and heritage. It therefore works to preserve tradition in countries such as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/brasilia/culture-in-brazil/world-heritage-in-brazil/|title=World Heritage in Brazil |publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], certain artworks, structures, craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the Japanese government to be a precious legacy of the Japanese people, and are protected under the Japanese Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf| title =Cultural Properties for Future Generations| date =June 2007| work =Administration of Cultural Affairs in Japan ― Fiscal 2009| publisher =[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090327083232/http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf| archivedate =27 March 2009| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as "[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|National Living Treasures]]", and encourages the preservation of their craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.sfgate.com/1999-05-30/books/17688560_1_living-treasures-art-works-authors |title=Treasures of Japan&amp;nbsp;– Its Living Artists|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=30 May 1999 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For native peoples like the [[Māori people|Māori]] in New Zealand, there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it; the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition.&lt;ref name="UVic"/&gt;

==Traditional cultural expressions==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international relations '''violent non-state actors''' ('''VNSA''') (also known as '''non-state armed actors''' or '''non-state armed groups''') are individuals and groups that are wholly or partly independent of [[state government]]s and which threaten or use violence to achieve their goals.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}}

VNSAs vary widely in their goals, size, and methods. They may include [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics cartels]], popular [[liberation movements]], religious and ideological organizations, [[corporations]] (e.g. [[Private military company|private military contractors]]), self-defence [[militia]], and [[Paramilitary|paramilitary groups]] established by state governments to further their interests.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}}{{Sfn|Chatham House|2016|p=8}}

While some VNSAs oppose governments, others are allied to them.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}} Some VNSAs are organized as paramilitary groups, adopting methods and structure similar to those of state [[Military|armed forces]]. Others may be informally structured and use violence in other ways, such as kidnapping, using [[improvised explosive device]]s, or [[Security hacker|hacking]] into computer systems.

==Description==
{{See also|Non-state actor}}

[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_Graffiti.jpg|thumb|upright|[[MS-13]] gang graffiti.]]

Thomas, Kiser, and Casebeer asserted in 2005 that "VNSA play a prominent, often destabilizing role in nearly every humanitarian and political crisis faced by the international community".{{sfn|Thomas|Kiser|Casebeer|2005|p={{page needed|date=October 2012}}}} As a new type of actor in international relations, VNSAs represent a departure from the traditional [[Westphalian sovereignty]] system of states in two ways: by providing an alternative to state governance; and by challenging the state's [[monopoly of violence]].

Phil Williams stated in 2008 that in the 21st century, they "have become a pervasive challenge to nation-states".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep4"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams argues that VNSAs develop out of poor state governance but also contribute to the further undermining of governance by the state. He explains that when weak states are "unable to create or maintain the loyalty and allegiance of their populations", "individuals and groups typically revert to or develop alternative patterns of affiliation".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6" /&gt; This causes the family, tribe, clan or other group to become "the main reference points for political action, often in opposition to the state".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6" /&gt; According to Williams, globalization has "not only... challenged individual state capacity to manage economic affairs, it has also provided facilitators and force multipliers for VNSAs".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Transnational flows of arms, for example, are no longer under the exclusive surveillance of states. Globalization helps VNSAs develop transnational social capital and alliances as well as funding opportunities.&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=6—7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used in several papers published by the [[US military]].{{sfn|Casebeer|Thomas|2002}}{{sfn|Bartolomei|Casebeer|Thomas|2004}}{{sfn|Thomas|Casebeer|2004}}{{sfn|Shultz|Farah|Lochard|2004|}}

== Types ==
Some common and influential types of VNSAs include:
* Criminal organizations. [[Drug cartel]]s, for example, may carry out assassinations, kidnappings, thefts, extortions; operate protection rackets; and [[wikt:turf war|defend their ''turf'']] from rival groups and the military.
* [[Social movement|People's movements]] or sections of them that have chosen [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] (also known as [[asymmetric warfare]]) to pursue their aims. An example is the [[Naxalite–Maoist insurgency|Naxalite-Maoist insurgency]] in central India.{{Sfn|Economist|2006|p=}}
* [[Private military company|Private military companies]], and corporations that either have their own, or hire, private military services.{{Sfn|Daugaard|2012|p=}} An example is [[Floating armoury|floating armouries]] in the Indian Ocean.{{Sfn|Holtom and Chapsos|2015|p=}}
* Religious or ideological groups, such as [[Boko Haram]] in and around Nigeria, that espouse armed violence as a moral or sacred duty.{{Sfn|Drake|1998|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=30-31}}
* Citizen militia, which may form to protect a locality from (or threaten it with) attack, such as the [[Anti-balaka|anti-balaka movement]] in the Central African Republic.{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016b|p=4}}
* [[Paramilitary]] groups, which make use of military methods and structures to pursue their agenda, such as the now-decommissioned Irish Republican Army.
* [[Warlord]]s, who are leaders using armed violence to exercise military, economic, and political control over territory within a sovereign state. Warlords have a long history in Afghanistan, for example.{{Sfn|Coll|2004|p=4}}
Phil Williams, in an overview article, identifies five types of VNSAs:&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep9-16"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=9—16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Warlord]]s
* [[Militia]]s
* [[Insurgency|Insurgencies]]
* [[List of designated terrorist organizations|Terrorist organizations]]
* [[Criminal organization]]s and gangs

== Relationship to terrorism ==
There is no commonly accepted [[Definitions of terrorism|definition of "terrorism"]],{{Sfn|Emmerson|2016|p=10-11}}{{Sfn|Halibozek et al|2008|p=4-5}}{{Sfn|Williamson|2009|p=38}} and the term is frequently used as a political tactic to denounce opponents whose status as [[Terrorism|terrorists]] is disputed.{{Sfn|Sinclair and Antonius|2012|p=14}} An attempt at a global definition appears in the working draft of Comprehensive Convention Against International Terrorism, which defines terrorism as a type of act, rather than as a type of group.{{Sfn|UN General Assembly|2005|p=8-9}} Specifically, "terrorism" in the draft refers to the threatened or actual intentional injury to others, and serious damage to property resulting in major economic loss:{{quote|when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.{{Sfn|UN General Assembly|2005|p=8-9}}}}

Since the definition encompasses the actions of some violent non-state actors (and of some state actors) and not others, disagreements remain and the treaty has yet to be agreed, {{as of|lc=yes|2015}}.{{Sfn|European Parliament|2015|p=}} For example, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] has called for acts of terrorism to be distinguished from:{{quote|the legitimate struggle of peoples under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination in the exercise of their right to [[self-determination]] in accordance with the principles of [[international law]]".{{Sfn|European Parliament|2015|p=}}}}

== Use of children ==

{{See also|Children in the military|Child soldiers in Africa|Impact of war on children}}

Violent non-state actors have drawn international condemnation for relying heavily on children under the age of 18 as combatants, scouts, porters, spies, informants, and in other roles{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016a|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=}} (although many state armed forces also recruit children).{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2012|p=}} In 2017, for example, the United Nations identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, [[Child soldiers in the Central African Republic|Central African Republic]], [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, The Philippines, [[Child soldiers in Somalia|Somalia]], South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Not all armed groups use children, and approximately 60 that used to do so have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999.{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016a|p=4}} For example, by 2017 the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) in the [[Philippines]] had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks,{{Sfn|UNICEF|2017|p=}} and the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC-EP]] guerilla movement in Colombia agreed in 2016 to stop recruiting children.{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=41}} In other situations, the use of children was increasing in 2017, particularly in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria, where Islamist militants and groups opposing them intensified efforts to recruit children.{{Sfn|Human Rights Watch|2016|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=}}

==Humanitarian engagement==

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] propose that engagement with VNSAs, which they call armed non-state actors, is essential to humanitarian efforts in conflicts. They claim that it is often necessary to do so to facilitate access to those affected and to provide humanitarian assistance.{{sfn|Jackson|2012}} However, humanitarian agencies often fail to engage strategically with VNSAs. This tendency has strengthened since the end of the Cold War, partly because of the strong discouragement of humanitarian engagement with VNSAs in counterterrorism legislation and donor funding restrictions. In their opinion, further study is necessary to identify ways in which humanitarian agencies can develop productive dialogue with VNSAs.{{sfn|Jackson|2012}}

The International Security Department and the International Law Programme at Chatham House are seeking to understand the dynamics that will determine support for a principle-based approach to engagement by humanitarian actors with VNSAs.{{sfn|''Chatham House''}}
