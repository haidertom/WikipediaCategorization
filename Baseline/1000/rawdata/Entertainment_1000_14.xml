'''''A Força do Querer''''' (English title: '''''Edge of Desire'''''&lt;!--; [[literal and figurative language|literal meaning]]: '''''The Force of Will'''''--&gt;) is a Brazilian [[telenovela]] produced and aired by [[Rede Globo]]. It was created by [[Glória Perez]] and directed by Rogério Gomes and [[Pedro Vasconcellos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gshow.globo.com/tv/noticia/2016/12/nova-novela-das-9-conheca-trama-e-os-personagens-de-forca-do-querer.html|title= Nova novela das 9: conheça a trama e os personagens de 'A Força do Querer'|website=Gshow Globo|language=Portuguese|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered on 3 April 2017, replacing ''[[A Lei do Amor]].'' The show ran for 29 weeks with a total of 172 episodes and ended on 20 October 2017, replaced by ''[[O Outro Lado do Paraíso]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1news.com.br/noticia/7450/diomax-martins/entretenimento/a-forca-do-querer-saiba-quando-estreia-a-substituta-de-a-lei-do-amor|title=Saiba quando estreia A Força do Querer, nova novela da Rede Globo no horário nobre.|accessdate=3 March 2017|website=1 News|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
[[File:Rio Negro - Praia do Boto Rosa - panoramio.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Indaruba served as a filming site for the fictitious town of Parazinho.]] 
In April 2016, [[Glória Perez]] announced her next telenovela, due to premiere in the first half of 2017. She also stated that it would be different from the ones she had produced 20 years previously, which had mainly featured different settings and culture-oriented storylines. ''A Força do Querer'' mainly features romance and is primarily shot in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvefamosos.uol.com.br/colunas/flavio-ricco/2016/12/03/a-forca-do-querer--novela-da-gloria-perez-tem-titulo-novo-e-definitivo.htm|title=A Forca do Querer, novela da Gloria Perez tem-titulo novo e definitivo|first=Flávio|last=Ricco|date=3 December 2016|accessdate=2 June 2017|website=TV e Famosos|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paolla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emais.estadao.com.br/noticias/tv,paolla-oliveira-confirma-que-sera-protagonista-da-proxima-novela-de-gloria-perez,10000027260|title=Paolla Oliveira sera protagonista da proxima novela de Glória Perez|accessdate=2 June 2017|website=E Mais|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally titled ''À Flor da Pele'' during the early stages of production, it was changed to ''Flor do Querer'' in November 2016 and to the current title in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://observatoriodatelevisao.bol.uol.com.br/noticia-da-tv/2016/11/gloria-perez-justifica-novo-titulo-para-a-flor-da-pele-estava-registrado|title=Glória Perez justifica novo título para À Flor da Pele: "Estava registrado"|accessdate=2 June 2017|website=Observatorio da Televisao|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rd1.com.br/proxima-novela-de-gloria-perez-tem-titulo-alterado-flor-do-querer-deve-ser-escolhido/|title=Próxima novela de Glória Perez tem título alterado; "Flor do Querer" deve ser escolhido|website=RD1|accessdate=2 June 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oplanetatv.clickgratis.com.br/noticias/bastidores/a-forca-do-querer-e-o-titulo-definitivo-da-novela-de-gloria-perez.html|title=A Força do Querer é o título definitivo da novela de Glória Perez|accessdate=2 June 2017|website=O Planeta TV|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casting ===
[[Paolla Oliveira]] was the first to be cast for the project, and was announced to star in the telenovela in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistaquem.globo.com/QUEM-News/noticia/2016/03/paolla-oliveira-sera-policial-em-nova-novela.html|title=Paolla Oliveira sera policial em nova novela|website=Revistaquem Globo|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paolla" /&gt; [[Fábio Assunção]] was originally cast to portray Eugênio but later declined in order to star in an upcoming television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kogut.oglobo.globo.com/noticias-da-tv/coluna/noticia/2016/06/fabio-assuncao-sera-o-mocinho-da-novela-de-gloria-perez.html|title=Fabio Assunção será o mocinho da novela de Gloria Perez|first=Patricia|last=Kogut|date=18 June 2016|work=Kogut O Globo|accessdate=15 May 2016|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Stulbach]] was then cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kogut.oglobo.globo.com/noticias-da-tv/coluna/noticia/2016/11/dan-stulbach-voltara-globo-em-papel-que-seria-de-fabio-assuncao.html|title=Dan Stulbach voltará à Globo em papel que seria de Fabio Assunção|first=Florence|last=Manza|work=Patrícia Kogut O Globo|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Leopoldo Pacheco was originally cast as Junqueira but he and Chay Suede preferred ''[[Novo Mundo (telenovela)|Novo Mundo]]''. Suede was the first option to portray Ruy. Daniel Rocha also auditioned for the role of Ruy but [[Filipe Galvão|Fiuk]] was preferred over him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aguinaldosilva.com.br/2016/11/23/reprovado-em-teste-para-a-flor-da-pele-daniel-rocha-entra-para-o-elenco-de-a-lei-do-amor/|title=Reprovado em teste para ‘À Flor da Pele’, Daniel Rocha entra para o elenco de ‘A Lei do Amor’|first=Aguinaldo|last=Silva|date=23 November 2016|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vera Fischer (actress)|Vera Fischer]] was also cast but due to personal differences with the showrunner, she was replaced by [[Betty Faria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entretenimento.r7.com/blogs/keila-jimenez/2017/03/07/vera-fischer-perde-vaga-para-betty-faria-em-novela/|title=Vera Fischer perde vaga para Betty Faria em novela|first=Keila|last=Jimenez|date=7 March 2017|work=Entretenimento|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Bibi was inspired by Fabiana Escobar, known as "queen of pot". Showrunner [[Glória Perez]] initially wanted the character to be the center of a separate miniseries but decided to include it in the telenovela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caras.uol.com.br/tv/gloria-perez-fara-minisserie-sobre-ex-primeira-dama-do-trafico|title=Glória Perez fará minissérie sobre ex-primeira dama do tráfico|first=Flavia|last=Faccini|date=16 April 2014|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extra.globo.com/tv-e-lazer/telinha/em-flor-da-pele-juliana-paes-fara-bandida-inspirada-em-bibi-perigosa-20036599.html|title=Em 'À flor da pele', Juliana Paes fará bandida inspirada em Bibi Perigosa|first=Carla|last=Bittencourt|date=6 September 2016|accessdate=15 May 2017|website=Extra Telinha|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultura.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,autora-planeja-serie-com-dama-da-rocinha-imp-,1553405|title=Autora planeja série com dama da Rocinha|first=Cristina|last=Padiglione|accessdate=15 May 2017|website=Cultura|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her role is inspired by a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]], [[Isis Valverde]] was prepared for three months in readiness for her role by Mirella Ferraz a professional in that part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ego.globo.com/famosos/noticia/2016/08/isis-valverde-sera-uma-sereia-na-novela-novela-de-gloria-perez.html|title=Isis Valverde será uma sereia na próxima novela de Glória Perez|first=Luciana |last=Tecidio|work=Ego Globo|date=24 August 2016|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ego.globo.com/televisao/noticia/2017/01/isis-valverde-usou-cauda-de-sereia-de-30kg-para-gravar-forca-do-querer.html|title=Isis Valverde usa cauda de sereia de 30kg para gravar 'A Força do Querer'|first=Victor|last=Hugo|work=Ego Globo|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2018|Does this mean vocal coaching/singing training or something else?}}

== Plot ==
Promising lawyer Caio is considered for administering the Garcia Company, one of the largest in the country. However, when Bibi decides to end their relationship, he leaves everything behind and relocates to the United States. Fifteen years later, Caio returns to Brazil to take up a position in the judiciary and meets once again with Bibi, who failed to complete college and is married to Rubinho. Rubinho goes through a delicate financial condition, as he and Bibi struggle to make ends meet which forces him to enter the world of crime.

Ruy is prepared to take over the company of his father Eugênio, as the only qualified heir. Ruy is engaged to Cibele, who gives him professional and personal stability. When he travels to Parazinho, he is enchanted by Ritinha, a young woman who loves the fascination she exerts upon men and seems to believe herself to be a mermaid. She continues a game of seduction with Ruy despite being engaged to Zeca, a truck driver who loves her intensely despite gossip about her activities. On the day of their wedding he learns of Ritinha's fling with Ruy; fearing his temper, Ritinha runs away with Ruy while Zeca angrily leaves Parazinho.  In another town, Zeca meets Jeiza, a police officer who dreams of becoming a [[mixed martial arts]] fighter.

Meanwhile, Ruy's sister Ivana has been undergoing [[female to male gender reassignment]], causing conflict with their mother, Joyce. Joyce's relationship with Eugênio begins to crumble when he meets Irene, who tries to tempt him away. And Eugênio's older brother Eurico tries to keep everyone under his control though he can't control the gambling addiction of his wife Silvana.

== Controversies ==

=== The state of Pará ===
Since its debut, the telenovela received criticism for not using the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern]] [[Brazilian Portuguese|accents]] in the state of [[Pará]] and the depiction of the state, such as the existence of an aquarium located in Ver-o-Peso. There were varied opinions among the viewers, especially those from Pará. [[Rede Globo]] and show's creator [[Glória Perez]] said that the show was not set in the capital of Pará but in the fictional city of Parazinho and that the work of fiction has no commitment to be true to reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opovo.com.br/divirtase/2017/04/paraenses-criticam-nordestinacao-do-para-em-a-forca-do-querer.html|title=Paraenses criticam nordestinação do Pará em A Força do Querer|work=O Povo|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations on glamorization of drug trafficking ===
The fact that the plot touches on drug trafficking and other crime aroused the idea that the telenovela was unapologetic to such. The show to received a flurry of criticism, mainly by evangelists and conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.terra.com.br/diversao/tv/blog-sala-de-tv/acha-mesmo-que-novela-transforma-uma-pessoa-em-bandido,8343e0c62cc38b4a56197235ac7a27c9t0onos6c.html|title=Acha mesmo que novela transforma uma pessoa em bandido?|accessdate=13 October 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor and Deputy Marco Feliciano said that, "Rede Globo offered a course for banditry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noticias.gospelmais.com.br/feliciano-globo-curso-bandido-a-forca-do-querer-92654.html|title=Marco Feliciano ataca a Globo e diz que emissora promove "curso para bandido" na novela A Força do Querer|work=Noticias|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showrunner Glória Perez responded to the accusations: {{quote|It is something of people to want to put reality under the rug. Bibi became a thug. She is not the trafficker, but she is prosecuted by association with trafficking. Do you see glamour in that? The plot brings an ethical police, quite different from how it is traditionally shown in Brazilian dramas. These people [critics] make me sleepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glória Perez nega glamourização do tráfico em A Força do Querer: "Essa gente me dá sono"|url=https://observatoriodatelevisao.bol.uol.com.br/noticia-da-tv/2017/09/gloria-perez-nega-glamourizacao-do-trafico-em-a-forca-do-querer-essa-gente-me-da-sono|work=|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Transexuality ===
Before the debut of the telenovela, the subject of transexuality was already causing controversy. Catholic organizations asked that Globo not allow this theme in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.opovo.com.br/ancoradouro/bispo-conclama-tsunami-de-e-mails-para-stf-e-tv-globo-contra-aborto-e-ideologia-de-genero/|title=Bispo conclama 'tsunami' de e-mails para STF e TV Globo contra Aborto e Ideologia de Gênero|accessdate=13 October 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme about gender identity, addressed in the plot by the character Ivana was also not accepted by a portion of the audience, among them also evangelists and conservatives. They accused the network of using the telenovela to popularize gender ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noticias.gospelmais.com.br/globo-novela-a-forca-do-querer-ideologia-de-genero-89914.html|title=Globo vai usar novela A Força do Querer, de Glória Perez, para popularizar ideologia de gênero|accessdate=13 October 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, the telenovela had a clear intention to show that it is completely normal to identify as one gender even if one is of the other.

'''''Amusement Today''''' is a monthly periodical that features articles, news, pictures and reviews about all things relating to the [[amusement park]] industry, including parks, [[List of amusement rides|rides]], and ride manufacturers. The trade newspaper, which is based in [[Arlington, Texas]], United States, was founded in January 1997 by Gary Slade, Virgil E. Moore III and Rick Tidrow.&lt;ref name=AT4_11&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1997 | title = Sale of Amusement Today Inc. completed | journal = Amusement Today | volume = 4 | issue = 11 | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, ''Amusement Today'' won the Impact Award in the services category for "Best New Product" from the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] (IAAPA).

'''Anagnorisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|n|ɒr|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀναγνώρισις}}) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the [[hero]]'s sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often [[antagonist]]ic [[fictional character|character]] in [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], "Myth, Fiction, And Displacement" p 25 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tragedy==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', as part of his discussion of [[peripeteia]], Aristotle defined anagnorisis as "a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[catharsis]].

[[File:Lear and Cordelia.jpg|right|thumb|"Lear and Cordelia" by [[Ford Madox Brown]]:  Lear, driven out by his older daughters and rescued by his youngest, realizes their true characters.]]
In the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'') or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero.  

Aristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when [[Oedipus]] killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when [[Iphigeneia in Tauris]] realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them.  Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when [[Medea]] resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.

Another prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in [[Aeschylus]]'s "The Choephoroi" ("[[Libation Bearers]]") when [[Electra]] recognizes her brother, [[Orestes]], after he has returned to [[Argos]] from his exile, at the grave of their father, [[Agamemnon]], who had been murdered at the hands of [[Clytemnestra]], their mother. [[Electra]] convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself.  The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.&lt;ref&gt;
Aeschylus, and Robert Lowell. The Oresteia of Aeschylus. New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Robson Crane Comedy of Errors.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for a performance of ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'':  When the twins, confused with each other throughout the play, recognize each other's existence, the play reaches its happy ending.]]
The section of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies.  A standard plot of the [[New Comedy]] was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the [[tricky slave]].  This plot appears in Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, "Recognition in ''The Winter's Tale''" p 108-9 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and modern usage==
===Mystery===
The earliest use of anagnorisis in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a classical ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its [[twist ending]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Tale of the Three Apples]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist of the story, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
Anagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary ''auteur'' [[M. Night Shyamalan]] uses similar revelations in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power.&lt;ref name="formats"&gt;Ivan Pintor Iranzo. [http://www.upf.edu/materials/depeca/formats/arti6_ing.htm The naked and the dead. The Representation of the dead and the construction of the other in contemporary cinema: The case of M. Night Shyamalan], No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that [[Darth Vader]] is the father of [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book ''Recognitions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Recognitions: A Study in Poetics''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any moment of such crisis / 
one thinks, of course, of those devices / 
which Aristotle said were needed / 
in any poem.  We have heeded / 
Aristotle, and our plot, / 
(beginning, middle, end), has got / 
complications too, and error / 
fit to rouse cathartic terror, / 
protagonists, antagonists, / 
peripiteia, turns and twists. / 
The poet's comments form the choruses, / 
but now it's time for anagnorisis. / 
When Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / 
is his own father's lawful wedded / 
wife, in fact she is his mother, / 
or Iphigenia finds her brother, / 
Discovery or Recognition / 
brings the plot to its fruition.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">'''Antilabe''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀντι "mutually" or "corresponding", λαβή, "grip" or "handle") is a [[rhetoric]]al technique in [[verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] or [[closet drama]], in which a single [[Line (poetry)|verse line]] of dialogue is distributed on two or more [[Character (arts)|characters]], voices, or entities. The verse usually maintains its [[Metre (poetry)|metric]] integrity, while the line fragments spoken by the characters may or may not be complete sentences. In the layout of the text the line fragments following the first one are often indented ("[[dropped line]]") to show the unity of the verse line.

{{Quotation|
'''BRUTUS''':&lt;br /&gt; 
:Peace then. No words.
'''CLITUS''':&lt;br /&gt; 
::::::::I'll rather kill myself.|
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]|[[Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']]}}

These are three sentences spoken by two persons. But it is only one single line in [[blank verse]]:

:Peace '''then'''. No '''words'''. I'll '''ra'''ther '''kill''' my'''self'''.

==In Ancient Greek drama==

"The device originated in [[tragedy|classical tragedy]] as a means of heightening dramatic tension."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, David. ''McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama''. Volume 1. 1972, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; "It figures in almost all the plays of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. It renders dialogue less stately and more agitated: the technique is well suited to scenes of excitement, in which one speaker is repeatedly capping, countering or following up the ideas of another."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R. B. ''Greek Tragic Style: Form, Language and Interpretation''. Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sophokles’ ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]'', for example, "as ''Kreon'' seizes ''Antigone'' (832), they break into an excited lyrical strophe, full of ''antilabe'' in which ''Oedipus'', ''Kreon'', and the chorus participate."&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, Lowell. ''Theatrical Space and Historical Place in Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus''. Maryland, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996,  p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "In ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'' (1502-3), ''antilabe'' occurs as ''Orestes'' tries to induce ''Aegisthys'' to enter the house so that ''Orestes'' can kill him."&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, John E. Jr. ''The Facts on File Companion to Classical Drama''. Facts on File (Library of World Literature) 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; "[Antilabe is] used with particular freedom in late Euripides."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the plays of [[Aeschylus]], with the possible exception of ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (line 980), this phenomenon does not occur." &lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca drama==

"Dialogic exchanges using both ''[[stichomythia]]'' and ''antilabe'' are common in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. They occur in all the tragedies except ''Phoenissiae''."&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, A. J. ed. ''Seneca: Medea: Edited with Introduction, Translation, and Commentary''. Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Renaissance drama==

David Eggenberger notes that "[the device] was frequently utilized by [[Renaissance]] dramatists."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme example from Shakespeare is:

{{Quotation|Death?
::My lord?
::::A grave.
::::::He shall not live.|''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', 3.3}}

Some of the hypothesized [[stock character]]s included:
* '''Maccus''' ("The Fool", a hunchbacked, beak nosed character)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Bloom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22|quote=A grotesque statuette representing a beak-nosed, hunchbacked individual, was unearthed at Herculaneum in 1727, which by a slight stretch of imagination could be identified with Maccus|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punch and Judy: Its Origin and Evolution|last=Byrom|first=Michael|publisher=Shiva Publications|year=1972|isbn=0902982028|location=Aberdeen|pages=4|quote=There was the old man (Pappus), the old woman, the comic slave (Centunculus), the country booby (Buccus), the arrogant soldier (Manducus), the pompous doctor (Dossenus), and the sharp-tongued hooked nosed hunchback (Maccus).|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Buccus''' (the country booby)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Manducus''' (the arrogant soldier)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Pappus''' (the old man)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Centunculus''' (the comic slave) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Dosseunus''' (the pompous doctor) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
There has been some debate of these characters connection to similar stock characters in [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as [[Punch and Judy]]. Atellan Farce and Commedia were both improvised masked comedies. Some Historians argue that the stock characters in Atellan Farce are the beginnings of what would become the stock characters of Commedia dell'arte.

Some of the theorized character progressions are as follows:
* '''Pappus''' → [[Pantalone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Peirre|publisher=Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=17|quote=The ancestor of Pantaloon, and his son Harpagon, is Pappus, the lecherous old miser of the Antellane|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia dell'Arte|last=Oreglia|first=Giacomo|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York|pages=78|quote=In the ancient theatre the characters which recall this Mask are those of the various old men of Aristophanes, Plautus, Terence, and the Pappus of the Atella comedies|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Maccus+Buccu'''s → [[Pulcinella]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=The Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=The cradle of the family was the ancient city of Atella, in the Roman Campangna, and the gallery of ancestors shows, among others Bucco and the sensual Maccus, whose lean figure and cowardly nature reappear in Pulcinella|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=Dover Publication, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=29|quote=Pulcinella was always dressed in white like Maccus, the mimus albus, or white mime|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the connection of Atellan Farce to Commedia dell'arte and assumption that Atellan Farce is the precursor to Commedia dell'arte is still under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Blom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=21|quote=page 21 Not a little nonsense has been written about the “evolution” of the commedai dell’arte.

However, many historians still debate whether or not Punch's derivation can be traced back to Pulcinella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Blom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=23|quote=The identification of the statuette with a future in the Mimes or even with a stage character at all is very uncertain, nor is it safe to press its resemblance to the English Punch; there is no doubt that it looks like Punch but this, I think, is vest explained by the fame of the figure at the time of its discovery and by the influence of its peculiarities on the face and figure of the English villain-clown.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punch and Judy: Its Origin and Evolution|last=Byrom|first=Michael|publisher=Shiva Publications|year=1972|isbn=0902982028|location=Aberbeen|pages=5|quote=In 1662, Pulcinella crossed the English Channel and became 'Punchinello' later to be known simply as Punch.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
At first, the subjects were decided upon before the performance began and the dialogue was improvised as it proceeded. The performers were the sons of Roman citizens, who did not lose their rights as citizens, and were allowed to serve in the army: professional actors were excluded. The simple prose dialogues were probably varied by songs in the rude Saturnian metre: the language was that of the common people, accompanied by lively gesticulation and movements. They were characterized by coarseness and obscenity.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Atellanae Fabulae|volume=2|page=824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it is believed that the dictator [[Sulla]] wrote some Atellan Fables. [[Quintus Novius]], who flourished 50 years after the abdication of Sulla, wrote some fifty, including ''Macchus Sexul'' ("Exiled Macchus"), ''Gallinaria'' ("The Henhouse"), ''Surdus'' ("The Deaf One"), ''Vindemiatores'' ("The Harvesters"), and ''Parcus'' (“The Treasurer”).

[[Lucius Pomponius]], of [[Bologna]], is known to have composed a few, including ''Macchus Miles'' ("Macchus the Soldier"),  ''Pytho Gorgonius'', ''Pseudoagamemnon'', ''Bucco Adoptatus'', and ''Aeditumus''. He was also said to have been influenced by the Palliata [[Fabius Dorsennus]]. [[Quintus Novius]] and a "Memmius" were also authors of these comedies; [[Ovid]] and [[Pliny the Younger]] found the work of Memmius to be indecent.

==Controversy and suppression==
{{Citation needed|reason=I have not found any other source other than Wikipedia itself stating this information about the Atellan Farces becoming illegal |date=July 2018}}
Taken from [[Tacitus]] ( [[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]], Book 4): "...after various and often fruitless complaints from the praetors, the emperor [[Tiberius]] finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behavior of the players.  'They had often,' he said.  'Sought to disturb the public peace, and to bring disgrace on private families, and the old Oscan farce, once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, had become at once so indecent and popular, that it must be checked by the Senate's authority'.  The players, upon this, were banished from Italy".

[[Suetonius]] ('' [[The Twelve Caesars#Tiberius|Tiberius]]'', 45, 1) reports that Tiberius himself was mocked for his lecherous habits in an Atellan farce, after which the saying "the old goat lapping up the doe" (''hircum vetulum capreis naturam ligurire'') became popular.

The above passage suggests a growth in popularity or maybe even a revival of these farces, in the 20s AD, that met the disapproval of an older generation of patricians and senators.  Perhaps they were even performed out in public places as an act of direct hostility towards (or a means to mock) specific people or families.  At any rate, these performances eventually became so obnoxious that, in 28 AD, all those who performed in these farces were banished from Italy.

The ''[[Augustan History]]'' records that [[Hadrian]] furnished performances of Atellan Farces at banquets.&lt;ref&gt;''HA'' Hadrian 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quite a number of television shows have had episodes which were narrated in [[reverse chronology]], due possibly to narrative style, some sort of [[time travel]] mechanism, or a character (or society) who perceives time passing in the opposite direction. These are not simply episodes which allow a character to travel back in time, and relive the period forward; rather they are episodes where the period of time is either experienced or recounted from the chronological end to the chronological beginning. Those incorporating a time travel mechanism may or may not allow characters to break out of their [[destiny]]. Various backwards episodes include:

* "As Time Goes By" (''[[Sliders]]'')
* "[[Backwards (Red Dwarf episode)|Backwards]]" (''[[Red Dwarf]]'')
* "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]" (''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'')
* "[[The Betrayal]]" (''[[Seinfeld]]'')

'''Bathos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|θ|ɒ|s}} {{respell|BAY|thoss}};&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "bathos, ''n.''

In particular, bathos is associated with [[anticlimax (rhetoric)|anticlimax]], an abrupt transition from a lofty style or grand topic to a common or vulgar one. This may be either accidental (through artistic ineptitude) or intentional (for comic effect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=Robert Hartwell|title=Robert Hartwell Fiske's Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZqfZfIvtlsC&amp;pg=PA71|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4516-5134-8|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4130-3390-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional bathos appears in [[satire|satirical]] genres such as [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] and [[mock epic]]. "Bathos" or "bathetic" is also used for similar effects in other branches of [[the arts]], such as musical passages marked ''[[ridicolosamente]]''. In [[film]], bathos may appear in a [[contrast cut]] intended for [[comic relief]] or be produced by an accidental [[jump cut]].
__NOTOC__
== Definition ==
=== ''The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' ===
{{main|Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry}}
As the combination of the very high with the very low, the term was introduced by [[Alexander Pope]] in his essay ''[[Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry]]'' (1727).  On the one hand, Pope's work is a [[parody]] in prose of [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''Peri Hupsous'' (''[[On the Sublime]]''), in that he imitates Longinus's system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets, but, on the other, it is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the "dunces."

The nearest model for Pope's essay is the ''Treatise of the Sublime'' by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] of 1712.  Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's literary adversaries, [[Leonard Welsted]], had issued a "translation" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau.  Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this "sublime," Pope commented upon and countered their system with his ''Peri Bathos'' in the [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]-[[Alexander Pope|Pope]]-[[John Gay|Gay]]-[[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] ''Miscellanies.''  Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be "awe-inspiring," Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might "sink" in poetry, [[satire|satirizing]] the very men who were allied with [[Ambrose Philips]].  Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's ''Odes,'' and the rivalry broke down along political lines. According to Pope, bathos can be most readily applicable to love making after two years of marriage which is clearly in binary opposition to the sublime but is no less political. [[Edmund Burke]] was believed to be particularly charmed by Pope's articulation of love after marriage, inspiring Burke's essay [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]] (1756).

One example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting.  In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial [[genre]]s, [[still life]] ranked the lowest.  However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word "stiffen," evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this [[Hierarchy of genres|"low" genre]]:

:''Many Painters who could never hit a Nose or an Eye, have with Felicity copied a Small-Pox, or been admirable at a Toad or a Red-Herring. And seldom are we without Genius's for Still Life, which they can work up and stiffen with incredible Accuracy''. ("Peri Bathous" vi).

In chapters X and XI, Pope explains the comic use of the [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] and [[figures of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Kurtz |last=Wimsatt |authorlink=William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr. |year=1989 |origyear=1954 |title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC&amp;pg=PA176 176] |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-0111-8 |oclc=19554431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to "sink," the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things.  First, it violates "decorum," or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.

=== Subsequent evolution ===
Since Pope's day, the term "bathos," perhaps because of confusion with "[[pathos]]," has been used for art forms, and sometimes events, where something is so ''pathetic'' as to be humorous.

When artists consciously mix the very serious with the very trivial, the effect is of [[Surreal humour]] and [[absurd humor|the absurd]].  However, when an artist is unconscious of the juxtaposition (e.g., when a film maker means for [[Robot Monster|a man in a gorilla suit with a diving helmet]] to be frightening), the result is bathos.

Arguably, some forms of [[kitsch]] (notably the replication of serious or sublime subjects in a trivial context, like tea-towels with prints of [[Titian|Titian's]] ''Last Supper'' on them or hand guns that are actually cigarette lighters){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} express bathos in the concrete arts.

A tolerant but detached enjoyment of the aesthetic characteristics that are inherent in naive, unconscious and honest bathos is an element of the [[Camp (style)|camp sensibility]], as first analyzed by [[Susan Sontag]], in a 1964 essay [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Sontag-NotesOnCamp-1964.html "Notes on camp"].

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
Bathos as Pope described it may be found in a grandly rising thought that punctures itself: Pope offers one "Master of a Show in Smithfield, who wrote in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant:
:"This is the greatest Elephant in the World, except Himself."

Several decades before Pope coined the term, [[John Dryden]] had described one of the breath-taking and magically extravagant settings for his [[Restoration spectacular]], ''[[Albion and Albanius]]'' (1684–85):
:"The cave of [[Proteus]] rises out of the sea, it consists of several arches of rock work, adorned with mother of pearl, coral, and abundance of shells of various kinds. Through the arches is seen the sea, and parts of [[Dover|Dover pier]]."

Pope himself employed this type of figure intentionally for humor in his mock-heroic ''[[Rape of the Lock]],'' where a lady would be upset at the death of a lover "or lapdog."  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''The Sickness Unto Death,'' did the same thing, when he suggested that the "self" is easy to lose and that the loss of "an arm, a leg, a dog, or a wife" would be more grievous.  When intended, this is a form of satire or the literary figure of ''undercutting.''  When the context demands a lofty, serious, or grand interpretation, however, the effect is bathos.

[[Image:William Hogarth - The Bathos.png|thumb|right|Hogarth's ''The Bathos'']]

In 1764, [[William Hogarth]] published his last engraving, ''The Bathos, or the Manner of Sinking in Sublime Paintings inscribed to Dealers in Dark Pictures'', depicting [[Father Time]] lying exhausted in a scene of destruction, [[parody]]ing the fashion at that time for "[[wikt:sublime|sublime]]" works of art, and [[satire|satirising]] criticisms made of Hogarth's own works.  It may also be seen as a ''[[vanitas]]'' or ''[[memento mori]]'', foreshadowing Hogarth's death six months later.  Headed ''Tail Piece'', it was intended as the [[tailpiece]] for a bound edition of Hogarth's engravings.

== Examples ==

===Traditional===
[[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s [[narrative poem]] ''[[Enoch Arden]]'' ends with the following lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;So past the strong heroic soul away.
And when they buried him the little port
Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After stanzas of heightened poetic language, the poet, in three short lines, wraps up a [[pathos]]-laden story with mundane and practical details. The effect yanks the reader out of the poetic world, simultaneously offering commentary on the finality of death and the transience of heroics.

A musical representation is found in composer [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1923 [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet]] for wind instruments. The first two movements and the majority of the third movement follow traditional classical structures, albeit employing modern and innovative harmonies. The last fifteen seconds of the 25-minute work, however, abruptly and whimsically turn to popular harmony, rhythm, and style found in contemporary dance hall music.

=== Modern ===
{{quote|"Moviemakers talk about "bad laughs." That's when the audience laughs when it's not supposed to.

Contemporary examples often take the form of analogies, written to seem unintentionally funny:
* Week 310: It's Like This of [[The Style Invitational]] humor contest column in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' (14 March 1999), on humorous analogies, many exhibiting bathos, such as:

The [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]] features [[purple prose]], at times exhibiting bathos:
:They had but one last remaining night together, so they embraced each other as tightly as that two-flavor entwined string cheese that is orange and yellowish-white, the orange probably being a bland Cheddar and the white . . . Mozzarella, although it could possibly be Provolone or just plain American, as it really doesn't taste distinctly dissimilar from the orange, yet they would have you believe it does by coloring it differently.

Legendary [[darts]] commentator [[Sid Waddell]] was famed for his one-liners, including this example:
:“When Alexander of Macedonia was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds to conquer..... [[Eric Bristow|Bristow]] is only 27.”

'''Beer pong''', also known as '''Beirut''', is a [[drinking game]] in which players throw a [[ping pong]] ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of [[beer]] on the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two or more players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side.&lt;ref name="Shott"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shott |first=Chris |title=The Pong Arm of the Law |work=The Washington City Paper |date=October 7, 2005 |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/tell/2005/tell1007.html |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215656/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/tell/2005/tell1007.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team then takes turns attempting to shoot ping pong balls into the opponent's cups.

==Origin and name==
[[File:Throw Pong at Bucknell University.png|thumb|Members of [[Delta Upsilon]] playing Throw Pong at [[Bucknell University]] during the House Party weekend of 1980&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian"/&gt;]]
The game was originally believed to have evolved from the original [[Beer pong (paddles)|beer pong played with paddles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D12FB3455127B93C1AB178FD85F468785F9 | work=The New York Times | title=About Beer-Pong | date=1972-04-23 | accessdate=2010-04-26 | first=Ted | last=Lippman }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is generally regarded to have had its origins within the fraternities of [[Dartmouth College]] in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, where it has since become part of the social culture of the campus. The original version resembled an actual [[ping pong]] game with a net and one or more cups of beer on each side of the table. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2004/11/on-language-princeton-style-the-history-of-beirut|title=On language, Princeton style: The history of 'Beirut'|last=Berner|first=Laura|date=|year=2004|work=Daily Princetonian|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, a version without paddles was invented and the names ''Beer Pong'' and ''Beirut'' were adopted in some areas of the United States sometime in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/argus/archives/feb212003/dateyear/w5.html |title=l1 |publisher=Wesleyan.edu |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919095836/http://www.wesleyan.edu/argus/archives/feb212003/dateyear/w5.html |archivedate=2006-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/bc-reveres-8220-ancient-8221-tradition-of-beirut-1.925582 |title=" + artTitle.replace("-","") + " - " + "The Heights" + " - " + "Features" + " |publisher=Bcheights.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817094217/http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/bc-reveres-8220-ancient-8221-tradition-of-beirut-1.925582 |archivedate=2010-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bucknell University]]'s student-run newspaper, ''The Bucknellian'', claims [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity members at Bucknell created "Throw Pong", a game very similar to beer pong, during the 1970s,&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bucknell celebrates its part in the invention of Beer Pong|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B2ydPXnP9gA0NTRhMTVkMTctMjhlMS00YzZlLTgyYmEtMjU4Yzk1YjcxNjlk&amp;hl=en_US|accessdate=12 September 2011|newspaper=The Bucknellian|date=9 September 2011|author=Michelle Joline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bucknellian.net/10510/arts-campus-life/beer-pong-article/&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Throw Pong" was then brought to [[Lehigh University]] by fraternity brothers who visited Bucknell and this led to the creation of the version of beer pong that is played today.&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian" /&gt;

In some places, ''Beer Pong'' refers to the version of the game with paddles, and ''Beirut'' to the version without. However, according to a [[CollegeHumor]] survey, ''beer pong'' is the more common term than ''Beirut'' for the paddle-less game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/pongmap |title=Beer Pong vs. Beirut: What is the game called? |work=[[CollegeHumor]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-07-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070718001013/http://www.collegehumor.com/pongmap |archivedate = 2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the name "Beirut" is disputed. A 2004 op-ed article in the ''[[Daily Princetonian]],'' the student newspaper at [[Princeton University]], suggested that the name was possibly coined at Bucknell or Lehigh University around the time of the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. [[Beirut]], the capital of [[Lebanon]], was the scene of much fighting during the war, particularly [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire.&lt;ref name="DailyPrincetonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2004/11/on-language-princeton-style-the-history-of-beirut|title=On language, Princeton style: The history of 'Beirut'|last=Berner|first=Laura|date=|year=2004|work=Daily Princetonian|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setup==
[[File:Beerpong.png|thumb|A standard set up for a game of Beer Pong.]]

===Teams===
Beer pong is usually played with two teams of two to four players each. Each team begins the game by standing at either end of the table behind their rack of cups.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt;

===Playing field===
Although the game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors. In general, this will be a [[plywood]] board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Advice on building Beirut Tables |work=Terrapin Tables |url=http://www.terrapintables.com/tables.html |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022037/http://www.terrapintables.com/tables.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080430061301/http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&amp;story_id=34385 "Table of dreams"], April 18, 2008, ''The Daily Athenaeum''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim.com/sports/nfl/46277/ultimate-beer-pong-table.html "The ultimate beer pong table"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201010251/http://www.maxim.com/sports/nfl/46277/ultimate-beer-pong-table.html |date=2010-02-01 }}, ''Maxim'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies sell tables, including portable and inflatable tables.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSHxBUrzJqQ "America's Nightly Scoreboard"], [[Fox Business Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game can be played on any flat surface.

===Equipment===
The most common cups used are {{convert|18|USfloz|ml|adj=on }} [[disposable]] [[plastic cup]]s (such as red [[Solo Cup|Solo cups]]) with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. On each side of the table, teams assemble equilateral triangles with a convergence point focusing on the other team.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; Games typically use ten cups.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.
[[File:Red_Plastic_Cups.jpg|thumb|191x191px|Red plastic cups are sometimes associated with drinking games]]

===Alcohol===
An inexpensive [[pale lager]] or [[light beer]] of 3.2–5% [[alcohol by volume|ABV]] is sometimes preferred because of the large quantities consumed during the course of several games.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |last=Van Westen |first=Brandon |title=College Connoiseur Talks About Beer |work=The Collegian |location=[[South Dakota State University]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.sdsucollegian.com/2007/12/13/college-connoisseur-talks-about-beer-2/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202201232/http://www.sdsucollegian.com/2007/12/13/college-connoisseur-talks-about-beer-2/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes under house rules, there might be cups of other liquors used during the game. For non-drinkers, the game may be played without beer, as is done at [[Utah State University]], where alcohol is not allowed on campus; [[root beer]] is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kutv.com/content/news/topnews/story.aspx?content_id=d7521600-7f40-4602-91b2-c1bcac65c86f|title=Students At Utah State Play 'Drinking Game' With Root Beer Instead|publisher=''KUTV-TV''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113215146/http://www.kutv.com/content/news/topnews/story/Students-At-Utah-State-Play-Drinking-Game-With/ABZS10B_AkaRssG8rGXIbw.cspx|archivedate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sanitary reasons, the game may also be played with cups of water that players do not drink from, instead drinking from a separate cup of beer or alcohol.

==Game play==
[[File:beerpong reracks.png|thumb|upright|Possible beer pong re-racks]]

Traditionally, the game of beer pong has been played by countless variations of rule sets. In recent years, organizations such as The World Series of Beer Pong have put forth "official" rules. Typically, players abide by a uniform set of "house rules" which are often consistent within one university or region of the country (e.g. "West Coast rules") or may vary on a "house-by-house" basis.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080730002708/http://www.beerpong.com/beerpong_rules.htm Beer pong rules], Beerpong.com&lt;/ref&gt; Number of cups, bouncing, re-racking, amount of alcohol, distance shots must be taken from, etc. may all vary. All house rules should be posted or verbally stated and understood by both teams before the game starts.

The order of play varies - both players on one team can shoot, followed by both players on the other team, or players on opposite teams can alternate back and forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpong.com/beer-pong-rules#throwing_patterns|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525113235/http://www.bpong.com/beer-pong-rules#throwing_patterns|archivedate=2008-05-25 |title=Beer Pong Rules |publisher=Bpong.com |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cup that is made must immediately have its contents drunk and be removed from play. Some rule sets allow for "''re-racking''" (also known as "''reforming''", "''rearranging''", "''consolidation''", and other names), which is a rearrangement of a team's remaining cups after some have been removed. The formations, number of cups, when to rearrange and so on, depend on the rule set. For example, a team with three remaining cups may ask the other team to "re-rack" the cups into a single triangle formation.&lt;ref name="nbpl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbpl.net/rulesno.html |title=Rules without paddles |publisher= National Beer Pong League |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common house rules allow players to 'finger' or blow the ball out of the cup if the ball spins around the inner rim. Another common house rule states that if a team makes both shots during their turn, a 'rollback' occurs allowing each player to shoot again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpong.com/wsobp/official-rules-of-the-world-series-of-beer-pong#VD |title=World Series of Beer Pong rules |publisher=Bpong.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101223141420/http://www.bpong.com/wsobp/official-rules-of-the-world-series-of-beer-pong| archivedate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the World Series of Beer Pong rules, only a single-ball 'rollback' occurs resulting in a three cup maximum that can be made per turn.

Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups of water in order to wash off the balls. However, research has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name="The essence of beer pong bacteria"&gt;Clay Travis, [https://archive.is/20130119014923/http://www.cbssports.com/spin/story/9981066 "The essence of beer pong bacteria"] ''CBS Sportsline''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer pong bacteria"&gt;Nour Hammour, [http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2006/12/11/Life/Beer-Pong.Bacteria-2531832.shtml?norewrite200612261402&amp;sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com "Beer pong bacteria"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206042131/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2006/12/11/Life/Beer-Pong.Bacteria-2531832.shtml?norewrite200612261402&amp;sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com |date=2008-12-06 }}, ''[[GW Hatchet|The GW Hatchet]]''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, players may put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from.

===Shot techniques===
[[File:beerpong shots.png|300px|thumb|The typical path for the different kinds of shots]]

There are three common ways to shoot in beer pong: the arc, the fastball (or "laser, snipe, kamikaze"), and the bounce shot.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The most common throwing technique is the arc shot, where one grasps the ping pong ball with the tips of the thumb and forefinger, holds the arm at an angle with the ball upwards, then throws using a gentle elbow motion holding the upper arm parallel with the table.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt;

Some players throw "fastball" style which uses more of a hard chopping motion to send the ball in a more direct line toward the intended target cup.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt; A fastball shot may be favorable if house rules dictate that a cup knocked over is removed from the table, in which case a fastball can eliminate multiple cups if thrown hard enough.

A bounce shot is performed by bouncing the ball towards the cups. Depending on house rules, if the other team has the opportunity to swat away a bounced ball, a bounce shot may be worth more than one cup.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt;

===Winning the game===
If a team makes their last cup, the other team loses unless they can make all of their remaining cups; this is called a rebuttal or redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, Matt [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023217/http://media.www.uwmleader.com/media/storage/paper980/news/2006/01/25/Sports/Road-To.Glory-1987477.shtml "Road to Glory"], '''UWM Leader''', Jan. 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; If the losing team can hit their redemption shots, then the game is forced into overtime where three cups are used instead of the normal ten cups.

Another 'house rule' can be stated before or during the game in the midst of a [[shutout]]. A shutout in beer pong occurs if one team makes all ten of their cups and the opposite team makes none of their cups. If the shutout does occur, the losing team must do whatever the two teams decided on, such as going [[streaking]] (naked lap) or drinking a large quantity of beer.

Also depending on 'house rules', there are other ways to end the game. Cups that were accidentally left in the rack after being made are known as death/kill cups. These cups will immediately end the game if made again.

==Health effects==
The game may have several associated health risks. As with any activity involving alcohol, beer pong may cause players to become [[Alcohol intoxication|drunken]] or even intoxicated enough to suffer [[alcohol poisoning]]. Also, the supposed cleaning effects of the water "dunk" cup may be offset by bacteria in the cups.&lt;ref name="The essence of beer pong bacteria" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer pong bacteria" /&gt;

Some writers have mentioned beer pong as contributing to "out of control" college drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Granwehr |first=Meredith Austin |title=College Drinking: Out of Control |work=[[Hartford Courant]] |date=December 1, 2007 |url=http://articles.courant.com/2004-10-10/news/0410100754_1_party-school-emergency-room-bigger-hospital |accessdate=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Bob (January 8, 2008).

Some municipalities and states have attempted to ban beer pong, either from bars or in general, due to the belief that it encourages [[binge drinking]] (see Health Effects above). In [[Oxford, Ohio]], where [[Miami University]] is located, the city council tried to ban the game from being played outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Strader |first=Sean |title=Council vote freezes beer pong ban |work=The Oxford Press |url=http://www.oxfordpress.com/hp/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/02/22/op022307drinking.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218070505/http://www.oxfordpress.com/hp/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/02/22/op022307drinking.html |archivedate=2009-02-18 |date=February 23, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arlington, Virginia]]&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; and [[Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090602123140/http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2009/05/30/several_campus_bars_punished_for "Several campus bars punished for infractions"], ''The News-Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt; bar owners were told to stop allowing the game to be played in their establishments.

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] ran an article on July 31, 2008 called "The War Against Beer Pong", noting legal restrictions and bans on the game in college and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="WarAgainstBeerPong"&gt;Haire, Meaghan.

In many states, players have taken to placing water in cups in order to hold organized beer pong tournaments legally in bars. Some examples of this can be found in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Tournaments and leagues==
Beer pong tournaments are held in the United States at the local, regional, and national levels.

The [[World Series of Beer Pong]] (WSOBP) is the largest beer pong tournament in the world. WSOBP IV, held in January 2009 at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], had a $50,000 grand prize and over 800 participants from the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Hennessey |first= Kathleen |title=Vegas beer pong competition gets (almost) serious | work = USATODAY.COM | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2009-01-05-beerpong_N.htm | date=January 5, 2009 | accessdate=2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WSOBP V, held in January 2010, had over 1,000 participants including teams from Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Japan. The World Beer Pong Tour has stops in various cities and cash prizes as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/shore/blogs/updates/index.ssf/2009/06/beer_pong_for_money_not_just_g.html "Beer pong for money, not just getting drunk"], June 10, 2009, ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more common organization of beer pong games are leagues which operate on a local or regional level.

This documentary, directed by Dan Lindsay, premiered at the [[CineVegas]] film festival on June 13, 2008. [[Rick Reilly]] wrote an entire column about The World Series of Beer Pong IV for ''ESPN The Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3831916 |title=Beer Pong: The next great american pastime |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202230908/http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3831916| archivedate= 2 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] cited the game and other drinking games as a factor in deaths of college students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080711133153/http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/07/07/drinking.game.deaths.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview " Drinking games pose serious threat"], ''Associated Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine recently had an article on the popularity of beer pong&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; and posted a video on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/video/?bcpid=1214055407&amp;bctid=1717896427 VIDEO], ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; In both, players claimed beer pong was a sport, rather than a game—similar to [[billiards]] and [[darts]].

The game has been a recurring segment on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', with host Fallon playing against female celebrity guests such as [[Betty White]], [[Serena Williams]], [[Anna Kournikova]], [[Charlize Theron]] and [[Jessica Alba]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130129051458/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/06/12/betty-white-takes-on-jimmy-fallons-beer-pong-challenge/ "Betty White Takes on Fallon's Beer Pong Challenge"], MTV News&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Colbert Report]]'' featured a segment on the CDC study hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/220488/march-03-2009/beer-pong-herpes-outbreak |title=Herpes through Beer Pong |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=2009-03-03 |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/fox_friends_spreads_herpesbeer.php "Fox &amp; Friends Spreads Herpes-Beer Pong Hoax"], ''Columbia Journalism Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Road Trip: Beer Pong]]'', a sequel to the 2000 comedy ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', featured the game prominently. [[Agnes Scott College]], where most of the movie was filmed, did not want to be listed in the credits after complaints from students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105167198 "Lowbrow Comedy Meets Higher Education"], ''National Public Radio''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishing===
On August 29, 2009, [[Chronicle Books]] published ''The Book of Beer Pong'', a 200-page fully illustrated guide to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Beer Pong |publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] |isbn=978-0-8118-6632-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bud pong===
Bud pong was the branded version of beer pong that brewer [[Anheuser-Busch]] said involved the drinking of water, not [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] or any other beer. In the summer of 2005, the company began marketing "bud pong" kits to its distributors. Francine I. Katz, vice president for communications and consumer affairs, was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as saying that bud pong was not intended for underage drinkers because promotions were held in bars, not on campuses. And it did not promote binge drinking, she said, because official rules call for water to be used, not beer.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Gettleman |first=Jeffrey |title=As Young Adults Drink to Win, Marketers Join In |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 16, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064233/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html |archivedate=February 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' quoted a bartender at a club near [[Clemson University]] as saying she had worked at several bud pong events and had "never seen anyone playing with water. It's always beer. It's just like any other beer pong."&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Some expressed incredulity at Anheuser-Busch's public statements. Henry Wechsler, director of the College Alcohol Study at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], said: "Why would alcohol companies promote games that involve drinking water? It's preposterous,"&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; while advertising news site Adjab opined that "someone playing bud pong with water is about as likely as a teenage kid using the [[rolling paper]] he bought at the convenience store to smoke tobacco."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finley |first=Adam |title=Beer Pong promotions not so good |work=Ad-Jab |date=October 18, 2005 |url=http://www.adjab.com/2005/10/18/beer-pong-promotions-not-so-good/ |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814001648/http://www.adjab.com/2005/10/18/beer-pong-promotions-not-so-good/ |archivedate=14 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to the cost saving effects. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or a sip from their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This is usually done when there isn't enough beer to accommodate a large number of games during the party.

===Video games===
[[File:Beer_Pong_Machine.jpg|thumb|219x219px|A beer pong arcade machine.]]
In July 2008, [[JV Games]] Inc. released a downloadable video game for the [[Wii]] console called ''Frat Party Games: Beer Pong''. After much outrage by parent and university groups, the game was renamed ''[[Frat Party Games: Pong Toss]]'' and all references to alcohol were removed.&lt;ref name="WarAgainstBeerPong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,377421,00.html |title='Beer Pong' Video Game Has Controversy Brewing |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boria''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: '''بوريا''') is a form of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[theatre]] of [[India]]n origin which has through adaptive processes, become the one and only theatre of Malay community in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref name="reference 1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Boria: a form of Malay theatre (Local history and memoirs)|pages=xii,1 &amp; 2|author=Rahmah Bujang|isbn=978-9971-988-58-6|year= 1987|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Records on the origin of Boria are fairly limited but it was first mentioned by H.T. Haughton in 1897 which according to him, it was first brought to Penang in 1845 by the [[Muslim]] soldiers of 21st [[Madras Regiment]]. It was originally played to celebrate the annual [[Shiite]] festival, the [[Mourning of Muharram]]. In 1910, R.J Wilkinson, a Straits Civil Service officer and a noted scholar of Malay studies, made a comparison between the boria of [[Madras]] and [[Penang]], and established that the resemblance was only in name, for the show as then known in Penang had evolved to a totally different form.&lt;ref name="reference 1" /&gt;

==The performance==
A typical Boria troupe consists of a leader, a chorus, comedians and musicians. The performance normally begins with a short comic sketches and followed by a song-dance routine featuring a juxtaposition of choral and solo parts. The song-dance routine commonly performed in a western music style and with dance forms such as [[rhumba|rumba]]s, [[cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]] or soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancemalaysia.com/Dance/Traditional/Folk_Dance/Boria/boria.htm|title=Boria|publisher=Dance Malaysia|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmall-asia.com/malaysia/folk/boria.html |title=Music for Theater: Boria |publisher=Musicmall Production Pte Ltd |year=2004 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514005605/https://www.musicmall-asia.com/malaysia/folk/boria.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boria’s theme varies from Arab warriors, European traders to Chinese shopkeepers around which the costumes and comic improvisations revolved. The main melodic instruments has consistently [[violin]] but various Western, Malay, or Indian drums and Chinese cymbals are also used in the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music|page=236 &amp; 237|author=Terry Miller &amp;  Sean Williams|isbn=978-0-415-96075-5|year= 2008|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Bourgeois tragedy''' (German: ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'') is a form of [[tragedy]] that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the [[the Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeois|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.

==In England and France==
There are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see [[domestic tragedy]]), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: [[George Lillo]]'s ''[[The London Merchant]]; or, [[the History of George Barnwell]]'', which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first ''tragédie bourgeoise'' was ''Sylvie'' by [[Paul Landois]], which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by [[Denis Diderot]]: ''Le fils naturel'' was first staged in 1757 and ''Le père de famille'' in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.

==Heroes in classical tragedy==
While ordinary people had always been the subject of [[comedy|comedies]], classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. [[Aristotle]] articulates this idea in ''ars poetica'' (''The Poetics'') and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German [[Martin Opitz]], perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as [[Andreas Gryphius]]' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King [[Charles I of England]]), [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]] (the wife of [[Theseus]], a mythical king of [[Athens]]) or [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]], serve as tragic protagonists.

==In Germany==
In Germany, where the new genre was called ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'', it was especially successful.  Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany. However, [[Christian Leberecht Martini]]'s drama ''Rhynsolt und Sapphira'' is slightly older. Lessing's ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie''. Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are ''Die Soldaten'' by [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] (1776) and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Kabale und Liebe]]'' (1784). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/503446347|title=Exemplarity and mediocrity : the art of the average from bourgeois tragedy to realism|last=1968-|first=Fleming, Paul,|date=2009|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804769983|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=503446347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Bourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10678">[[File:Buttered cat.png|thumb|A cartoon illustration of the [[thought experiment]]]]

The '''buttered cat paradox''' is a common joke based on the [[tongue-in-cheek]] combination of two [[adage]]s:

* [[Cat righting reflex|Cats always land on their feet]].
* Buttered toast always lands [[Buttered toast phenomenon|buttered side down]].

The [[paradox]] arises when one considers what would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast (butter side up) to the back of a cat, then dropped the cat from a large height. The buttered cat paradox, submitted by artist [[John Frazee]] of [[Kingston, New York]], won a 1993 ''[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]]'' magazine competition about paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Scot |date=July 1993 |title=I have a theory... |magazine=Omni |url=http://www.housevampyr.com/training/library/books/omni/OMNI_1993_07.pdf |page=96 |volume=15 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verley |first=Jason C. |date=November 2001 |title=Letters: More on Alternate Theories |magazine=APS News |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200111/letters.cfm |volume=10 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise, stating the conditions of the cat and bread and posed as a question, was presented in a routine by comic and juggler [[Michael Davis (juggler)|Michael Davis]], appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', July 22, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq0YjR11bx8 ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', July 22, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought experiments ==
Some people jokingly maintain that the experiment will produce an [[anti-gravity]] effect.  They propose that as the cat falls towards the ground, it will slow down and start to rotate, eventually reaching a [[steady state]] of hovering a short distance from the ground while rotating at high speed as both the buttered side of the toast and the cat’s feet attempt to land on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/fmd/newsletter/Newsletter_No14.pdf |title=UoWaikato newsletter |format=PDF |date=August 2003 |publisher=University of Waikato |accessdate=2012-06-20 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faux paradox has captured the imagination of science-oriented [[humorist]]s.  In May 1992, the [[Internet Oracle|Usenet Oracle]] Digest #441 included a question from a supplicant asking about the paradox.&lt;ref name=oracle&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Internet Oracle|Usenet Oracle]] |url=http://internetoracle.org/digest.cgi?N=441#441-07 |title=Usenet Oracularities #441 |date=1992-05-04 |editor-first1=Steve |editor-last=Kinzler |editor-link=Steve Kinzler |author=Usenet Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testing the theory is the main theme in an episode of the [[comic book]] strip ''[[Jack B. Quick]]'', the title character seeks to test this theory, leading to the cat hovering above the ground, with the cat's wagging tail providing propulsion.  The March 31, 2005, strip of the [[webcomic]] ''[[Bunny (webcomic)|Bunny]]'' also explored the idea in the guise of a plan for a "Perpetual Motion MoggieToast 5k Power Generator", based on [[Sod's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunny-comic.com/211.html |title=Feline cunning and sods law |work=[[Bunny (webcomic)]] |first=Huw "Lem" |last=Davies |number=211 |date=2005-03-31 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Science Askew'', Donald E. Simanek comments on this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="SimanekHolden2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simanek |first1=Donald E. |last2=Holden |first2=John C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Science Askew: A Light-hearted Look at the Scientific World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldX0FkgurzoC&amp;pg=PA201 |accessdate=2010-06-30 |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-7503-0714-7 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea appeared on the British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', where the idea was discussed. As well as talking about the idea, they also brought up other questions regarding the paradox. These included:
*"Would it still work if you used [[margarine]]?",
*"Would it still work if you used [[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter]]?", and
*"What if the toast was covered in something that was not butter, but the cat thought it was butter?" (the idea being that it would act like a [[placebo]]).&lt;ref name="QI"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hypothetical |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/8/8/ |series=QI |serieslink=QI |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |location=London |airdate=2010-11-05 |seriesno=H |number=8 |first1=Sandi |last1=Toksvig |first2=Johnny |last2=Vegas |first3=John |last3=Lloyd |last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also appeared in a comics series called ''[[Kid Paddle]]'' where Kid tells the story to his gullible friend Horace while at the dinner table. The comic is fairly popular in France and Belgium.

== In reality ==
In reality, cats possess the ability to turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down, known as the [[cat righting reflex]]. This enables them to land on their feet if dropped from sufficient height, about {{Convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |title=How does a Cat always land on its feet? |first=Huy D. |last=Nguyen |date=1998 |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Medical Engineering |accessdate=2014-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010410235503/http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |archivedate=2001-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toast, being an inanimate object, lacks both the ability and the desire to right itself. A study at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] involving dropping 100 slices under laboratory conditions established that toast typically lands on the floor butter-side-down as a result of the manner in which it is typically dropped from a table, and the aerodynamic drag caused by the air pockets within the bread. The toast is typically butter-side-up when dropped. As it falls, it rotates; given the typical speed of rotation and the typical height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor in 81% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/-rav--r-manchester-boffins-5842879 |title=(-Rav)/ t = R: Manchester boffins find formula for why toast lands butter side down |first=Chris |last=Slater|newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2017-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eating Comp 21aug2005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sonya Thomas]] and [[Tim Janus]] at the 2005 Midway Slots [[Crabcake]] Eating Competition.]]

'''Competitive eating''', or '''speed eating''', is an activity in which participants compete against each other to consume large quantities of food, usually in a short time period. Contests are typically eight to ten minutes long, although some competitions can last up to thirty minutes, with the person consuming the most food being declared the winner. Competitive eating is most popular in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]], where organized professional eating contests often offer prizes, including cash.

==History==
[[File:Pie eating contest 1923.jpg|thumb|Pie-eating contest at the Jefferson School in Washington, DC, August 2, 1923.]]
Traditionally, eating contests, often involving pies, were events at [[county fair]]s. The recent surge in the popularity of competitive eating is due in large part to the development of the [[Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest]], an annual holiday tradition that has been held on July 4 virtually every year since the 1970s at [[Coney Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathansfamous.com/index.php/hot-dog-eating-contest |title=Hot Dog Eating Contest |publisher=Nathansfamous.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Takeru Kobayashi]] ate 50 hot dogs – smashing the previous record (25.5). The event generates enormous media attention and has been aired on ESPN for the past eight years, contributing to the growth of the competitive eating phenomenon. Takeru Kobayashi won it consistently from 2001 through 2006.  He was dethroned in 2007 by [[Joey Chestnut]]. In 2008, Chestnut and Kobayashi tied at 59 hot dogs in 10 minutes (the time span had previously been 12 minutes), and Chestnut won in an eat off in which he was the first of the two competitors to finish eating 5 hot dogs in overtime, earning Chestnut his second consecutive title.  Chestnut still holds the world record of 69 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes for the 2013 competition.  Kobayashi holds six Guinness Records, for eating hot dogs, meatballs, Twinkies, hamburgers, and pizza. He competed in hot dog contests in 2011 and 2012 and claimed to have eaten 68 and 69. 
The current champion is Joey Chestnut, with a total of 74 hot dogs and buns eaten on July 4, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/07/04/joey-chestnut-wins-nathans-hot-dog-eating-contest-4th-july/757748002/|title=Joey Chestnut breaks world record, downs 74 hot dogs to win Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest|last=|first=|date=4 July 2018|website=|publisher=|via=USA Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

===All Pro Eating===
All Pro Eating Competitive Eaters include [[Molly Schuyler]], Eric "Silo" Dahl, Jamie "The Bear" McDonald and Stephanie "Xanadu" Torres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competitiveeaters.com/rankings.html|title=All Pro Eating Promotions|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IFOCE===
The [[International Federation of Competitive Eating]] (IFOCE) hosts nearly 50 "Major League Eating" events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoce.com/about.php |title=Major League Eating &amp; International Federation of Competitive Eating |publisher=Ifoce.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; across North America every year.

===Other challenges===
Other eating contests sponsored by restaurants can involve a challenge to eat large or extraordinarily spicy food items, including giant [[steak]]s, [[hamburger]]s and [[curries]] in a set amount of time. Those who finish the item are often rewarded by not having to pay for the item, or with a T-shirt and the addition of their name and/or photo on a wall of challenge victors. For example, Ward's House of Prime located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has a prime rib meat challenge. The current record is 360 ounces by Molly Schuyler in June 2017. Various challenges of this type are featured in the [[Travel Channel]] show ''[[Man v. Food]]''.

The Great American Eat Off - a show that pits two average eaters against each other to see who can eat the fastest, while raising awareness for charity and then brings in a professional competitive eater to beat the winning time, raises the stakes for competitive eaters by incorporating various challenges and obstacles that would interfere with their speed. Obstacles may include eating with two spoons, eating with no hands, or [[Interval Eating]] where the competitive eat is permitted to eat for a limited time and then must rest for a specific time (i.e., eat 20 seconds, rest 40 seconds, eat 20 seconds, rest 40 seconds etc.) until they have completed the designated food. Interval Eating was created by [[Gail Kasper]].

==Contest structure==

===Food===
The type of food used in contests varies greatly, with each contest typically only using one type of food (e.g. a hot dog eating contest). Foods used in professional eating contests include [[hamburger]]s, [[hot dog]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/competitive-eating-how-safe-is-it |title=Competitive Eating: How Safe Is It? |publisher=Webmd.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pie]]s, [[pancake]]s, [[Buffalo wing|chicken wings]], [[asparagus]], [[pizza]], [[ribs (food)|ribs]], whole [[Domesticated turkey#Turkeys as food|turkey]]s, among many other types of food. There is also a [[Veganism|vegan]] hot dog eating competition held in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="Scenes from a vegan hot dog eating contest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scenes from a Vegan hot dog eating contest|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/11/15/scenes-from-a-vegan-hot-dog-ea.html|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules and overview of events===
Competitive eating contests often adhere to an 8, 10, 12, or 15 minute time limit. Most contests are presided over by a [[master of ceremonies]], whose job is to announce the competitors prior to the contest and keep the audience engaged throughout the contest with enthusiastic play-by-play commentary and amusing anecdotes. A countdown from 10 usually takes place at the end of the contest, with all eating coming to an end with the expiration of time.

Many professional contests also employ a series of [[judge]]s, whose role is to enforce the contest rules and warn eaters about infractions. Judges will also be called upon to count or weigh each competitor's food and certify the results of the contest prior to the winner being announced.

====Chipmunking====
Many eaters will attempt to put as much food in their mouths as possible during the final seconds of a contest, a practice known by professionals as "chipmunking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A241452 Force Fed] ''Creative Loafing blog'' May 9, 2007. Retrieved on June 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; If chipmunking is allowed in a contest, eaters are given a reasonable amount of time (typically less than two minutes) to swallow the food or risk a deduction from their final totals.

====Dunking====
In many contests, except those adhering to "picnic style rules" mentioned previously, eaters are allowed to dunk foods in water or other liquids in order to soften the food and make it easier to chew and swallow. Dunking typically takes place with foods involving a bun or other doughy parts. Professional contests often enforce a limit on the number of times competitors are allowed to dunk food.

====Debris====
Competitors are required to maintain a relatively clean eating surface throughout the contest. Excess debris after the contest results in a deduction from the eater's final totals.

====Vomiting====
If, at any point during or immediately after the contest, a competitor [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitates]] any food, he or she will be disqualified. Vomiting, also known as a "reversal", or, as ESPN and the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest call it, a "reversal of fortune", includes obvious signs of vomiting as well as any small amounts of food that may fall from the mouth deemed by judges to have come from the stomach. Small amounts of food already in the mouth prior to swallowing are excluded from this rule.

==Training and preparation==
Many professional competitive eaters undergo rigorous personal training in order to increase their stomach capacity and eating speed with various foods. Stomach elasticity is usually considered the key to eating success, and competitors commonly train by drinking large amounts of water over a short time to stretch out the stomach. Others combine the consumption of water with large quantities of low calorie foods such as vegetables or salads. Some eaters chew large amounts of gum in order to build jaw strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/foodwine/2002527620_eating29m.html Eating champs to chow down at Everett wingding by Brian Alexander]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a marquee event like the [[Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest]], some eaters, like current contest champion [[Joey Chestnut]], will begin training several months before the event with personal time trials using the contest food.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andy. "[http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2008/07/champion_competitive_eater_sha.html Champion competitive eater shares his training, victory]" ''[[The Oregonian]] online.'' July 15, 2008. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Retired competitive eater Ed "Cookie" Jarvis trained by consuming entire heads of boiled cabbage followed by drinking up to two gallons of water every day for two weeks before a contest.&lt;ref&gt;Gullapalli, Diya. "You Have to Be in Good Shape To Eat 4.21 Hot Dogs a Minute" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]].'' August 
15, 2002. Retrieved on June 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the risks involved with training alone or without emergency medical supervision, the IFOCE actively discourages training of any sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoce.com/safety.php |title=Major League Eating &amp; International Federation of Competitive Eating |publisher=Ifoce.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Televised contests==
* The annual [[Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest]], which has been held every [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] since the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/nyregion/19experience.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Roberts | title=Mortimer Matz, Press Agent Extraordinaire | date=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is televised live on [[ESPN]] from [[Coney Island]] in the [[Brooklyn]] [[New York City borough|borough]] of [[New York City]].
* The annual [[Krystal Square Off]] [[hamburger]] eating contest has been televised on ESPN and, in 2008, on the Root Sports South network.

* [[Spike TV]] (now the Paramount Network) broadcast several IFOCE-sanctioned competitive eating competitions as part of its "MLE Chowdown" series.

==Criticisms and dangers==

===Criticisms===
The chief criticism of competitive eating is the message the [[gluttony|gluttonous]] sport sends as [[obesity]] levels rise among Americans&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21915036/ Some find competitive eating hard to swallow]." ''[[MSNBC.com]].'' November 21, 2007. Retrieved on July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the example it sets for youth.&lt;ref name="foxbusiness.com"&gt;Vasel, Kathryn. "[http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/personal-finance/on-topic/sports/competitive-eating-contests-bring-dough/ Competitive Eating Contests Bring in the Dough]." ''[[FoxBusiness.com]].'' January 31, 2008. Retrieved on July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, like actor [[Ryan Reynolds]] in an editorial on ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', contend that competitive eating is yet another example of Western gluttony at a time when so many others around the world are starving.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Ryan. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-reynolds/competitive-eating_b_50682.html Competitive Eating]." ''[[Huffingtonpost.com]].'' June 6, 2007. Retrieved on July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, retired competitive eater Don "Moses" Lerman foreshadows the dangers of competitive eating when he admits "I'll stretch my stomach until it causes [[internal bleeding]]."

===Dangers===
The argument that competitive eating can cause weight gain,&lt;ref&gt;Burbach, Cherie. "[http://www.blisstree.com/tag/obesity-and-speed-eaters/ Health Risks of Speed Eating]." ''Blisstree.com.'' July 3, 2009. Retrieved on July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which may lead to [[obesity]] and elevated [[cholesterol]] and [[blood pressure]], is common. The potential damage that competitive eating can cause to the human digestive system was the subject of a 2007 study by the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]. The study observed professional eater [[Tim Janus]], who ate 36 hot dogs in 10 minutes before doctors intervened. It was concluded that through training, Janus' stomach failed to have normal muscle contractions called [[peristalsis]], a function which transfers food from the stomach down the digestive tract.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Madison. "[http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/07/03/competitive.eating.stomach/index.html Speed eaters gain weight, clog arteries but have few regrets]." ''CNNHealth.com.'' July 3, 2009. Retrieved on July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other medical professionals contend that [[binge eating]] can cause stomach perforations in those with [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]] and gulping large quantities of water during training can lead to [[water intoxication]], a condition which dilutes [[electrolytes]] in the [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;Sine, Richard. "[http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/competitive-eating-how-safe-is-it?page=2 Competitive Eating: How Safe Is It?]." ''[[WebMD]].'' Retrieved on July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gastroparesis]], also known as stomach paralysis, is also a concern among those who routinely stretch their stomachs beyond capacity. The condition may lead to the stomach's inability to contract and lose its ability to empty itself. Side effects of gastroparesis include chronic [[indigestion]], nausea and vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;Sine, Richard. "[http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/competitive-eating-how-safe-is-it?page=3 Competitive Eating: How Safe Is It?]." ''[[WebMD]].'' Retrieved on July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, a 32-year-old man died while competitively eating live [[Cockroach|roaches]] and [[worm]]s in a contest to win a [[ball python]]. An autopsy revealed he choked to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Man-Choked-to-Death-During-Roach-Eating-Contest-Autopsy-180870531.html |title=Man Choked to Death After Roach-Eating Contest: Autopsy &amp;#124; NBC 6 South Florida |publisher=Nbcmiami.com |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 4, 2014, a 47-year-old competitive eater similarly choked to death during a hot dog eating contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/07/08/us/ap-us-eating-contest-death.html?ref=aponline |title=Man Man Dies at South Dakota Hot Dog Eating Contest|date=2014-07-07 |accessdate=2014-07-07|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[Sacred Heart University]] event on April 2, 2017, a 20-year-old female student died as a result of a pancake-eating contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/04/03/university-mourns-sorority-sister-who-died-after-pancake-eating-contest/?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_pancakecontest-720pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory | title=University Mourns Sorority Sister Who Died As A Result Of A Pancake-eating Contest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">In [[English drama]], a '''domestic tragedy''' is a [[tragedy]] in which the tragic protagonists are ordinary middle-class or lower-class individuals. This subgenre contrasts with [[classical antiquity|classical]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[tragedy]], in which the protagonists are of kingly or [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter. 

The [[Ancient Greek]] theorist [[Aristotle]] had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world. 

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], the first domestic tragedies were written in the [[English Renaissance]]; one of the first was ''[[Arden of Faversham]]'' (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his adulterous wife. Other famous examples are ''[[A Woman Killed with Kindness]]'' (1607), ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' (1608), and ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' (1621).&lt;ref name="SturgessHeywood2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Sturgess|author2=Thomas Heywood|title=Three Elizabethan Domestic Tragedies: Arden of Faversham; a Yorkshire Tragedy; a Woman Killed with Kindness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kJ-JxlddCsC|date=23 February 2012|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-241-96146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Othello]]'' can be classified as a domestic tragedy.&lt;ref name="Benson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Benson|title=Shakespeare, 'Othello' and Domestic Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgug588s3jgC&amp;pg=PT10|date=15 December 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3766-1|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic tragedy disappeared during the era of [[Restoration drama]], when Neoclassicism dominated the stage, but it emerged again with the work of [[George Lillo]] and Sir [[Richard Steele]] in the [[Augustan drama|eighteenth century]].

'''Dramaturgy''' is the study of [[drama]]tic composition and the [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of the main elements of drama on the stage.

The term first appears in the eponymous work  ''[[Hamburg Dramaturgy]]'' (1767–69) by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. Lessing composed this collection of essays on the principles of drama while working as the world's first dramaturge at the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]. Dramaturgy is distinct from play writing and directing, although the three may be practiced by one individual.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[dramatist]]s combine writing and dramaturgy when creating a drama. Others work with a specialist, called a [[dramaturge]], to adapt a work for the stage.

Dramaturgy may also be broadly defined as "adapting a story to actable form." Dramaturgy gives a performance work foundation and [[Dramatic structure|structure]]. Often the dramaturge's strategy is to manipulate a narrative to reflect the current [[Zeitgeist]] through cross-cultural signs, theater and film historical references to genre, ideology, role of gender representation etc. in the dramatization.

== Definition and history ==
Dramaturgy is a practice-based as well as practice-led discipline invented by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (the author of well known plays such as ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'', ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]'', and ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'') in the 18th century. The Theater of Hamburg engaged him for some years for a position today known as "dramaturge". He was first of this kind and described his task as ‘"dramatic judge" ("dramatischer Richter") who has to be able to tell the difference between the stake the play has or the main actor or the director to make us feel comfortable or not while watching a theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. &amp; BERGHAHN, K. L. 1981. Hamburgische Dramaturgie, Stuttgart, Reclam.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1767–1770 Lessing wrote and published as result a series of criticisms titled ''Hamburg Dramaturgy (Hamburgische Dramaturgie).'' These works analyzed, criticized and theorized the German theatre, and made Lessing the father of modern dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171026/dramaturgy?anchor=ref666078 Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Lessing's ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie'' (Lessing and Berghahn, 1981) and ''Laokoon'' &lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. 1766. Laokoon, Berlin, C. F. Vosst&lt;/ref&gt; and Hegel’s "Aesthetics" (written 1835–1838),&lt;ref&gt;HEGEL, G. W. F. &amp; KNOX, T. M. 1975. Aesthetics : lectures on fine art, Oxford, Clarendon Presst&lt;/ref&gt; many authors, including  Hölderlin, Goethe, Schelling, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams, started to reflect on theater, not only in Germany.,&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 18. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschelverlag Berlin; 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 19. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschel Verlag; 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustav Freytag summed up those reflections in his book ''The Technique of the Drama'',&lt;ref&gt;FREYTAG, G. Technique of the drama: an exposition of dramatic composition and art; an authorized translation from the 6th German ed. by Elias J. MacEwan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been translated into English and published in the late 19th century in the USA. Freytag's book is seen as the blueprint for the  first Hollywood screenwriting manuals. ''The Technique of Play Writing'' by Charlton Andrews, 1915,&lt;ref&gt;ANDREWS, C. 1915. The Technique of Play Writing, Springfield, Mass. : The Home correspondence schoolt&lt;/ref&gt; refers to European and German traditions of dramaturgy and understanding dramatic composition.

Another important work in the Western theatrical tradition is ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by [[Aristotle]] (written around 335 BC). In this work Aristotle analyzes [[tragedy]]. Aristotle considers ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BC) as the quintessential dramatic work. He analyzes the relations among [[Character (arts)|character]], action, and speech, gives examples of good plots, and examines the reactions the plays provoke in the audience. Many of his "rules" are referred to today as "Aristotelian drama". In ''Poetics'', Aristotle discusses many key concepts of drama, such as [[anagnorisis]] and [[catharsis]].

''Poetics'' is the earliest surviving [[Western civilization|Western]] work of [[dramatic theory]]. The earliest non-Western dramaturgic work is probably the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] work ''Natya Shastra'' (''The Art of Theatre''), written around [[Anno Dommini|500 BCE to 500 CE]], which describes the elements, forms and narrative elements of the ten major types of ancient Indian dramas.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. ''Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director''. University of Melbourne: Melbourne. p37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

Dramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides. The dramaturge is the resident expert on the physical, social, political, and economic milieus in which the action takes place, the psychological underpinnings of the characters, the various metaphorical expressions in the play of thematic concerns; as well as on the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing: structure, rhythm, flow, even individual word choices.&lt;ref&gt;Terry McCabe. ''Mis-Directing the Play: An Argument Against Contemporary Theatre''. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional dramaturges may participate in many phases of play production including casting of the play, offering in-house criticism of productions-in-progress, and informing the director, the cast, and the audience about a play’s history and its current importance. In America, this type of dramaturgy is sometimes known as Production Dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p9.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional or production dramaturges may make files of materials about a play's history or social context, prepare program notes, lead post-production discussions, or write study guides for schools and groups. These actions can assist a  director in integrating textual and acting criticism, performance theory, and historical research into a production before it opens.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Since dramaturgy is defined in a general way and the function of a dramaturge may vary from production to production, the copyright issues regarding it in the United States have very vague borders.

In 1996, there was debate based on the question of the extent to which a dramaturge can claim ownership of a production, such as the case of [[Jonathan Larson]], the author of the musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and Lynn Thomson, the dramaturge on the production. Thomson claimed that she was a co-author of the work and that she never assigned, licensed or otherwise transferred her rights. She asked that the court declare her a co-author of ''Rent'' and grant her 16% of the author's share of the royalties. Although she made her claim only after the show became a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway hit]], the case is not without precedent. For instance, 15% of the royalties of ''[[Angels in America]]'' go to playwright [[Tony Kushner]]'s dramaturge. On June 19, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original court's ruling that Thomson was not entitled to be credited with co-authorship of ''Rent'' and that she was not entitled to royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/in2/everythingisrent/articles/americantheatre5.html Scott. T. Cummings, ''American Theatre'', October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ultimately settled out of court with Thomson receiving an undisclosed sum after she threatened to remove her material from the production.

An '''extravaganza''' is a literary or musical work (often [[musical theatre]]) characterized by freedom of style and structure and usually containing elements of [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], [[pantomime]], [[music hall]] and parody. It sometimes also has elements of cabaret, circus, [[revue]], variety, [[vaudeville]] and [[mime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-199143/extravaganza |title=Encyclopædia Britannica online |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Extravaganza'' may more broadly refer to an elaborate, spectacular, and expensive theatrical production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ewen, David|title=Panorama of American Popular Music|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was widely used to describe a type of 19th-century British drama made popular by [[James Planché]].  Planché defined it as "the whimsical treatment of a poetical subject."&lt;ref&gt;Planché.  ''The recollections and reflections of J.R. Planché (Somerset herald): a professional biography'' (1872), Vol. II, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from the Italian word ''stravaganza'', meaning extravagance.

'''Fiction writing''' is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a [[short story]], [[novel]], [[novella]], [[screenplay]], or [[drama]], which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of [[author]]s practice  fictional writing, including [[novelists]], [[playwrights]], [[short story writers]], [[dramatists]] and [[screenwriters]].

==Categories of prose fiction ==
{{main|Fiction#Categories of fiction}}

===Genre fiction===
A [[genre]] is the subject matter or category that writers use. For instance, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[mystery fiction]] are genres. [[Genre fiction]] also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specific [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/categories/article_top.asp?catid=10&amp;id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction is storytelling driven by plot, as opposed to literary fiction, which focuses more on theme and character. Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is [[Twilight (novel series)|the ''Twilight'' series]] which may sell more than  [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'', because the "Twilight" novels deal with elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] – romance and vampires.

===Literary fiction===
[[Literary fiction]] is [[Fiction|fictional works]] that hold [[literary merit]],  that is to say, they are works that offer [[social commentary]], or [[political criticism]], or focus on aspect of the [[human condition]].

Literary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or [[genre fiction]]. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is [[Western canon#Debate|controversial]] among some critics and scholars.

==Elements of fiction==
===Character===
[[File:American author Jenna Blum photographed by Marcia Perez.jpg|150px|thumb|Author [[Jenna Blum]] described the process of creating a character: "It feels like having a string dangle out of thin air and you pull on the string, and the next thing you know, a sweater knits itself out of nowhere and you have a character who is made out of whole cloth."&lt;ref name=JennaBlum3&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 8, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, “...a character who is made out of whole cloth...”&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''[[Characterization]]''' is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style.  A '''[[fictional character|character]]''' is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.

Characters may be of several types:
*'''Point-of-view character''': the character by whom the story is viewed. The point-of-view character may or may not also be the main character in the story.
*'''[[Protagonist]]''': the main character of a story
*'''[[Antagonist]]''': the character who stands in opposition to the protagonist
*'''Minor character''': a character that interacts with the protagonist. They help the story move along.
*'''[[Foil (literature)|Foil character]]''':  a (usually minor) character who has traits opposed to those of the main character

===Plot===
The '''[[plot (narrative)|plot]]''', or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.

Plot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

The climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.

Plot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama—where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel—an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.

===Setting===
'''[[Setting (fiction)|Setting]]''' is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe.  Sometimes setting is referred to as '''[[Social environment|milieu]]''', to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.

===Theme===
'''[[Theme (literary)|Theme]]''' is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the "moral of the story." Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.

===Style===
[[Style (fiction)|Style]] includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of [[Narration|narrator]], but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.

For each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.

====Narrator====
The '''[[Narration|narrator]]''' is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.

====Point of view====
[[Point of view (literature)|Point of view]] is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tone====
The [[tone (literature)|tone]] of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suspension of disbelief====
'''[[Suspension of disbelief]]''' is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.

==Authors' views on writing==
Ernest Hemingway wrote "Prose is architecture, not interior decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Poore, ''New York Times'', "Hemingway's Quality Built On a Stern Apprenticeship", ?, ?1954, p. ?)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Stephen King]], in his [[non-fiction]], part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft]]'', he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: "Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's."{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

==Creative Writing 101: According to Kurt Vonnegut==
[[Kurt Vonnegut]] the author of praised novels ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', and ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', has given his readers, from his short story collection, ''[[Bagombo Snuff Box]]'', eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.

"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:

#Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.
#Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
#Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.
#Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.
#Start as close to the end as possible.
#Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.
#Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.
#Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30316">'''Fictional portrayals of psychopaths''', or '''sociopaths''', are some of the most notorious in film and literature but may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of [[psychopathy]], which is itself used with varying definitions by [[mental health professional]]s, [[criminologist]]s and others. The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself, or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work, which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or [[critic]]s based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy.

Such characters are often portrayed in an [[exaggeration|exaggerated]] fashion and typically in the role of a [[villain]] or [[antihero]], where the general characteristics of a psychopath are useful to facilitate conflict and danger. Because the definitions and criteria in the [[history of psychopathy]] have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the film's production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several [[stereotypical]] images of psychopathy in both [[Layperson|lay]] and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming [[con artist]], the deranged [[serial killer]], the successful [[Psychopathy in the workplace|corporate psychopath]], or the chronic low-level [[crime|offender]] with [[juvenile delinquency]]. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of the mythical [[bogeyman]], fascination with human [[evil]], and sometimes perhaps [[envy]] of people who might appear to go through life unencumbered by the same levels of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anguish]] or [[Emotional security|insecurity]].&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skeem|first=J.

==Early depictions==
In the 19th century the diagnostic categories of [[monomania]] or [[moral insanity]] (the word 'moral' then meant either emotional or ethical) made their way into works of literature, covering numerous eccentricities, obsessions or breakdowns—and sometimes acts of apparently senseless criminality, occasionally violent. This period also saw the rise of [[crime fiction]] such as [[sensation novels]], where often someone in a local community who appeared normal would turn out to be criminally insane, and [[detective novels]], playing on increasing anxieties about the characters of people in the newly expanding and diversifying industrial cities.&lt;ref name=Thesing&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to the Victorian novel |author=Patrick Brantlinger, William B. Thesing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMWWh6yu3oEC |page=76 &amp; 236|isbn= 0-631-22064-X |year=2002 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'psychopath' came into use in the late 19th century (as did the term it would often be confused with, [[psychotic]]), and also spanned a very wide range of conditions ([[etymologically]] and originally equivalent to 'mentally ill'). Nevertheless, an early rise to prominence followed its use in a Russian trial between 1883 and 1885 concerning a child murder, contributing to the release of a probable false confessor while the original suspect was found guilty. 'Psychopaths' began to appear in [[vaudeville]]s, ditties (songs) and press articles. The psychopathy defense was reported internationally as having enabled a remorseless female child killer to go free, a usage still quoted in dictionaries today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2011: Psychopath: 1885 Pall Mall G. 21 Jan.

[[Degeneration|'Degenerates']] were also depicted in popular fiction of the 19th through to mid 20th century, sometimes in similar ways to the modern usages of the concept of psychopaths, sometimes being cited as a cause of psychopathy. The concept fell into disrepute due partly to its use by the Nazis to justify eradicating their opposition.&lt;ref name=Jalava&gt;[http://summit.sfu.ca/item/8120 Science of conscience: Metaphysics, morality, and rhetoric in psychopathy research] Jarkko Jalava, 2007, PhD at Simon Fraser University, then Professor at Okanagan College, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
The meaning gradually narrowed, initially as 'psychopathic inferiors' covering all of what today might be called [[personality disorders]] and various other conditions, then intertwining with the terminology of the 'sociopath' (and eventually [[antisocial personality disorder]]), though psychopathy remained variously defined in both broad and narrow ways.

Early representations of psychopaths in film were often caricatured as sadistic, unpredictable, sexually depraved, and emotionally unstable ([[mania|manic]]) characters with a compulsion to engage in random violence and destruction, usually with a series of bizarre mannerisms such as giggling, laughing, or facial [[tics]]. Up until the late 1950s, cinematic conventions usually relegated the psychopath to roles of genre villains such as gangsters, [[mad scientists]], [[supervillains]], and many types of generic criminals. Examples of this type are [[Pinkie Brown]] ([[Richard Attenborough]]) in ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'', Tommy Udo ([[Richard Widmark]]) in ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'', Cody Jarrett ([[James Cagney]]) in ''[[White Heat (film)|White Heat]]'', and [[Tony Camonte|Antonio 'Tony' Camonte]] ([[Paul Muni]]) in the 1932 version of ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]''. [[Homosexuals]] were also referred to as psychopaths under the broad definition then in use; the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in 1952 would list it under 'sociopathic personality disturbance'.

One exceptional depiction in this period was the character of child murderer Hans Beckert ([[Peter Lorre]]) in the 1931 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''. Lorre portrays Beckert as an outwardly unremarkable man tormented by a compulsion to ritualistically murder children. A German film (allegedly based on the real life [[serial killer]] [[Peter Kürten]]), it was released in America in 1933 and has been seen as indicative of a turning point in American media depictions of psychopaths. Until the 1930s psychiatrists typically applied the diagnosis to unemployed males or 'hypersexual' women, but several psychiatric, cultural and economic trends, together with [[sex crime]] panics, converged to transform the popular psychopath into a violent, male, sexual deviant or criminal—a threat to innocence, [[gender role]]s and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1908506?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102561687811 "Uncontrolled Desires": The Response to the Sexual Psychopath, 1920-1960] Estelle B. Freedman, The Journal of American History, Vol. 74, No. 1 (Jun., 1987), pp. 83-106. Also reproduced in [https://books.google.com/books?id=5jTjfFo42E8C Passion and Power: Sexuality in History (from Pg 199)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ostap Bender]] character from novels [[The Twelve Chairs]] and [[The Little Golden Calf]] by Soviet authors [[Ilf and Petrov]] is also considered a portrait of a charming psychopath.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.b17.ru/blog/11662/ Be cautious - socially adapted psychopath, damned attractive man]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tanja-tank.livejournal.com/34480.html sociopaths and narcissists in movies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennie Small from [[Of Mice and Men]], who is mentally retarded, has been described as also lacking a conscience or moral sense, a common definition of a [[psychopath]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/o/of-mice-and-men/character-analysis/lennie-small&lt;/ref&gt; His inability to stay out of trouble is often attributed to this.

==Mid 20th century==
One of the earliest real life cases which had a pervasive influence on American movies was that of [[Ed Gein]], arrested in 1957. A farmer who had resided with his mother until her death, he had then killed two women and dug up female bodies from the local [[cemetery]], making various items out of their skin. Rumours spread that he was also a [[necrophiliac]], [[cannibal]] or [[transvestite]], though these appear to have been unsupported other than by brief affirmations from Gein to [[leading questions]] by interrogators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_ZDUR7H_QMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Deviant] Harold Schechter, 1998, Pg 192, 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertcdaniels.com/ed_gein.htm#_ftn2 Ed Gein: the Cannibal Myth Exposed]&lt;/ref&gt; Gein was found mentally ill and legally insane before trial, deemed to have had [[schizophrenia]] (psychosis including [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]]) for at least 12 years, though at least one media psychiatrist dubbed him instead a 'sexual psychopath'.&lt;ref&gt;Gonyea, Floyd.

January 7, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bloch]], a prolific pulp horror author, says his 1959 novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' was based on the Gein murders and the idea of an apparently sane person in a local community committing heinous crimes, but not necessarily on Gein himself, despite numerous similarities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediageeknetwork.com/psycho-exclusive-an-interview-with-author-robert-bloch/ PSYCHO EXCLUSIVE: An Interview With Author Robert Bloch] By Ed Gross, Media Geek Network, November 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The villain, [[Norman Bates]], is portrayed as an outwardly unremarkable man who murders a woman while under the control of an [[disassociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] that takes the form of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his domineering mother]], who he himself murdered. Both the novel and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film adaptation]] were influences on the popular media portrayal of psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin-readers.com/pdf/downloads/pr/teachers-notes/9781405879286.pdf Teacher's Notes: Psycho] Penguin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC43folder/EdGein.html Ed Gein and the figure of the transgendered serial killer] by K.E. Sullivan. from Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media, no. 43, July 2000, pp. 38-47&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the book nor film elaborates on the term 'psycho', though it is commonly taken to refer to either psychotic or psychopath. At the end of the film, a psychiatrist describes Bates as having a split personality. [[Multiple personality disorder]] was at that time very popular (cf 1957 movie ''[[The Three Faces of Eve]]'') and is to this day commonly confused with [[schizophrenia]]. Bloch later wrote a script for the 1966 film ''[[The Psychopath]]'', the original working title for which was "Schizo".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Psychopath_1966 The Psychopath – 1966: Plot Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

A different thread within fictional portrayals of psychopathy continued to focus on rebelliously antisocial characters. The title of the 1955 film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', starring [[James Dean]], came from a 1944 book of the same name detailing the [[hypnosis|hypno]]-[[Psychoanalysis|analysis]] of a diagnosed psychopath. In the book, psychiatrist [[Robert M. Lindner]] also discussed psychopaths in general as pointlessly selfish individuals who appear unable to accept society's rules. In [[Ken Kesey]]'s 1962 novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', [[Randle McMurphy]], after being admitted to a mental institution, is repeatedly referred to by the authorities, other patients and himself as a possible or definite psychopath. He reads from his record: "repeated outbreaks of passion that suggest the possible diagnosis of psychopath", and adds that a doctor told him it means "I fight and fuh-pardon me, ladies-means I am he put it overzealous in my sexual relations." The current doctor then reads out the note: "Don't overlook the possibility that this man might be feigning psychosis".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/one-flew-over-cuckoos-nest/madness-quotes.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the script for the popular [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|film adaptation]] in 1975, only the latter is retained and the term psychopath is never used. Ironically, the main authority figure in the hospital—the cold, [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Nurse Ratched]]—was later described as a psychopath under later understandings of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LBIjsk-2ok4C The Psychopath in Film] 1999 By Wayne Wilson. Pg 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 20th century==
The 1973 film ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' involved two lead characters based loosely on  [[Charles Starkweather]] and [[Caril Ann Fugate]]. While the male lead Kit ([[Martin Sheen]]) is sometimes described as a psychopath or sociopath, psychologist [[Robert D. Hare]], a leading proponent of the assessment of psychopathy, has identified Holly ([[Sissy Spacek]]) as exemplifying his concept of a psychopath due to her poor emotional sense of the meaning of events and her attempted mask of normality. However, writer and director [[Terrence Malick]] has said he considered Kit's shallow, bitter insensitivity to be a result of suffering and neglect growing up in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and 15-year-old Holly, though immature and mis-estimating her audience, to be a quite typical [[Southern United States|Southern]] girl wanting to help narrate and come off well but still give the hard facts, and not dwell on herself or on personal tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xfIEVtzj52YC Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us] Robert D. Hare, Guilford Press, 1993/2011. Pg 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jSNCB6yCJPoC Terrence Malick] Lloyd Michaels, University of Illinois Press, 2009. Pg 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing media focus of serial killers in the late 20th century, fueled by cases such as [[John Wayne Gacy]] (1978), [[Ted Bundy]] (1978) and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] (1991), lent an additional momentum to the way psychopathy was both perceived and portrayed in film and literature, sometimes incorporating a hybrid of traditional psychopaths from early film and late-19th century literature with the high-functioning behaviors detected in some serial killers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc3228/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf Serial Killing Myths Versus Reality: A Content Analysis of Serial Killer Movies Made Between 1980 and 2001] Sarah Scott McCready, Masters Thesis, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1995.1801_87.x | volume=18 | issue=1 | title=Consuming Cannibals: Psychopathic Killers as Archetypes and Cultural Icons | year=1995 | journal=The Journal of American Culture | pages=87–96 | last1 = Grixti | first1 = Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychiatrist and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] serial killer [[Dr. Hannibal Lecter]], most notably portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]] in the [[Academy Award]]-winning 1991 film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', is perhaps the most infamous fictional psychopath of the 20th century. Lecter is intelligent and sophisticated (whereas psychopathy is generally associated with lower than average verbal [[intelligence]]&lt;ref name="LecterIntelligence"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeLisi|first=Matt|author2=Vaughn, Michael G.|author3=Beaver, Kevin M.|author4=Wright, John Paul|title=The Hannibal Lecter Myth: Psychopathy and Verbal Intelligence in the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=32|issue=2|pages=169–177|doi=10.1007/s10862-009-9147-z|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/staff/delisi/Hannibal%20Lecter%20PDF.pdf|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and his disarming charisma and wit disguise his true nature as a serial killer. He spends most of the film in a cell, taunting [[Clarice Starling]] with clues to the identity of another serial killer, [[Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)|Buffalo Bill]], in exchange for intimate details of Starling's troubled childhood. Lecter first appeared in [[Thomas Harris]]'  1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', in which he is characterized as not fitting any known psychological profile. In the film adaptation of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', he is referred to as a "pure psychopath".&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' and its first film adaptation, ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', FBI profiler [[Will Graham (fictional character)|Will Graham]] suggests that psychologists "say he's a sociopath" because they "don't know what else to call him". Shortly afterwards in ''Red Dragon'', Lecter's jailer [[Frederick Chilton]] says "...we thought he might provide us with a singular opportunity to study a pure sociopath...As it turned out, I don't think we're any closer to understanding him now than the day he came in." In the script for the film version of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', the same character calls Lecter a "pure psychopath". In the novel of the same name, FBI agent [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] tells Starling "I'm waist-deep in inaccessible patient evaluations of Dr. Lecter and they're all different" and Chilton later tells Starling "A pure sociopath, that's obviously what he is. But he's impenetrable, much too sophisticated for the standard tests."&lt;/ref&gt; In the later novels ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'' and ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'', Lecter's psychopathy is portrayed as the result of seeing his sister Mischa murdered and cannibalized during [[World War II]]. In 2013 Harris revealed that he originally based the Lecter character on Alfredo Ballí Trevino, a Mexican physician who had killed and dismembered his [[homosexual]] lover, in what was called a [[crime of passion]] over a financial dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/495908/20130731/hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-ball.htm Real Hannibal Lecter was Murderous Gay Mexican Doctor Alfredo Ballí Treviño] Umberto Bacchi, IB Times, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latintimes.com/articles/6867/20130730/real-hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-balli-trevino-inspiration-thomas-harris-silence-lambs-25-anniversary.htm Who Was The Real Hannibal Lecter?] Valdez, Latin Times, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[American Psycho]]'' tells the story of [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[yuppie]] serial killer working on [[Wall Street]] in the 1980s. It was made into a [[American Psycho (film)|film]] in 2000. Author [[Bret Easton Ellis]] has told interviewers that the book is a satire on shallow [[consumerist]] lifestyles, but also that the writing of the violent scenes was based on fictional horror and FBI material on serial killers, along with how he imagined "a psychotic who worked on Wall Street" would describe such incidents. Some commentary, including in scientific journals, has suggested the Bateman character appears to be a psychopath. However, Bateman also exhibits signs of psychosis such as hallucinations, and as such appears to be an [[unreliable narrator]]; it is left ambiguous whether Bateman is actually a serial killer, or is merely hallucinating about committing murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6127/the-art-of-fiction-no-216-bret-easton-ellis Bret Easton Ellis, The Art of Fiction]  No. 216.

In the 1993 book ''[[Girl, Interrupted]]'' and its 1999 [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film adaptation]], the character of Lisa (played by [[Angelina Jolie]] in the film) is a rebellious, antisocial young woman who is diagnosed as a sociopath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.cengage.com/psychology/resources/students/screen/screen_20000110.html Girl, Interrupted—Cuckoo's Nest Redux] By Elaine Cassel, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is left ambiguous whether that diagnosis is accurate.

The 1996 film ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' depicts a suspected murderer who appears to suffer from [[multiple personality disorder]], who at the end reveals that he has been faking the disorder. In the original novel by [[William Diehl]], the psychiatrist Molly Arrington and others repeatedly explain psychopathy and psychosis as if they are the same, inherently antisocial, condition.

''[[Harry Potter]]'' author [[J. K. Rowling]] has described [[Lord Voldemort]], the series' main villain, as "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering, and there ARE people like that in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0900-ew-jensen.htm|author=Jensen, Jeff. |title='Fire' Storm |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=7 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Numerous characters in television shows are informally described as psychopaths by the [[actors]] who play the parts. Examples include [[Natalie Buxton]] in ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badgirls.co.uk/library/int-s6-db.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean Slater]] and [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] in ''[[EastEnders]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bettingpress.com/category/Entertainment/Who-killed-Archie-Mitchell-update--Sean-Slater-now-favourite-in-Eastenders-betting-201002160062/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a373916/eastenders-michael-moon-is-a-psychopath-says-steve-john-shepherd.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dexter Morgan]] in the American show ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://darklydexter.com/articles/michael-c-hall-and-kevin-dutton-discuss-about-psychopathy/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jodie-comer-meet-killing-eves-pink-dressed-psychopathic-breakout-star-w520872&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] from the British TV soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'', is also known for having a serious personality disorder. His character is famous for presenting several tendencies of a sociopathic personality including, manipulation, lying, and aggression. He has served time in prison and often blames his mother for his traumatic childhood,  His character has matured over the years however, the mask tends to slip from time to time and he returns to his darker side, most recently when he helped hide a dead body with a terrifying, cold-hearted attitude.

[[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]], the title character in the FOX medical-thriller ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' is referred to as a sociopath multiple times by several characters throughout the course of the show.

[[Sherlock Holmes]], the lead character in the BBC series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', is referred to as a psychopath multiple times throughout the course of the show; in response to these claims, Holmes describes himself as a "high-functioning sociopath". He has also been described as having [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/magazine/06diagnosis-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetclaire.org/quotes/sherlock/series-two/the-hounds-of-baskerville/ |title=Sherlock "The Hounds of Baskerville" (Episode 2.2) &amp;#124; Planet Claire Quotes |publisher=Planetclaire.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]] novel ''[[I Am Not a Serial Killer]]'' and its sequels, ''[[Mr. Monster]]'' and ''[[I Don't Want To Kill You]]'', are narrated by John Wayne Cleaver, a teenaged diagnosed sociopath who lives by a rigid code of behavior in order to avoid becoming a serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fearfulsymmetry.net/ Author's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

One Chicago academic has argued in a review of TV trends that the contemporary fantasy of sociopathy/psychopathy is of someone whose emotional disconnection from others in society, rather than being the hindrance that it can represent in real clinical cases, enables them to be an amazingly successful manipulator due to a breakdown in the [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenewinquiry.com/features/why-we-love-sociopaths/ Why We Love Sociopaths]. Adam Kotsko, New Inquiry, April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary advice on writing psychopathic/sociopathic characters suggests that lack of a conscience and lack of empathy are always the chief characteristics, along with an ability to fool others, while the type of selfish antisocial behavior, and any secondary characteristics, can vary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5fPEQl7I5H0C&amp; Bullies, Bastards And Bitches: How To Write The Bad Guys Of Fiction].

In 2013, the video console game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was released with numerous references to psychopaths and sociopaths, including reports from a fictional psychiatrist. One of the lead characters, Trevor, is described both psychopathic and psychotic; the voice actor who played the part says he based his performance on [[Tom Hardy]]'s portrayal of [[Charles Bronson (prisoner)|Charles Bronson]] in the film ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/an-interview-with-steven-ogg-the-voice-of-gta-vs-trevor An Interview With Steven Ogg, The Voice Of "GTA V’s" Trevor].

Many [[board game]]s and [[video game]]s provide their own fictional setting, or are set in fictional settings defined by other media such as [[literature]] or [[film]]. '''Fluff''', in the context of such gaming fiction, refers to information that provides setting and context for the game.

By definition, fluff is never part of the proper game rules. As such, fluff has no impact on gameplay and can technically be ignored by the players without breaking the game or its rules; it could arguably be described as 'soft rules'. As a result, the concept may not be applicable for [[role-playing games]] where the rules are at the discretion of the [[game master]] and implied, contextual or otherwise 'soft' rules may be deemed valid and binding.

In the context of fiction, fluff is essentially synonymous with '[[Canon (fiction)|Canon]]', i.e. the body of all fiction deemed to officially shape and define the fictional setting. It often takes the form of [[short stories]] or background information found in rulebooks and game supplements, but can take any form. In highly developed, popular settings which have evolved beyond gaming, fluff may include anything from gaming supplements such as [[sourcebook]]s to [[novels]] or even [[movies]].

By contrast, in the same context the term [[blurb]] is typically used for brief explanatory texts (for individual gaming pieces etc.). Where they do not provide gaming rules for their subject, blurbs also fall under the definition of the fluff.

In some countries, such as the UK, the term "gaming" can also refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional [[Tabletop game|tabletop]] and [[Online gambling|digital forms]]. There are many different gamer [[Community|communities]] around the world. Since the advent of the internet, many communities take the form of [[Internet forum]]s or [[YouTube]]/[[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] [[virtual communities]], as well as [[Real life#As distinct from the Internet|in-person]] [[social clubs]].

A female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.&lt;ref name="Theesa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"/&gt;
According to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duggan |first1=Maeve |title=Who plays video games and identifies as a “gamer” |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/who-plays-video-games-and-identifies-as-a-gamer/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=17 September 2018 |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term "girl gamer" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[reappropriation|reappropriated term]], while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/10699-In-Defense-of-the-Casual-Gamer | title=In Defense of the Casual Gamer | publisher=Escapist magazine | date=30 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2014 | author=Heather Barefoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes==
Although men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a [[stereotype]] that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more [[Casual game|casual games]] which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0678-y|title=SpringerLink|last=|first=|date=|website=db16.linccweb.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.

===Professional gamer===
{{See also|eSports}}
[[Professional]] gamers generally play video games for [[prize]] [[money]] or [[salaries]]. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in [[competitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Schorn |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/19/60minutes/main1220146.shtml |title='Fatal1ty' article at CBS News |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2006-08-06 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type.

===Retrogamer===
{{Main|Retrogaming}}
A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, [[retro games]]—older video games and [[arcade game]]s. They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification in taxonomies===

A number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:
* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.
* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[Glitch|glitches]], and expose all game mechanics.
* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.
* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.
* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.
The [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatar==
{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}
{{See also|Player character}}
An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Similarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.

==Clans and guilds==
A [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).

==Identity==
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the "true gamer" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to "[[cinemaphile]]".&lt;ref name="escapistPublisherNote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play "enough" to qualify.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term "gamer", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

In August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named [[Gamergate controversy]]. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The [[Gamergate controversy]] concerns issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #GamerGate.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Demographics===
[[File:Hillary Rodham Clinton playing a Nintendo Game Boy video game on the flight from Austin en route to Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hillary Clinton]] playing a [[Nintendo Game Boy]] video game on a flight]]
Games are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-10-30-platform-not-gender-drives-gamer-differences-eedar|last=Nofziger|first=Heather|title=Platform, not gender, drives gamer differences

Public debates about gaming and gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt; Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by [[Nintendo marketing#Demographic shifts|Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics]].&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Market penetration of [[smartphones]] with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience,&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt;

While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun ‘Gamer’ Label}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of [[hispanics]] identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of [[African-Americans]] and 7% of [[whites]].&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt; The competitive [[fighting game]] scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant.&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|last=Bowman|first=Rich|work=Polygon|title=Why the Fighting Game Community is Color Blind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]].&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"/&gt; Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt;

===Casualization===
Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarrazin|first=Vincent|date=October 7, 2011|url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/video-games/article/casualisation-video-games|title=The Casualisation of Video Games|work=ina global|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]]|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of [[gameplay]] in established genres and franchises.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"/&gt; Compared to seminal titles like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'', more recent mass-market action games like the [[Call of Duty]] series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of [[interactive movie]]s.&lt;ref name="eurogamerDoom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-06-22-years-on-doom-retains-the-ability-to-shock|last=Stewart|first=Keith|work=The Guardian|title=22 years on, Doom retains the ability to shock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in [[retro games]] but missing from new releases.&lt;ref name="gamasutraAmnesiac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20141009/227370/Amnesiac_Heroes_Why_are_we_abandoning_gaming_history.php|last=Pepe|first=Felipe|work=Gamasutra|title=Amnesiac Heroes: Why are we abandoning gaming history?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/1201/articles/kirkpatrick|title=Constitutive tensions of gaming's field: UK gaming magazines and the formation of gaming culture|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Graeme|work=Gamestudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brendan Keogh]], these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; Belying these trends, games including ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Minecraft]]'' have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnathonSwift/20140110/208440/quotDumbing_downquot.php|last=Swift|first=Johnathon|work=Gamasutra|title=Dumbing down}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are "just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays ''[[Counter-Strike]]''"&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/|last=Harwell|first=Drew|work=The Washington Post|title=More women play video games than boys, and other surprising facts lost in the mess of Gamergate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls.&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"/&gt; [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]] argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref name="edgeDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |work=Edge |title=Too many gamers think diversity means dumbing down – it’s time to forget that outmoded view |date=August 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713174818/http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harvey Weinstein 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|Harvey Weinstein in 2011]]

In October 2017, the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' reported that dozens of women accused American film producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] of [[rape]], [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual abuse]] over a period of at least 30 years. More than &lt;!-- Do not insert higher numbers without citing a reliable source backing it up --&gt;80 women in the [[film industry]] have since accused Weinstein of such acts. Weinstein denied "any non-consensual sex". Shortly after the local news stations reported Weinstein's allegations, he was dismissed from [[The Weinstein Company]], expelled from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] and other professional associations, and disappeared from public view.

Criminal investigations into complaints from at least six women are ongoing in Los Angeles, New York City, and London. On May 25, 2018, Weinstein was arrested in New York, charged with rape and other offenses, and released on bail.&lt;ref name="BBC News 25 May 2018"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvey Weinstein charged with rape|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44257202|accessdate=25 May 2018|work=BBC News|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Times'' and the ''New Yorker'' jointly won the 2018 [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for their reporting on Weinstein. The scandal triggered many similar allegations against powerful men around the world, and led to the ousting of many of them from their positions. It also led a great number of women to share their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, or rape on social media under the [[hashtag]] [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]].

==Impact==
{{main|Weinstein effect}}

===In the United States===
The October 2017 allegations against Weinstein precipitated an immediate "national reckoning" against sexual harassment and assault in the United States,{{r|Rutenberg: Reckoning}} known as the "Weinstein effect". Compounded by other sexual harassment cases earlier in the year, the Weinstein reports and the subsequent "[[Me Too (hashtag)|#MeToo]]" hashtag campaign, which encouraged individuals to share their suppressed stories of sexual misconduct, created a cavalcade of allegations across multiple industries that brought about the swift ouster of many men in positions of power both in the United States and, as it spread, around the world.{{r|Cook/Simons|USA Today 2017-10-25}} In the entertainment industry, allegations led to the ousters of actors and directors alike. Most prominently, actor [[Kevin Spacey]], comedian [[Louis C.K.]], and filmmaker [[Brett Ratner]] had projects canceled following at least six allegations apiece.{{r|AP: Impact Nov 10}} Over 200 women accused filmmaker [[James Toback]] of sexual harassment.{{r|USA Today 2017-10-25}} In journalism, allegations led to the ousters of editors, publishers, executives, and hosts. In other industries, the [[celebrity chef]] [[John Besh]] and other executives in finance and public relations were removed.{{r|USA Today 2017-10-25|AP: Impact Nov 10}} As of November 25, 2017, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] was investigating 28 sex crime cases involving media figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haring|first1=Bruce|title=LAPD Has 28 Open Sex Crimes Investigations Of Hollywood And Media|url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/lapd-has-28-open-sex-crimes-investigations-on-hollywood-and-media-1202214547/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=November 26, 2017|date=November 25, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125223148/http://deadline.com/2017/11/lapd-has-28-open-sex-crimes-investigations-on-hollywood-and-media-1202214547/|archivedate=November 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] dubbed the "Silence Breakers" behind the #MeToo movement [[Time Person of the Year|''Time'' Person of the Year]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zacharek|first1=Stephanie|last2=Dockterman|first2=Eliana|last3=Edwards|first3=Haley Sweetland|title=TIME Person of the Year 2017: The Silence Breakers|url=http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/|accessdate=December 6, 2017|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206124523/http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/|archivedate=December 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; American journalists in conversation at [[NPR]] wrote of the series of allegations feeling like a [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] for societal treatment of sexual misconduct, distinguished from prior sexual misconduct public debates by the public trust put in the celebrity accusers, as opposed to prior cases of publicly unknown accusers.{{r|NPR: Tipping Point}} Other journalists doubted that the trend would hold.{{r|USA Today 2017-10-25}}

''The New York Times'' and ''The New Yorker'' jointly won the 2018 [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] "for their coverage of the sexual abuse of women in Hollywood and other industries around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laforme|first1=Ren|title=Here are the winners of the 2018 Pulitzer Prizes|url=https://www.poynter.org/news/here-are-winners-2018-pulitzer-prizes|accessdate=April 16, 2018|work=Poynter|date=April 16, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internationally===
The "Me Too" campaign spread to other countries and languages over social media in Asia, Europe, Latin and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Powerful men confronted as "Weinstein Effect" goes global|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/harvey-weinstein-effect-goes-global-powerful-men-confronted|accessdate=1 January 2018|work=CBS News|date=14 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, Canadian comedy festival founder [[Gilbert Rozon]] resigned and over a dozen individuals accused Quebec television host and producer [[Éric Salvail]] of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perreaux|first1=Les|title=Canadian entertainment leaders Gilbert Rozon and Éric Salvail resign amid sexual assault, harassment allegations|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ex-just-for-laughs-head-gilbert-rozon-faces-sexual-assault-harassment-allegations/article36661216/|accessdate=1 January 2018|work=The Globe and Mail|date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, allegations against multiple British politicians created [[Westminster sexual harassment scandal|a public scandal]] and led to the suspension and resignations of three officials. In France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willsher|first1=Kim|title=Allegations of sexual violence soar in France after Weinstein scandal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/france-sees-sharp-rise-in-reports-of-sexual-misconduct|accessdate=1 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; political organizations close to the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], in particular the [[Union Nationale des Étudiants de France]] (UNEF), were accused of systemic sexual harassment.

==Production==
Graphics were created by Marek Píša. Píša and Viktor Bocan participated in writing the screenplay. Sounds and music were the work of William Foldes. All characters are voiced by comedian Zdeněk Izer, a notable Czech impersonator, besides some female characters. The game has the same humorous style seen across Czech adventures such as [[Polda]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/52702/DPTX_2010_2_11230_0_322985_0_111952.pdf?sequence=1|title=Historie a kontext produkce počítačových

According to Miroslav Mrňa, the idea of a sequel was brought up by JRC, then an exclusive distributor for the first game; the developers found this proposition interesting so pursued it. Developments began in late December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/miroslav-mrna-o-horkem-lete-2-dgd-/Magazin.aspx?c=A000131_mirekmrnahl2b_bw|title=Miroslav Mrňa o Horkém Létě 2|last=Ticháček|first=Petr|date=January 4, 2000|website=iDNES.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team consisted of one scriptwriter, two programmers, three graphic artists and two musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/mirek-mrna-o-priprave-horkeho-leta-2-duh-/Magazin.aspx?c=A000131_miramrnahl2a_bw|title=Mirek Mrňa o přípravě Horkého Léta 2|last=Polách|first=Zdeněk|date=April 12, 1999|website=iDNES.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrna described the development and production process of the game in detail for iDNES.cz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/jak-se-vytvarelo-horke-leto-2-dgn-/zahranicni.aspx?c=991107_214105_pocnovinky_ond|title=Jak se vytvářelo Horké léto 2|last=Mrňa|first=Miroslav|date=November 8, 1999|website=iDNES.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Horke Leto 2, a watercolour-style design was made for the backgrounds, which were painted by hand then scanned into the computer.

While developers from Centauri Production wanted to make a second sequel to the game, they were unable to obtain the rights to the name "Horke Leto" or the main character Honza, however the title was still designed as a spiritual sequel. Its original title was meant to be Raiders of the Lost Casino, but this was only used for international distribution purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was announced in May 2005 for release in the third quarter of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluesnews.com/s/57146/raiders-of-the-lost-casino|title=Raiders of the Lost Casino|last=|first=|date=May 22, 2005|website=Blue's News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/une-video-de-raiders-of-the-lost-casino-41536.html|title=Une vidéo de Raiders of the Lost Casino|last=Poischich|first=|date=June 1, 2005|work=Gamekult|access-date=2018-10-02|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's original title was  "Raiders of the Lost Casino", a reference to the Indiana Jones film [[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]. the game's visual style is both cartoon-like and gritty.&lt;ref name="adventuregamers.com" /&gt; The game was originally supposed to be released in the first few weeks of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/2005/00014830.htm|title=Images: Raiders Of The Lost Casino joue de malchance|last=Writing staff|first=|date=December 16, 2005|website=Jeuxvideo.com|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later pushed to February of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stopgame.ru/newsdata/1966|title=Акелла срывает куш|last=|first=|date=January 12, 2006|website=StopGame.ru|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akella demonstrated the game as a work-in-progress at E3 2006.&lt;ref name="adventuregamers.com" /&gt; Akella planned an English release for the end of 2006.&lt;ref name="adventuregamers.com" /&gt; A French localisation would later be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuxpo.com/game_test-3562.html|title=Evil Days of Luckless John|last=|first=|date=2007|website=Jeuxpo.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and gameplay==
In ''Horké léto'', the player takes control of teenager Honza Majer, who must rescue his family after they were captured by cannibals. In ''Horké léto 2'', Honza Majer must retrieve the Purple Salamander artefact from the bandit One-Eye Dingo. ''Žhavé léto 3 ½'' sees the player take control of Honza's grandfather, the hapless protagonist Johnny Majer, in the 1920s as he verses the Mafia in the age of the prohibition. Set in the gangster age of the 1930s, the player takes control of the handsome street rat Johnny who inherits a casino, only to discover that there is a plot to expropriate it.&lt;ref name="adventuregamers.com" /&gt;

The first two games are point and click adventures controlled by the mouse. The third is mainly a point and click adventure with elements of stealth, fighting, driving, and shoot ‘em up.

==Critical reception==
===Horké léto===
Refresher.cz deemed it an average game, but noted that it didn't stop it from becoming a domestic hit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Doupe.cz wrote the game is one of the best Czech adventures that every player should play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doupe.zive.cz/clanek/horke-leto-aneb-majer-v-akci|title=Horké léto aneb Majer v akci|last=Gric|first=Kamil|date=June 21, 2001|website=Doupe.cz|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excalibur suggests that while the graphics and gameplay were nothing special, it was the dubbing into local languages that captured the imagination of Czecheslovakia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; PC Tuning deemed it one of the 10 best Czech games of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pctuning.tyden.cz/multimedia/hry-a-zabava/28514-top-10-nejlepsich-ceskych-her-vsech-dob?start=2|title=Top 10 nejlepších českých her všech dob|last=Jiříková|first=Lucie|date=November 27, 2013|website=PCTuning.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refresher thought it was the 20th best Czech title, praising its  funny dialogues and first-class dubbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://refresher.cz/25610-Vybrali-jsme-ty-nejlepsi-ceske-a-slovenske-hry-Shodnes-se-s-nasi-top-dvacitkou|title=Vybrali jsme ty nejlepší české a slovenské hry.

===Horké léto 2===
Upon a preview, Bonusweb hoped that the game's humour would outweigh its average graphics and animations making it an above-average Czech title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/horke-leto-2-cxg-/Preview.aspx?c=A000130_horkeleto2pre_bw|title=Horké léto 2 preview|last=Ticháček|first=Petr|date=July 25, 1999|website=iDNES.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonusweb.cz compared the title to [[Polda 2]], and ultimately decided that despite its limitations it was worth a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/horke-leto-2-cxg-/Recenze.aspx?c=A000213_horkeleto2_bw|title=Horké Léto 2|date=13 December 1999|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Žhavé léto 3 ½===
The game received mixed reviews from critics who enjoyed the game's artistic style and story but disliked its gameplay and interface.

[[File:President Barack Obama with David Letterman 09-21-09.jpg|thumb|Late-night talk shows often feature guest interviews. Here, [[Barack Obama]] is interviewed by [[David Letterman]].]]

A '''late-night talk show''' is a genre of [[talk show]] popular in the United States, where the format originated. It is generally structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The [[Late night television|late-night]] talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by [[Johnny Carson]] with ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on [[NBC]]. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a [[house band]] which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during [[Television advertisement|commercial breaks]] and occasionally will back up a guest artist.

Late-night talk shows are a popular format in the United States, but are not as prominent in other parts of the world. Shows that loosely resemble the format air in other countries, but generally air weekly as opposed to the nightly airings of those in the United States. They also generally air in time slots considered to be [[prime time]] in the United States.

== History ==

=== United States ===
{{main|List of late-night American network TV programs}}

==== 1940s–1960s ====
Late-night talk shows had their genesis in early variety shows, a format that migrated to television from radio, where it had been the dominant form of light entertainment during most of the [[old-time radio]] era. ''[[The Pepsodent Show]]'', which opened each weekly episode with host [[Bob Hope]]'s rapid-fire, topical and often political [[observational comedy]], was a particularly important predecessor to the late-night format.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/bob-hope-film/9661/ This Is Bob Hope…]" ''[[American Masters]]'' (November 13, 2017). Retrieved November 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early television variety shows included ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (originally known as ''Toast of the Town''), which aired on [[CBS]] Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971 and was hosted by [[Ed Sullivan]], and ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' with [[Milton Berle]], which aired on NBC from 1948 to 1956. These shows aired once a week in evening time slots that would come to be known as [[prime time]].

The first show to air in a late night time slot itself, ''[[Broadway Open House]]'', aired on NBC in 1950 and ended a year later after host [[Jerry Lester]] left the show, infuriated at being upstaged by his sidekick [[Dagmar (American actress)|Virginia "Dagmar" Lewis]]. (As it was, there were also not yet enough television sets in the United States to make television broadcasting in late-night viable; Lester himself was a last-minute replacement host for up-and-coming 26-year-old comic [[Don Hornsby]], who caught polio and died less than a week before the show began.)

The first version of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]'', debuted in 1954 on [[NBC]]. The show created many modern talk show staples including an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, comedy bits, and musical performances. By this point, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] had lifted a freeze on new television stations, which allowed new stations to pop up across the country, and television adoption soon grew exponentially. As a result, unlike ''Broadway Open House'', ''Tonight'' proved to be a resounding success.

The success of the show led Allen to get another show, entitled ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', which would compete with ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on Sunday nights. Meanwhile, hosting duties of ''The Tonight Show'' were split between Allen and [[Ernie Kovacs]]; Kovacs had defected to NBC from his own late-night show on the then-crumbling [[DuMont Television Network]]. Both Allen and Kovacs departed from ''Tonight'' in 1957 in order to focus on Allen's Sunday night show. After the two left, the format changed similar to that of ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' and was renamed ''Tonight! America After Dark'' and was hosted first by [[Jack Lescoulie]] and then by Al Collins while interviews were performed by [[Hy Gardner]], and a [[house band]] led by [[Lou Stein]]. The show was not popular leading to many NBC affiliates dropping the show. The show returned to the original format that year and was renamed ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]'', with [[Jack Paar]] assuming hosting duties.

The even greater success of the show during Paar's hosting resulted in many NBC affiliates re-airing the show. He was noted for his conversational style, relatively highbrow interview guests, feuds with other media personalities (his feuds with print journalists Ed Sullivan and [[Walter Winchell]] marked a power shift from print to television; Winchell's career never recovered from the damage), and mercurial personality; Paar famously quit the show in 1960 in a dispute over a censored joke but was allowed to come back a month later. Paar permanently left the show in 1962, citing the reason that he could not handle the work load of ''The Tonight Show'' (at the time, the show ran 105 minutes a day, five days a week), and he moved to his own weekly prime-time show, which would run until 1965.

After Paar's departure, hosting duties were filled by [[Groucho Marx]], [[Mort Sahl]] and many others. Johnny Carson took over as host of ''The Tonight Show'' in 1962 and the show was renamed ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Carson streamlined the format of the show, focusing more on entertainment personalities, tweaking the monologue to include more shorter jokes, and emphasizing sketch comedy. [[Ed McMahon]] served as Carson's announcer while from 1962 to 1966 the band was led by [[Skitch Henderson]], who hired, among others, [[Doc Severinsen]]. When Henderson left, Milton DeLugg took over. Severinsen took over in 1967, and served as bandleader with the [[The Tonight Show Band|NBC Orchestra]]. The show originated from [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]] in New York City but, as part of Carson's shifting the show toward a more entertainment-oriented program, moved to [[Burbank, California]] in 1972.

NBC's two other rivals during the early television era, [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], did not attempt any major forays into late-night television until the 1960s. ABC's first effort at late-night TV was hosted by [[Les Crane]], which pioneered the controversial [[tabloid talk show]] format that would not become popular until two decades later. Crane's show lasted only six months. Shorter still was ''[[The Las Vegas Show]]'', a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]-based late-night show hosted by [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill Dana]] that was the only offering of the [[United Network]] that ever made it to air (because that network only had a handful of affiliates, it also syndicated to CBS, ABC and independent stations); it, along with the network, only lasted five weeks in summer 1967. Steve Allen himself returned to late-night in syndication twice in this time frame, first with a show that ran from 1962 to 1964 and then with a series that ran from 1968 to 1971. ABC added the ''[[Joey Bishop]]'' Show to its late night lineup in 1967, employing a talk show format, in an attempt to rival the Tonight Show, which lasted until 1969. CBS went without late-night TV until 1969, when it acquired ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' from syndication; Griffin returned to syndication in 1972, and CBS would not air any further late-night talk shows until 1989, instead opting for reruns, lifestyle programs and imported Canadian dramas in the time slot. By the 1960s, NBC had already cornered the market for late-night television viewing and would go on to dominate the ratings for several decades.

==== 1970s–1980s ====
A [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act|nationwide prohibition]] on [[tobacco advertising]] that took effect in 1971 prompted NBC to extend its broadcast day by an additional hour with programming it hoped would recuperate some of that lost revenue.&lt;ref name="Tom Snyder on Later, 1994"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmyB934SsDI Tom Snyder on ''Later'', 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, NBC launched two new programs: a concert series ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' that aired Friday nights, and a low-cost talk show, ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'' hosted by [[Tom Snyder]], that aired Mondays through Thursdays. Both shows aired immediately following Carson's ''Tonight Show'' at 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]. ''Tomorrow'' was different from ''The Tonight Show''. For instance, the show featured no studio audience, while Snyder would conduct one-on-one interviews (Snyder's guest list was often more eclectic and would sometimes include the intellectuals that Carson had long since abandoned) with a cigarette in hand.  Carson's new contract in 1980 allowed him to cut the length of his show from 90 minutes to 60 minutes, and for a short time, ''Tomorrow'' was moved to an earlier timeslot. NBC felt that Snyder's more conversational style would not bring in enough viewership in the earlier time slot, forcibly changed the show's format to resemble Carson's, and added gossip reporter [[Rona Barrett]] as a co-host. The two did not get along and had an acrimonious relationship on and off the air. The agreement gave Carson's production company ownership of the timeslot following ''Tonight'', which, a year later, Carson Productions and NBC used to create ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. When NBC offered Snyder the time slot after Letterman, he refused it, having always been resentful of the forced change in format, and ''[[NBC News Overnight]]'', a newscast, took the slot instead.

During his tenure as host of ''The Tonight Show'', Carson became known as ''The King of Late Night''. While numerous hosts ([[Merv Griffin]] and [[Dick Cavett]] being the best-known) attempted to compete with Carson, none was ever successful in drawing more viewers than Carson did on ''Tonight'', not even ABC's short-lived revival of Paar's show in 1973 using the name ''Jack Paar Tonite''.  Much like Paar, Carson became tired of fulfilling the workload of 525 minutes a week, so as local newscasts expanded, ''The Tonight Show'' was shortened to 90 minutes and again to 60 minutes in 1980 with 15 weeks of vacation a year.  Because of a lack of competition, Carson was free to take time off (Carson, by 1980, was only hosting three new shows a week) and invite guest hosts to host the show on a weekly basis, and for weeks at a time when Carson was on vacation including [[Joey Bishop]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Letterman]], [[Bob Newhart]], [[Don Rickles]], [[David Brenner]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].

In his final years, Carson produced new shows only three nights a week with guest hosts and "Best of Carson" reruns the other two nights. From 1983 to 1986, Rivers and Brenner served as Carson's permanent guest hosts. Many in 1986, including top executives at NBC, thought it was possible that Johnny Carson would retire after reaching his 25th anniversary on October 1, 1987, as it was such a logical cut-off point. In the spring of 1986, a confidential memo between top NBC executives listing about ten possible replacements in the event of Carson's retirement the next year was leaked. When Rivers saw it, she was shocked to see that she was nowhere on the list despite the fact that she had been ''The Tonight Show'''s permanent guest host since 1983. In 1986, Joan Rivers joined the brand new [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, where she would host her own late night talk show, ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'' which competed directly against ''The Tonight Show''. [[Clint Holmes]] served as Rivers' announcer while [[Mark Hudson (musician)|Mark Hudson]] served as bandleader. Carson was incensed that Rivers did not consult him beforehand and never spoke to Rivers again.

Brenner also left ''Tonight'' in 1986, although he did so amicably, to launch a syndicated 30 minute late night talk show called ''[[Nightlife (talk show)|Nightlife]]'' which was cancelled after one season.

[[Garry Shandling]], who had been a frequent guest host in the early 80's, served as permanent guest host, alternating with [[Jay Leno]], from 1986 to 1987 when he left to focus on his cable show leaving Leno to be Carson's sole guest host.

Carson did not retire in 1987, instead continuing as host until 1992 with Leno as sole permanent guest host. Rivers was fired from ''The Late Show'' in 1987 after abysmal ratings and a battle with network executives, leading to her being replaced by [[Arsenio Hall]]. Hall performed extremely well in the 18–49 demographic, however Fox had already greenlit ''[[The Wilton North Report]]'' to replace ''The Late Show'', leading to Hall hosting his own late night talk show in syndication after ''The Late Show'' was cancelled in 1988. ''The Late Show'' continued with many unknown hosts until its cancellation. Hall's syndicated show, ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', began in syndication in 1988, becoming more popular among younger viewers than Carson. The last network attempt at a Carson competitor, CBS's ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]'', lasted less than sixteen months, debuting in 1989 and being cancelled in 1990. ABC opted not to compete against Carson with a late night talk show, instead counterprogramming with a successful [[news magazine]] entitled ''[[Nightline]]'' beginning in 1980.

==== 1992–2009 ====
Carson retired as host of ''The Tonight Show'' in 1992 following his 30th anniversary as host. This garnered major media attention and speculation on who would replace Carson. The two candidates were [[David Letterman]] (host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' since 1982) and [[Jay Leno]] (Carson's regular guest host since 1987). Leno was eventually chosen, leading to Letterman leaving the network to launch a directly competitive late-night talk show, the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on CBS in 1993. ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' debuted in 1992. Letterman was replaced by newcomer [[Conan O'Brien]] as host of ''Late Night''. Arsenio Hall's show lost numerous affiliates after Letterman's debut and his show was canceled one year later. Fox returned to late night television in September 1993 with ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'' hosted by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumnus [[Chevy Chase]]. However, due to sagging ratings, disastrous reviews and Chase's embitterment at not being allowed to do the show the way he wanted to host it, the show was cancelled the following month. Even MTV entered the late night contest when it debuted ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], which ran until 1995. Letterman initially won the late night ratings battle but fell behind Leno in 1995; Leno generally remained in first place until first leaving ''Tonight'' in 2009. To combat NBC's ''Late Night'', David Letterman created ''[[The Late Late Show (U.S.)|The Late Late Show]]'' to follow Letterman at 12:37; the first host was former host of ''The Tomorrow Show'' Tom Snyder, who hosted the show using the same format he had used on ''Tomorrow'' until his departure in 1999. ''The Late Late Show's'' second host, [[Craig Kilborn]], followed a more conventional (albeit low-budget) late-night format; had previously served as host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', a late night satirical news program on [[Comedy Central]], and upon Kilborn's departure, Jon Stewart replaced him on that show. Perhaps one of the most unusual late night hosts to come out of this boom was basketball player and later entrepreneur [[Magic Johnson]], whose syndicated ''[[The Magic Hour (talk show)|The Magic Hour]]'' was a major flop and effectively ended any future efforts at a syndicated late-night talk show at that point in time.

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] finally re-entered the late night comedy fray in 1997 by installing ''[[Politically Incorrect]] with [[Bill Maher]]'' (which had aired on [[Comedy Central]] from 1993 to 1996) into its lineup after ''Nightline''. Unlike traditional late-night talk shows, ''Politically Incorrect'' was a half-hour in length and (following a brief host monologue) featured a panel of four guests debating topical issues while Maher moderated in a comedic fashion.

Many late-night talk shows went off the air in the days following the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001, while many of their networks aired round-the-clock news coverage. Letterman was the first to return on September 17, addressing the situation in an opening monologue. The show was not presented in its normal jovial manner, and featured [[Dan Rather]], [[Regis Philbin]], and a musical performance from [[Tori Amos]]. ''Politically Incorrect'' also resumed on September 17 and [[Politically Incorrect#Controversy and cancellation|immediately drew controversy]] due to remarks Maher and a guest ([[Dinesh D'Souza]]) made concerning the "coward" label given to the terrorists by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]]. ''The Tonight Show'' returned the following night, featuring [[John McCain]] and a performance from [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]].

''Politically Incorrect'' was canceled due to low ratings in the summer of 2002, after which Maher joined [[HBO]] and began hosting the similarly formatted weekly series ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]]''. ABC then tapped Comedy Central personality [[Jimmy Kimmel]] to host his own late night talk show (in a more traditional format) and named it ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. From its beginning in 2003 until early 2013, the show aired behind ''[[Nightline]]'' in ABC's nightly lineup. In early 2013, ABC promoted ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' to the 11:35pm slot, while ''Nightline'' was relegated to 12:35am.

[[Jake Sasseville]] entered the late night arena after a self-syndication campaign got him clearance on several ABC affiliates by local general managers in 2008. ''[[The Edge with Jake Sasseville]]'' aired after ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' in markets reaching a total of 35 million homes, despite the network's concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nolan|first=Clancy|title=Late-Night Hustler|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/43864/|publisher=New York Magazine|date=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show went off the air in 2010. Another syndicated show that earned significant clearance in the late 2000s was ''[[Comics Unleashed]]'', a panel comedy show that lasted only one season but ran in reruns for several years afterward.

[[Scotland|Scottish]] native [[Craig Ferguson]] succeeded Kilborn as host of ''The Late Late Show'' in 2005, renaming it ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''. [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] entered the late night scene in 2009 when it debuted ''[[Lopez Tonight]]'', hosted by comedian [[George Lopez]]. On September 27, 2004, the 50th anniversary of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''{{'}}s debut, NBC announced that Jay Leno would be succeeded by [[Conan O'Brien]], in 2009. Leno explained that he did not want to see a repeat of the hard feelings and controversy that occurred when he was given the show over [[David Letterman]] following Carson's retirement in 1992.&lt;ref name="Conan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6115643/|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|title=Leno promises smooth transition to O'Brien|date=September 28, 2004|accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conan2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/27/leno.obrien/|publisher=CNN|title=O'Brien to replace Leno on 'The Tonight Show'|date=September 27, 2004 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien's last ''Late Night'' episode was taped on February 20, 2009.

[[The Colbert Report]] that aired four days a week on [[Comedy Central]] from October 17, 2005, was hosted by [[Stephen Colbert]], one of the regulars on Comedy Central's [[The Daily Show]].

The popularity of late-night shows in the United States has been cited as a key factor why Americans do not get the requisite seven to eight hours of sleep per night.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8450575.stm "This diet of TV late at night is a key reason up to 40% of Americans get less than the "recommended" seven to eight hours of sleep, according to recent research from the University of Pennsylvania."&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, late-night talk shows have competed for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Talk Series]]; prior to that, the genre competed against general variety shows for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series]].

''The Jay Leno Show'' ended after a short run on February 9, 2010, due to low ratings, which, combined with NBC's poor prime-time performance at the time, affected viewership of its lead-out late newscasts on many NBC stations.&lt;ref name="10pmleno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6620935.html|title=Jay Leno Taking Over 10 pm On NBC|publisher=BroadcastingCable|accessdate=December 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, news broke that NBC was expected to part ways with Leno for good after his contract expired in 2014, clearing the way for Fallon (whose tenure at ''Late Night'' had found success with a young, culturally savvy audience) to take over ''The Tonight Show'' beginning that year, which also marked the 60th anniversary of the franchise. NBC confirmed the change on April 3, 2013. Under Fallon, the show returned to New York City, where the show originated from its 1954 debut until 1972; NBC no longer owns the former [[The Burbank Studios|company-owned studios]] in Burbank where Carson and Leno's programs originated (O'Brien's ''Tonight Show'' taped at nearby [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]]).

'''Magic''', along with its subgenres of, and sometimes referred to as '''illusion''', '''stage magic''' or '''close up magic''' is a [[performing art]] in which audiences are [[entertainment|entertained]] by staged tricks or [[illusion]]s of seemingly impossible feats using natural means.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Elise (3 May 2016).

It is one of the oldest [[performing arts]] in the world.

Modern entertainment magic, as pioneered by 19th century magician [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], has become a popular theatrical art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Recognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure|type=H.Res|number=642|date=March 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/642/text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, magicians such as [[John Nevil Maskelyne|Maskelyne]] and [[David Devant|Devant]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Harry Kellar]], and [[Harry Houdini]] achieved widespread commercial success during what has become known as "The Golden Age of Magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinmeyer|first=Jim|title=Hiding the Elephant|date=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, performance magic became a staple of [[Broadway theatre]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]s.

==History==
The term "magic" etymologically derives from the Greek word ''mageia'' (μαγεία). In ancient times, Greeks and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called ''[[magi|magosh]]'' in Persian, came to be known as ''magoi'' in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as ''mageia'', and then ''magika''—which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. During the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], who had a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. [[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]] in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.&lt;ref name="History of Magic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|title=History of Magic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=This French site, Magiczoom, has now closed its doors.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515125440/http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|archive-date=2006-05-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials.
Performances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout [[history]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=THE ART OF DECEPTION or The Magical Affinity Between Conjuring and Art | author=Romano, Chuck | journal=The Linking Ring |date=January 1995 | volume=75 | issue=1 | pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the [[Trojan Horse]] would also have been used for [[entertainment]], or at least for cheating in [[money]] games. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and [[cult]]s from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Magic tricks===
{{See also|List of magic tricks}}
Opinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then "restore" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.

[[File:John the Baptist illusion.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' (1584), one of the earliest books on magic tricks, explaining how the "Decollation of John Baptist" [[Guillotine (magic trick)|decapitation illusion]] may be performed]]
One of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, ''Natural and Unnatural Magic'', which describes and explains old-time tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin|authorlink=Harry Houdini|first=Harry|last=Houdini|page=19|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1584, Englishman [[Reginald Scot]] published ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their "magic tricks" were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were [[sleight-of-hand]] manipulations with rope, paper and coins.  At the time, fear and belief in [[witchcraft]] was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/05/10-facts-about-magicians/ |title=10 Facts About Magicians – Andi Gladwin&amp;nbsp;– Close-Up Magician |publisher=Illusionist.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=Philip C.|title=King James I and the burning of Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft: The invention of a tradition|journal=Notes and Queries|year=2009|volume=56|issue=2|pages=209–213|doi=10.1093/notesj/gjp002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including ''The Art of Conjuring'' (1614) and ''The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling'' (c. 1675).

[[File:Fawkesshow.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for [[Isaac Fawkes]]' show from 1724 in which he boasts of the success of his performances for the King and Prince George]]
Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of [[sword swallowing]], [[juggling]] and [[fire breathing]]. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, [[Isaac Fawkes]], who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s – he even claimed to have performed for [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:
{{quote|He takes an empty bag, lays it on the Table and turns it several times inside out, then commands 100 Eggs out of it and several showers of real Gold and silver, then the Bag beginning to swell several sorts of wild fowl run out of it upon the Table. He throws up a Pack of Cards, and causes them to be living birds flying about the room. He causes living Beasts, Birds, and other Creatures to appear upon the Table. He blows the spots of the Cards off and on, and changes them to any pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Christopher | first = Milbourne | title = Magic: A Picture History | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1991| location=New York|isbn=0-486-26373-8|page=16| origyear=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1756 to 1781, [[Jacob Philadelphia]] performed feats of magic, sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions, throughout [[Europe]] and in [[Russian Empire|Russia]].

===Modern stage magic===
[[File:roberthoudin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], pioneer of modern magic entertainment]]
A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, [[John Henry Anderson]] and [[Alexander Herrmann]].

[[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]]. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as ''The Great Wizard of the North''. His success came from [[advertising]] his shows and captivating his audience with expert [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]]. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in [[Glasgow]] in 1845.

[[File:John Nevil Maskelyne.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Nevil Maskelyne]], a famous magician and illusionist of the late 19th century.]]
Towards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.&lt;ref name="History of Magic"/&gt; The [[United Kingdom|British]] performer [[John Nevil Maskelyne|J N Maskelyne]] and his partner Cooke were established at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly]] in 1873 by their manager [[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]], and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often [[Orientalism|Oriental]]) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view.
Maskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today – one of his best-known being [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation]].&lt;ref name="Dawes_2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Great Illusionists|first=Edwin|last=Dawes|publisher=Chartwell Books Inc.|year=1979|page=161|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for the look of a 'typical' magician—a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat—was [[Alexander Herrmann]] (February 10, 1844&amp;nbsp;– December 17, 1896), also known as Herrmann the Great.  Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the "first-family of magic".

The escapologist and magician [[Harry Houdini]] took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as [[escapology]]. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a [[Houdini Museum]] dedicated to him in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].

[[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] was formed in London in 1905  to promote and advance the art of stage magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/about-the-club|title=About The Magic Circle|author=Jack Delvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included [[Okito]], [[David Devant]], [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]], [[Harry Blackstone Jr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Theodore Annemann]], [[Richard Valentine Pitchford|Cardini]], [[Joseph Dunninger]], [[Dai Vernon]], [[Fred Culpitt]], [[Tommy Wonder (magician)|Tommy Wonder]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], and [[Doug Henning]]. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[James Randi]], [[Penn and Teller]], [[David Blaine]], [[Criss Angel]], [[Hans Klok]] and [[Derren Brown]]. Well-known women magicians include [[Dell O'Dell]] and [[Dorothy Dietrich]]. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production [[visual effects]].

Many of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, "it's all done with smoke and mirrors", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous [[Pepper's Ghost]], a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.

==Types of magic performance==
Magic is often described according to various specialities or genres.
[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|upright|A [[mentalist]] on stage in a mind-reading performance, 1900]]
[[File:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amateur]] magician performing "children's magic" for a birthday party audience]]
*'''[[Stage illusions]]''' are performed for large audiences, typically within a theatre or auditorium. This type of magic is distinguished by large-scale props, the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers. Famous stage illusionists, past and present, include [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Chung Ling Soo]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], and [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]]
*'''[[Parlor magic]]'''  is done for larger audiences than close-up magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'' by T.A. Waters, "The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance." Also, many magicians consider the term "parlor" old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be "platform", "club" or "cabaret". Examples of such magicians include [[Jeff McBride]], [[David Abbott (magician)|David Abbott]], [[Channing Pollock (magician)|Channing Pollock]], [[Black Herman]], and [[Fred Kaps]]. 
*'''[[Micromagic]]''' (also known as '''close-up magic''' or '''table magic''') is performed with the audience close to the magician, sometimes even one-on-one. It usually makes use of everyday items as props, such as [[playing card|cards]] (see [[Card manipulation]]), [[coin]]s (see [[Coin magic]]), and seemingly 'impromptu' effects. This may be called "table magic", particularly when performed as dinner entertainment. [[Ricky Jay]], [[Mahdi Moudini]], and [[Lee Asher]], following in the traditions of [[Dai Vernon]], [[Slydini]], and [[Max Malini]], are considered among the foremost practitioners of close-up magic.
*'''[[Escapology]]''' is the branch of magic that deals with escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Harry Houdini]] is a well-known example of an ''escape artist'' or ''escapologist''.
*'''[[Pickpocket]]''' magicians use magic to misdirect the audience while removing wallets, belts, ties and other personal effects. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known pickpockets include [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]], [[David Avadon]], [[Bob Arno]], and [[Apollo Robbins]].
*'''[[Mentalism]]''' creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and similar feats. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known mentalists of the past and present include [[Alexander (magician)|Alexander]], [[The Zancigs]], [[Axel Hellstrom]], [[Dunninger]], [[Kreskin]], [[Derren Brown]], [[Rich Ferguson (magician)|Rich Ferguson]], [[Guy Bavli]], [[Banachek]], and [[Alain Nu]].
*'''[[Theatrical séances]]''' simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect. This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits.
*'''[[Children's magic]]''' is performed for an audience primarily composed of children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday schools or libraries. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants.
*'''Online magic tricks''' were designed to function on a computer screen. The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmagic.net/dp/1-1.htm |title=online magic tricks magical illusions |publisher=Real Magic |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a [[viral phenomenon]] that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that [[Snopes]] dedicated a page to debunking the trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/psychic.asp |title=Online Psychic Trick |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mathemagician|Mathemagic]]''' is a genre of stage magic that combines magic and [[mathematics]]. It is commonly used by [[children's magic]]ians and [[mentalists]].
*'''Corporate magic''' or '''trade show magic''' uses magic as a communication and sales tool, as opposed to just straightforward entertainment. Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches. They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their patter and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock&lt;ref name="Herz1991"&gt;Bill Herz with Paul Harris. ''Secrets of the Astonishing Executive''(New York, NY: Avon Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guy Bavli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-about-magicians.com/guy-bavli.html |title=Guy Bavli – Biography |publisher=All About Magicians.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masterofthemind.com/press/Guy%20Bavli%20-%20dream-team%20IBC%20Award-PR2000.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Gospel magic]]''' uses magic to catechize and evangelize. Gospel magic was first used by [[St. Don Bosco]] to interest children in 19th-century [[Turin]], [[Italy]] to come back to school, to accept assistance and to attend church.
*'''[[Street magic]]''' is a form of street performing or [[busking]] that employs a hybrid of stage magic, platform and close-up magic, usually performed '[[theatre in the round|in the round]]' or surrounded by the audience. Notable modern street magic performers include [[Jeff Sheridan]] and [[Gazzo (magician)|Gazzo]]. Since the first [[David Blaine]] TV special ''Street Magic'' aired in 1997, the term "street magic" has also come to describe a style of 'guerilla' performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street. Unlike traditional street magic, this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public. Magicians of this type include [[David Blaine]] and [[Cyril Takayama]].
*'''[[Bizarre magic]]''' uses [[Mysticism|mystical]], [[horror (genre)|horror]], [[fantasy]], and other similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is typically performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a stage setting. [[Charles Cameron (magician)|Charles Cameron]] has generally been credited as the "godfather of bizarre magic". Others such as [[Tony Andruzzi]] have contributed significantly to its development.
*'''Shock magic''' is a genre of magic that shocks the audience. Sometimes referred to as "geek magic", it takes its roots from circus [[sideshow]]s, in which 'freakish' performances were shown to audiences. Common shock magic or geek magic effects include eating razor blades, [[needle-through-arm]], string through neck and pen-through-tongue.,
*'''Comedy magic''' is the use of magic in which is combined with stand-up comedy. Famous comedy magicians include [[The Amazing Johnathan]], [[Mac King]], and [[Penn &amp; Teller]].
*'''Quick change magic''' is the use of magic which is combined with the very quick changing of costumes. Famous quick change artists include Sos &amp; Victoria Petrosyan.
*'''Camera magic''' (or "video magic") is magic that is aimed at viewers watching broadcasts or recordings. It includes tricks based on the restricted viewing angles of cameras and clever editing. Camera magic often features paid extras posing as spectators who may even be assisting in the performance. Camera magic can be done live, such as [[Derren Brown]]'s lottery prediction. Famous examples of camera magic include David Copperfield's Floating Over the Grand Canyon and many of [[Criss Angel]]'s illusions.
*'''Classical Magic''' is a style of magic that conveys feelings of elegance and skill akin to prominent magicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Notable classical magicians today include Yu Ho-Jin and Ryan Lally.

==Categories of effects==
Magicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider "penetrations" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as [[Guy Hollingworth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, Guy. "Waiting For Inspiration." Genii Magazine. January 2008 – December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Stone (magician)|Tom Stone]]&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Tom. "Lodestones." Genii Magazine. February 2009 -&lt;/ref&gt; have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as [[Dariel Fitzkee]], [[Harlan Tarbell]], S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.

*'''Production''': The magician produces something from nothing—a rabbit from an empty hat, a fan of cards from thin air, a shower of coins from an empty bucket, a [[Dove pan|dove from a pan]], or the magician himself or herself, appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage—all of these effects are ''productions''.
*'''Vanish''': The magician makes something disappear—a coin, a cage of doves, milk from a newspaper, an assistant from a cabinet, or even the [[Vanishing the Statue of Liberty|Statue of Liberty]]. A vanish, being the reverse of a production, may use a similar technique in reverse.
*'''Transformation''': The magician transforms something from one state into another—a silk handkerchief changes color, a lady turns into a [[tiger]], an indifferent card changes to the spectator's chosen card. [[File:Proyecto - cambio de color.ogv|thumb|Transformation: Change of color]]
*'''Restoration''': The magician destroys an object—a rope is cut, a newspaper is torn, a [[sawing a woman in half|woman is cut in half]], a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces—then restores it to its original state.
*'''Transposition''': This is whereby two or more objects are used in play. The magician will cause these objects to change places, as many times as he pleases, and in some cases, ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else. 
*'''Transportation''': The magician causes something to move from one place to another—a borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool, a canary inside a light bulb, an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theatre, or a coin from one hand to the other. When two objects exchange places, it is called a transposition: a simultaneous, double transportation. A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production.  When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation.
*'''Escape''':  The magician (or less often, an assistant) is placed in a restraining device (i.e., [[handcuffs]] or a [[straitjacket]]) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher.
*'''[[Levitation (illusion)|Levitation]]''': The magician defies gravity, either by making something float in the air, or with the aid of another object (suspension)—a silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid-air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician hovers a few inches off the floor. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including [[Asrah levitation]], [[Balducci levitation]], and [[King levitation]]. The [[David Copperfield's flying illusion|flying illusion]] has often been performed by [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] and more recently by [[Peter Marvey]].  [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.|Harry Blackstone]] floated a light bulb over the heads of the public.
*'''Penetration''': The magician makes a solid object pass through another—a set of steel rings link and unlink, a candle penetrates an arm, swords pass through an assistant in a basket, a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop, or a man walks through a mirror. Sometimes referred to as "solid-through-solid".
*'''Prediction''': The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event—a newspaper headline, the total amount of loose change in the spectator's pocket, a picture drawn on a slate—under seemingly impossible circumstances.

Many magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in "[[cups and balls]]" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.

The methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.

The teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drachen.org/article/magician%E2%80%99s-oath-conversation-pat-hammond-magic-science-and-wind|title=The Magician's Oath: A Conversation with Pat Hammond on Magic, Science, and the Wind {{!}} Drachen Foundation|website=www.drachen.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.

From the 1584 publication of [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.

Persons interested in learning to perform magic can join [[magic club]]s. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.

The world's largest magic organization is the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]]; it publishes a monthly journal, ''[[The Linking Ring]]''. The oldest organization is the [[Society of American Magicians]], which publishes the monthly magazine ''[[M-U-M]]'' and of which [[Houdini]] was a member and president for several years. In [[London]], [[England]], there is [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS—The British Society of Mystery Entertainers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=S.J.Drury [web-aviso.com] |url=http://www.psycrets.org.uk |title=psycrets.org.uk |publisher=psycrets.org.uk |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;—caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers. Davenport's Magic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davenportsmagic.co.uk] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; in London's [[Strand, London|The Strand]] is the world's oldest family-run magic shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/oldest-magic-shop] The [[Guinness World Records]], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magic Castle]] in [[Hollywood]], California, is home to the [[Academy of Magical Arts]].

Traditionally, magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience. Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. [[Stage illusions]] use large-scale props and even large animals. [[Platform magic]] is performed for a medium to large audience. [[Close-up magic]] is performed with the audience close to the magician. [[Escapology]] involves escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Pickpocket]] magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. 
[[Mentalism]] creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being [[Penn &amp; Teller]]. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, [[Confidence trick|con men]] and grifters who use deception for cheating at [[card game]]s.

==Misuse of magic==

Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term "magician" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of "illusionist" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer [[Jamy Ian Swiss]] makes these points by billing himself as an "honest liar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norman|first=Tony|title=Deception's his tool (but he's no politician)|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/tony-norman/2008/10/31/Deception-s-his-tool-but-he-s-no-politician/stories/200810310191|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist [[Joseph Dunninger]], who states "For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorable-quotes.com/joseph+dunninger,a4219.html |title=Memorable-Quotes.com |publisher=Memorable-Quotes.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the hugely successful illusionist [[Uri Geller]] made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent—and continues to bend—spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.

Less fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.

Fraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism religious movement]] as well as public interest in [[séance]]s, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] effects, which they attributed to the actions of [[ghosts]] or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist [[Harry Houdini]] devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Houdini. A Magician Among the Spirits (New York: Harper and Bros., 1924)&lt;/ref&gt;  Magician [[James Randi]], magic duo [[Penn and Teller|Penn &amp; Teller]], and the mentalist [[Derren Brown]] have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal, [[occult]], and [[supernatural]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi |first=James |date=February 9, 2007 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i6 |title=More Geller Woo-Woo |work=SWIFT Newsletter |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D02/020209morebrowne%2Ehtml |archivedate=July 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://affect.media.mit.edu/milliondollarchallenge/ One-Million-Dollar Challenge] from MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent [[faith healers]] have also been shown to employ [[sleight of hand]] to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet "tumors" from patients' abdomens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= The Skeptic's Dictionary |url= http://skepdic.com/psurgery.html |title= Psychic 'surgery' |author= Robert T. Carroll |date= 2009-02-23 |accessdate= 2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confidence trick|Con men]] and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at [[card game]]s is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, ''The Expert at the Card Table'' by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as "Find the Lady" or "[[Three-card Monte]]" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the [[shell game]], in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blankenstein. "8 Arrested in Downtown Shell-Game Operation," [[Los Angeles Times]], December 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researching magic==

Because of the secretive nature of magic, research can sometimes be a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Magic &amp; magicians http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic&lt;/ref&gt; Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magicol.magicana.com/ |title=Magic Collectors |publisher=Magicana |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the [[Conjuring Arts Research Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conjuringarts.org/ |title=conjuringarts.org |publisher=conjuringarts.org |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.

Performance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=83646&amp;sid=620815#1981235 |title=Magicians – Magic &amp; magicians – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the time.

Many books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic author&lt;ref&gt;Bart King, The Pocket Guide to Magic, Gibbs Smith, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers.

Several notable public research collections on magic are the ''WG Alma Conjuring Collection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic |title=Get started – Magic &amp; magicians – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the State Library of Victoria; the ''R.

[[File:Kölner Rosenmontagszug 2013 192.JPG|upright|thumb|A ''Funkemariechen'' ([[German language|ger.]] [[diminutive]] for "Glistering Mary") majorette is lifted at Rose Monday Parade of the [[Cologne Carnival]] in Germany]]
A '''majorette''' is a baton twirler whose twirling performance is often accompanied by dance, movement, or gymnastics; they are primarily associated with [[marching bands]] during [[parade]]s. Majorettes can also spin knives, fire knives, flags, light-up batons, rifles, maces and fire batons.  They do illusions, [[cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]], and [[flip (acrobatic)|flip]]s, and sometimes twirl up to four batons at a time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twirl-majorette.nl/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=43 "Twirl/Majorette info"]&lt;/ref&gt; Majorettes are often confused with [[cheerleaders]]; baton twirling, however, is more closely related to rhythmic gymnastics than to cheerleading.

==Origin and development==
Majorettes performed originally a typical [[carnival]] dance originating in the [[Rhineland]], where the young women who perform this dance are called "Tanzmariechen" (Dance Marys) in [[German language|German]] or ''Dansmarietjes'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

During the carnival the normal form of government is parodied. Also the army and the defense forces were traditionally parodied as a way of protesting against the Prussian occupation of the Rhenish area at the time. In [[Cologne]], these imitations arose in particular to make [[Prussian]] militarism look ridiculous. And with a joke army that did just about everything, it would make a normal company look ridiculous.

The tanzmariechen show clear origins in the camp followers in the 18th and 19th century, and have a vibrant and eventful past. Around this time Germany had a very large number of armies, and there would be young women in each regiment, who served during the day as sellers and providers of food and drink and took on household chores like washing clothes. At the same time, many of these women and girls offered themselves as prostitutes, for which they would dress themselves more provocatively, and they would dance for the soldiers.

Around 1800 more regulations began to emerge in the armies. Slowly these were also applied to the camp followers. Increasingly, the camp follower was a woman who was married to a corporal or private, and whose task it was among other things "to wash the linen", according to an old army decision.
The camp follower became not a typical army prostitute anymore, but also not a proper married women. Besides caring for the soldiers, she could still continue entertaining them in various ways.

In the carnival mockery both the officers and the camp followers were depicted. The officer by portraying him as an effeminate, wig-wearing, conceited fool, the camp follower as a woman who was military but provocatively costumed, but also clearly recognizable as a man: the Tanzmarie.

In the late nineteenth century, the carnival associations found further inspiration in the [[revue]] girls that performed in the theater at the time. These were scantily clad young women, accompanied by some military attributes like peak helmets and military backpacks, which showed provocative dances in small groups. The revue girl grew into a nightclub-like star. It can not be denied that the carnival with its Tanzmariechen has popularized and even parodied the sparkling shows that could otherwise be enjoyed only in the major European cities. Young women and girls again took on the role of tanzmariechen instead of men and they performed at the parades during the post-war carnival. A show element was added to carnival, partly because of rapidly evolving ballet education. Majorettes or tanzmariechen began increasingly to act in groups. Some parts of the Prussian military background are sometimes still reflected today in the movements, music or clothing of the majorettes.

The somewhat slovenly camp follower who accompanied the troops, has evolved into a show dance group, but still inspired by the Prussian army. This metamorphosis went through the intermediate step of the role performed by men as Tanzmarie.
Although the current majorette has her roots in the carnival scene, the associations of majorettes widely break these historical ties, and profile themselves more as a sports or dance club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fenvlaanderen.be/carnaval/wat-carnaval&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1699">A '''narrative designer''' is a role in contemporary [[video game]] development, the focus of which is to design the narrative elements of a game, and to champion story within the development process, which differentiates it from the role of [[video game writer|game writer]]. The ''Narrative designer'' was first defined by [[Stephen Dinehart]] in the 2006 Job Description he wrote for [[THQ]]. [[Narratology]] as a study has looked at the design of narrative as an artifact, [[narrative design]], in writing since its inception, but the role of the narrative designer in [[interactive storytelling]] differs in that it is an active process to create [[Narrative|story]] via a users navigation of a [[dataspace]].&lt;ref&gt;http://narrativedesign.org/2011/09/what-is-a-narrative-designer-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 'Narrative Designer' job position, was written by [[Stephen Dinehart]] for [[THQ]] Canada dba [[Relic Entertainment]] on the initiative of [[Tarrnie Williams]], Executive Producer, in 2006 to "champion story" based on his work on ''[[Medal of Honor]]''. The role that was eventually offered to and accepted by Dinehart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1530/narrative_design_for_company_of_.php Despain, Wendy (2006).

'''Narrative poetry''' is a form of [[poetry]] that tells a story, often making the voices of a narrator and characters as well; the entire story is usually written in metered verse. Narrative poems do not need rhyme. The poems that make up this genre may be short or long, and the story it relates to may be complex. It is normally dramatic, with objectives, diverse and meter.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''The Bedford Introduction to Literature'', Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005, p2134.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative poems include [[epic poetry|epic]]s, [[ballad]]s, [[idyll]]s, and [[Lyric poetry|lays]].

Some narrative poetry takes the form of a [[verse novel|novel in verse]]. An example of this is ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'' by [[Robert Browning]]. In the terms of narrative poetry, a [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] is a narrative poem that tells a story of [[chivalry]]. Examples include the ''[[Romance of the Rose]]'' or [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s  ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. Although those examples use [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Arthurian]] materials, romances may also tell stories from [[Mythology|classical mythology]]. 

Shorter narrative poems often similar in style to the [[short story]]. Sometimes, these short narratives are collected into interrelated groups, as with [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. So [[saga]]s include both incidental poetry and the biographies of poets. An example is "[[The Cremation of Sam McGee]]" by [[Robert W. Service|Robert Service]].

==Oral tradition==
{{Literature}}
The [[oral tradition]]  essentially all other modern forms of communication. For thousands of years, people groups accurately passed on their history through the Oral Tradition from generation to generation. As a clear example and the oldest one comes from Ancient India, the [[Vedic Chant]], which is often considered the oldest unbroken oral tradition in existence today. In addition, one of the most notable was the ancient Hebrews, people of the Middle East; they were taught and passed on the stories of God in over 115 countries worldwide. The poetry in the [[Bible]] is called the [[Psalms]], that capture stories of conquest, failure, confession and more. Some of it is narrative in nature.

Historically, much of poetry has its source in an [[oral tradition]]: in more recent times the [[Scotland|Scots]] and [[England|English]] [[ballad]]s, the tales of [[Robin Hood]], of [[Alexander the Great|Iskandar]], and various [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[hero]]ic poems all were originally intended for [[recitation]], rather than reading. In many cultures, there remains a lively tradition of the recitation of traditional tales in verse formativeness. It has been suggested that some of the distinctive features that distinguish poetry from [[prose]], such as [[metre (poetry)|metre]], [[alliteration]] and [[kenning]]s, at one time served as [[memory aid]]s that allowed the [[bard]]s who recited traditional tales to reconstruct them from [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Rubin (psychologist)|David C. Rubin]], ''Memory in Oral Traditions. The Cognitive Psychology of Epic, Ballads, and Counting-out Rhymes'' (Taco University Press, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative poem usually tells a story using a poetic theme. Epics are very vital to narrative poems, although it is thought those narrative poems were created to explain oral traditions. The focus of narrative poetry is often the pros and cons of life.

'''Narratology''' is the study of [[narrative]] and [[narrative structure]] and the ways that these affect our perception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/modules/introduction.html General Introduction to Narratology], College of Liberal Arts, [[Purdue University]]&lt;/ref&gt; While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is an anglicisation of French ''narratologie'', coined by [[Tzvetan Todorov]] (''Grammaire du Décaméron'', 1969).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Prince]], "Narratology," ''Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', ed. Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994) 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the [[Russian Formalists]], particularly [[Vladimir Propp]] (''Morphology of the Folktale'', 1928), and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theories of [[heteroglossia]], [[dialogism]], and the [[chronotope]] first presented in ''The Dialogic Imagination'' (1975).

==History==
The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the [[Structuralism | structuralist]] quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the [[Formal grammar|grammars]] used as a basis for [[parsing]] [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in some forms of [[linguistics]]. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; [[Percy Lubbock]]'s work in [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]] (''The Craft of Fiction'', 1921) offers a case in point.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1966 a special issue of the journal ''Communications'' proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"/&gt; It included articles by [[Barthes]], Claude Brémond, [[Genette]], [[Greimas]], [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov]] and others, which in turn often referred to the works of [[Vladimir Propp]]&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"&gt;Herman, David and Jahn, Manfred and Ryan, Marie-Laure (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], pp.574–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"&gt;Bamberg, Michael G. W. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HozLdEhiN-8C&amp;pg=PA40 ''Oral Versions of Personal Experience: Three Decades of Narrative Analysis. A Special Issue of the Journal of Narrative and Life History''], p.40{{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1895–1970).

[[Jonathan Culler]] (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between "story," a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and "discourse," the discursive presentation or narration of events.'&lt;ref&gt;
Jonathan Culler, ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'', Routledge Classics ed. (London: Routledge, 2001) 189.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Russian Formalists]] first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet [[fabula and sujet]]. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. ''histoire''/''discours'', ''histoire''/''récit'', ''story''/''plot''. The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ronen, "Paradigm Shift in Plot Models: An Outline of the History of Narratology", ''Poetics Today'', 11(4):817–842 (Winter 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg]], ''Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction'', (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1993.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], 1984, and [[Raphaël Baroni|Baroni]], 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphaël Baroni]], ''La Tension narrative. Suspense, curiosité et surprise'', (Paris: Seuil, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.

[[James Phelan (literary scholar) | James Phelan]], editor of ''Narrative'' (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list). With [[Frederick Luis Aldama]], [[Brian McHale]] and [[Robyn Warhol]], Phelan directs [[Project Narrative]] at [[The Ohio State University]]:)

==Applications==
Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term "narratology" is most typically applied to [[literary theory]] and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[film theory]] and (to a lesser extent) [[film criticism]]. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] studies of oral storytelling ([[William Labov]]) and in [[conversation analysis]] or [[discourse analysis]] that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, [[graphic novels]], the [[infinite canvas]], and narrative sculptures linked to [[topology]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt; Félix Lambert, 2015, "[https://www.academia.edu/11744670/Narrative_sculptures_graph_theory_topology_and_new_perspectives_in_narratology Narrative sculptures: graph theory, topology and new perspectives in narratology]." &lt;/ref&gt;
However, constituent analysis of a type where [[narreme]]s are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of [[linguistics]], [[semiotics]], or [[literary theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann, "[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1975a-theonarreme.pdf Théorie des narrèmes et algorithmes narratifs]," ''Poetics'' 4.1 (1975): 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Our Little Genius''''' is a [[game show]] produced for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network that was pulled before making it to air, hosted by [[Kevin Pollak]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-pollak-turns-genius-91959|title = Kevin Pollak turns "Genius"|first = James|last = Hibberd|date = December 3, 2009|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate = December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was slated to premiere on Fox on January 13, 2010, at 9:15 PM Eastern following ''[[American Idol]]'' with a special 45-minute episode, with further episodes being 60 minutes.&lt;ref name = "realitytvworld"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/fox-debut-mark-burnett-our-little-genius-game-show-january-13-9993.php|title = FOX to debut Mark Burnett's "Our Little Genius" game show January 13|first = Christopher|last = Rocchio|date = November 25, 2009|work = Reality TV World|accessdate = December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the show was postponed on request by its creator and eventually [[list of television series canceled before airing an episode|canceled]] before any episodes aired due to two separate issues related to the show's integrity.

According to Fox, [[child prodigy|child prodigies]] would answer trivia questions to win money for their families; their parents would be able to appeal to experts for help.&lt;ref name = "realitytvworld"/&gt;

==Cast and crew==
The show's producers were (in alphabetical order): Noah Bonnett, Mark Burnett, Lauren Franson, Ron Muccianti, Dave Schapiro, Tod Schellinger, John Stevens, Jenny Tyson and Chris Wagner.  Music was produced by David Vanacore. The film editors were Robert M. Malachowski Jr. and Hudson Smith. The casting department was Jennifer Cron and Joshua Robinson.

==Removal from schedule==
On January 7, 2010, one week before its scheduled premiere, the show's creator, [[Mark Burnett]], announced that he'd asked Fox to postpone it due to concerns about its integrity. Burnett said that issues with how information was relayed to contestants were serious enough that he felt compelled to reshoot the episodes. Fox supported Burnett's decision, and added that all contestants would keep their winnings.&lt;ref name="NYTInteg"&gt;Wyatt, Edward.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that some contestants may have known what questions were going to be asked (though not the answers) rather than just the topics to be covered.&lt;ref name="NYTInteg"/&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Burnett's main concern was that contestants somehow got more information than they should have prior to taping.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, Maria Elena.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 2010-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the abrupt pulling of the series, ''[[American Idol]]'' aired for 90 minutes that night, with a repeat showing of the "[[Once Upon a Time in Springfield]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' following at 9:30 PM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/07/foxs-our-little-genius-pulled-from-schedule-will-it-return/38003 |title=Fox’s Our Little Genius Pulled From Schedule, Will It Return?|last1=Gorman|first1=Bill |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.com |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=2016-09-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110020712/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/07/foxs-our-little-genius-pulled-from-schedule-will-it-return/38003|archivedate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "variety-fox-pulls-little-genius"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118013460.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title = FOX Pulls "Our Little Genius"|last = Schneider|first = Michael|date = January 7, 2010|work = Variety|accessdate = January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of cheating==
''The New York Times'' reported that a member of the production team gave a prospective contestant and his parents specific answers to at least four questions. If the show were found to be deliberately rigged, it would mark the first known instance of such a deception in America since the [[quiz show scandals]] of the late 1950s. Rigging a game show is a felony under the [[Communications Act of 1934]] ({{usc|47|509}}), which was added to the law in 1960 in the wake of the scandals.  The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has opened an inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, Edward [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/business/media/20genius.html F.C.C.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to theatre:

'''[[Theatre]]''' – is the generic term for the [[performing arts]] and a collaborative form of fine art involving live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event (such as a story) through [[acting]], [[singing]], and/or [[dancing]] before a live audience in a specific place. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of speech, gesture, mime, puppets, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts.  Elements of design and stagecraft are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carlson, ''Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism'', [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/view/1642/1606], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of theatre==

[[History of theatre]]

===Western tradition===
Chronological movements of the [[History of theatre#Western tradition|Western tradition]] include:
* [[Theatre of ancient Greece]] – a theatrical [[culture]] that flourished in [[Classical Greece|ancient Greece]] between c. 550 and c. 220 BC.  Tragedy (late 6th century BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (486 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there.  Western theatre originated in Athens and its drama has had a significant and sustained impact on [[Western culture]] as a whole.
* [[Theatre of ancient Rome]] – diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and [[acrobatics]], to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage.
* [[Medieval theatre]] – theatre of Europe between the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD and the beginning of the [[Renaissance]] in approximately the 15th century AD. Medieval theatre covers all drama produced in Europe over that thousand-year period and refers to a variety of genres, including [[liturgical drama]], [[mystery plays]], [[morality plays]], [[farce]]s and [[masque]]s.
* [[Commedia dell'arte]] – a form of theatre characterized by [[Mask#Masks in theatre|masked "types"]] which began in Italy in the 16th century, and was responsible for the advent of the actress and [[Improvisational theatre|improvised performances]] based on [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] or [[scenario]]s.
* [[English Renaissance theatre]] – also known as ''early modern English theatre'', refers to the theatre of England, largely based in London, which occurred between the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[closure of the theatres in 1642]].

* [[Restoration comedy]] – English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]]. Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness
* [[Restoration spectacular]] – elaborately staged productions beginning the late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable [[theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[baroque illusionistic painting]], gorgeous costumes, and [[special effect]]s such as [[trapdoor]] tricks, "flying" actors, and [[fireworks]].
* [[Neoclassism|Neoclassical theatre]] – theatrical movement that drew inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[Ancient Greece]] or [[Ancient Rome]] that was dominant in Europe from the mid-18th to the 19th centuries.
* [[Nineteenth-century theatre]] – wide range of movements in the theatrical [[culture]] of Europe and the United States in the 19th century.

* [[Striking a set]] – the act of taking apart the set, putting away all the props, lights, costumes, etc after the run of a production is over.
* [[Analyzing the text]] – Actors analyze the text (the script) for motivations, clues as to how their character behaves, or what their purpose is. Designers analyze to find out how many set changes are needed, lighting cues, sound cues, costumes needed, props, etc. Costume designers also have to analyze the script like the actors as the text can give clues as to how a character should be clothed.
* [[Spectacle]] – what the audience experiences.
* [[Rehearsal]]s – where the Actors and the director (and sometimes assistant director) start to plan the movements, the tempo, timing, the energy level of all the scenes.
* [[Dress rehearsal]]s – where all the components (Costumes, Lighting, Set, Props, Actors) perform the play from start to finish (usually over the span of a week) to not only get issues such as Set &amp; Costume Changes finalized and timed correctly, but to smooth out any minor issues with lighting, Sound, tempo, etc.
* [[Tech rehearsal]]s – rehearsals were the actors are not involved. It gives the sound, lighting, and running crew a chance to rehearse and create a rhythm that is proficient and smooth prior to dress rehearsals.
*[[Run-through]]s – The meaning of this term depends on the director. Generally, is can mean just running through an act with the actors (no technical aspects involved). Sometimes it can involve costume changes as those can become complicated if wig changes are also required. Costume changes can be rehearsed and done in as little as 30 seconds to 2 minutes (if a wig is involved).

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki
 |accessdate=2018-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/classics/resources/poetics/poettran.htm
 |title=Aristotle's Poetics, adapted from the translation by S.H. Butcher
 |accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

The '''''praetexta''''' or '''''fabula praetexta''''' was a genre of Latin [[tragedy]] introduced at Rome by [[Gnaeus Naevius]] in the third century B.C. It dealt with historical Roman figures, in place of the conventional [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]. Subsequent writers of ''praetextae'' included [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]]. The name refers to the ''toga praetexta'', the official dress of Roman magistrates.

All [[Roman Republic]]an tragedies are now lost. From the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] only one play has survived, the [[Octavia (play)|''Octavia'']].

'''''Scooby-Doo''''' is an American [[animation|animated]] [[Media franchise|franchise]], comprising many animated television series produced from 1969 to the present day. Writers [[Joe Ruby]] and [[Ken Spears]]  created the original series, ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', for [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in 1969. This [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] series featured four teenagers—[[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], [[Daphne Blake]], [[Velma Dinkley]], and [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville "Shaggy" Rogers]]—and their talking brown [[Great Dane]]&lt;ref name="STUEP1"/&gt; named [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], who solve mysteries involving supposedly [[supernatural]] creatures through a series of antics and missteps.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the original series, Hanna-Barbera and its successor [[Warner Bros. Animation]] have produced numerous follow-up and [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] animated series and several related works, including television specials and made-for-TV movies, a line of [[direct-to-video]] films, and two [[Warner Bros.]]–produced theatrical feature films. Some versions of ''Scooby-Doo'' feature different variations on the show's supernatural theme, and include characters such as Scooby's cousin [[Scooby-Dum]] and nephew [[Scrappy-Doo]] in addition to or instead of some of the original characters.

''Scooby-Doo'' was originally broadcast on [[CBS]] from 1969 to 1975, when it moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. ABC aired the show until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', from 1988 until 1991. New ''Scooby-Doo'' series aired as part of [[Kids' WB]] on [[The WB]] Network and its successor, [[The CW]] Network, from 2002 until 2008. ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' aired on [[Cartoon Network]] from 2010 to 2013,&lt;ref name="incpremiere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/scooby-doo-mystery-incorporated/305448|title=Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated on Cartoon Network|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=August 11, 2012}} {{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/tv/overview?q=Scooby-Doo!+Mystery+Incorporated&amp;seriesid=A236C83AB89142D1A61CF258F6022669|title=Scooby-Doo!

In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Scooby-Doo'' the fifth greatest TV cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|work=TV Guide|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In 1968, [[consumer organization|parent-run organizations]], particularly [[Action for Children's Television]] (ACT), began protesting what they perceived as excessive violence in Saturday-morning cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= William |last= Richter |title= Action for Children's Television|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021016074041/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/actionforch/actionforch.htm| archivedate= October 16, 2002| url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/actionforch/actionforch.htm| website= museum.tv| publisher= Museum of Broadcast Communications| accessdate= June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these shows were [[Hanna-Barbera]] action cartoons such as ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'', ''[[The Herculoids]]'' and ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollis|first1=Tim|title=Hi there, boys and girls! : America's local children's TV shows|date=2001|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=1578063965|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of these watchgroups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that new programs would be safe for children.

[[Fred Silverman]], executive for [[Daytime television in the United States|daytime programming]] at [[CBS]], was then looking for a show that would both revitalize his Saturday-morning line and please the watch groups. The result was ''[[The Archie Show]]'', based on [[Bob Montana]]'s teenage humor comic book ''[[Archie (comic book)|Archie]]''. Also successful were the musical numbers [[The Archies]] performed during each program (one of which, "[[Sugar, Sugar]]", was the most successful ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|number-one hit]] of 1969). Eager to build upon this success, Silverman contacted producers [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] about creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this time featuring teens who solved mysteries between gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular ''[[I Love a Mystery]]'' [[old-time radio|radio]] [[radio drama|serials]] of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Marcus &amp; Stephen R. Hulce (October 2000). "[http://www.Televisionheaven.co.uk/scooby.htm Scooby Doo, Where Are You]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128110448/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/scooby.htm |date=January 28, 2013 }}". ''Television Heaven''. Retrieved on June 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After attempting to develop his own version of the show, called ''House of Mystery'',&lt;ref name="STUEP1" /&gt; Barbera, who developed and sold Hanna-Barbera shows while Hanna produced them,&lt;ref name="STUEP1" /&gt; passed the task along to storywriters [[Joe Ruby]] and [[Ken Spears]], as well as artist/character designer [[Iwao Takamoto]]. Their treatment, based in part on ''The Archie Show'', was titled ''Mysteries Five'' and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, and Linda's brother W.W., along with their [[bongo drum|bongo]]-playing dog, Too Much, who collectively formed the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, [[zombie]]s, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty one.&lt;ref name="STUEP1" /&gt; When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a [[Great Dane]] but revised the dog character to a large [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, [[Hot Dog (comics)|Hot Dog]]) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character [[Marmaduke]].&lt;ref name="STUEP1" /&gt; Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.&lt;ref name="STUEP1"&gt;Shostak, Stu (February 5, 2012).

Retrieved March 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RubyAndSpears"&gt;Ruby and Spears (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the design phase, lead character designer Takamoto consulted a studio colleague who was a [[dog breeding|breeder]] of Great Danes. After learning the characteristics of a prize-winning Great Dane from her, Takamoto proceeded to break most of the rules and designed Too Much with overly bowed legs, a [[double chin]], and a sloped back, among other abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Ignacio| first=Cynthia Quimpo |year= 2002| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071003000331/http://www.yolk.com/v093/iwao1.html |url= http://www.yolk.com/v093/iwao1.html| title= Iwao Takamoto: Scooby-Doo and Iawo, Too| archivedate= October 3, 2007| work= Yolk 2.0.| volume= 9| number= 3| location= Los Angeles| publisher= Informasian Media Group, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview| year= 2006| first=Iwao |last=Takamoto| title= Eerie Mystery of Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt's History''  [documentary featurette]'' |work=[[The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour]]: The Complete Series | location= New York, Los Angeles| publisher= Warner Bros.

So, she came over, and spent a solid hour describing all of the positive things that makes a prize-winning Great Dane. And I selected about five things, I think, and went in the opposite direction.

Ruby and Spears' second pass at the show used ''Dobie Gillis'' as the template for the teenagers rather than ''Archie''. The treatment retained the dog Too Much, while reducing the number of teenagers to four, removing the Mike character and retaining Geoff, Kelly, Linda, and W.W.&lt;ref name="RubyAndSpears" /&gt; As their personalities were modified, so were the characters' names: Geoff became "Ronnie"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1969|title=Original storyboards|work=Scooby-Doo, Where are You!|location=Los Angeles|publisher=Hanna-Barbera Productions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990427022739/http://cartoonnetwork.com/doc/scooby/sdsb.html|url=http://cartoonnetwork.com/doc/scooby/sdsb.html|archivedate=April 27, 1999|postscript=.

The revised show was re-pitched to Silverman, who liked the material but, disliking the title ''Mysteries Five'', decided to call the show ''Who's S-S-Scared?''&lt;ref name=fsilvermanvideo/&gt; Silverman presented ''Who's S-S-Scared?'' to the CBS executives as the centerpiece for the upcoming [[1969–70 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)|1969–70 season]]'s Saturday morning cartoon block. CBS president [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]] felt that the presentation artwork was too scary for young viewers and, thinking the show would be the same, decided to pass on it.&lt;ref name=RubyAndSpears/&gt;&lt;ref name=fsilvermanvideo&gt;{{cite video|first=Dan |last= Pasternack|title=Interview with Fred Silverman|medium= Digital| publisher=[[Archive of American Television]]|date=2001|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/fred-silverman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now without a centerpiece for the upcoming season's programming, Silverman had Ruby, Spears, and the Hanna-Barbera staff revise the treatments and presentation materials to tone down the show and better reflect its comedy elements. The rock band element was dropped, and more attention was focused upon Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by [[Frank Sinatra]]'s [[scat singing|scat]] "doo-be-doo-be-doo" at the end of his recording of "[[Strangers in the Night]]" on a flight to one of the development meetings, and decided to rename the dog "[[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]" and re-rechristen the show ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]''&lt;ref name=RubyAndSpears/&gt; The revised show was re-presented to CBS executives, who approved it for production.

==Original television series run==

===CBS years (1969–75)===
[[File:Scooby-doo-meddling-kids-1970.jpg|right|thumb|Every episode of the original ''Scooby-Doo'' format contains a penultimate scene in which the kids unmask the ghost-of-the-week to reveal a real person in a costume, as in this scene from "Nowhere to Hyde", an episode of ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' originally aired on September 12, 1970.]]

====''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!''====
The first episode of ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' "What a Night for a Knight" debuted on the CBS network Saturday, September 13, 1969. The original [[voice acting|voice cast]] featured veteran voice actor [[Don Messick]] as Scooby-Doo, radio DJ [[Casey Kasem]] (later host of radio's syndicated ''[[American Top 40]]'') as Shaggy, actor [[Frank Welker]] (later a veteran voice actor in his own right) as Fred, actress [[Nicole Jaffe]] as Velma, and musician [[Indira Stefanianna|Indira Stefanianna Christopherson]] as Daphne.&lt;ref&gt;(2008). "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063950/fullcredits Full cast and credits for ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'']''IMDb.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Scooby's speech patterns closely resembled an earlier cartoon dog, [[Astro (The Jetsons)|Astro]] from ''[[The Jetsons]]'' (1962–63), also voiced by Messick.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Seventeen episodes of ''Scooby-Doo Where are You!'' were produced in 1969–70. The series theme song was written by David Mook and Ben Raleigh, and performed by Larry Marks.

Each of these episodes features Scooby and the four teenage members of Mystery, Inc.—[[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]], [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] and [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]]—arriving at a location in the Mystery Machine, a van painted with [[psychedelic color]]s and [[flower power]] imagery. Encountering a ghost, monster, or other ostensibly supernatural creature terrorizing the local populace, they decide to investigate. The kids split up to look for clues and suspects while being chased at turns by the monster. Eventually, the kids come to realize the ghost and other paranormal activity is actually an elaborate hoax, and—often with the help of a [[Rube Goldberg]]-like trap designed by Fred—they capture the villain and unmask him. Revealed as a flesh and blood crook trying to cover up crimes by using the ghost story and costume, the criminal is arrested and taken to jail, often repeating something nearly identical to "... and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!"

Scheduled opposite another teenage mystery-solving show, ABC's ''[[The Hardy Boys (1969 TV series)|The Hardy Boys]]'', ''Scooby-Doo'' became a ratings success, with [[Nielsen ratings]] reporting that as many as 65% of Saturday morning audiences were tuned in to CBS when ''Scooby-Doo'' was being broadcast.&lt;ref name="STUEP1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=RubyAndSpears /&gt; The show was renewed for a second season in 1970, for which eight episodes were produced. Seven of the second-season episodes featured chase sequences set to [[bubblegum pop]] songs recorded by [[Austin Roberts (singer)|Austin Roberts]],&lt;ref&gt;(1002)''Europa International Who's Who in Popular Music''East Sussex, United Kingdom: Psychology Press. Pg. 424&lt;/ref&gt; who also re-recorded the theme song for this season. With Stefanianna Christopherson having married and retired from voice acting, [[Heather North]] assumed the role of Daphne, and would continue to voice the character until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;(2001).  Interview with Heather North and Nicole Jaffe. ''In Their Own Words'' [documentary featurette from ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomut Hour: The Complete Series'' DVD bonus features].  New York, Los Angeles, CA: Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV influences of ''I Love a Mystery'' and ''Dobie Gillis'' were apparent in the first episodes. Of the similarities between the ''Scooby-Doo'' teens and the ''Dobie Gillis'' teens, the similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same [[beatnik]]-style [[goatee]], similar hairstyles, and demeanors.&lt;ref name="STUEP1" /&gt; The core premise of ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' was also similar to [[Enid Blyton]]'s ''[[The Famous Five (novel series)|Famous Five]]'' books. Both series featured four youths with a dog, and the Famous Five stories would often revolve around a mystery which would invariably turn out not to be supernaturally based, but simply a ruse to [[disguise]] the villain's true intent.

The role of each character was strongly defined in the series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a [[Bob Hope]]-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery.&lt;ref name=RubyAndSpears/&gt; Later versions of the show would make slight changes to the characters' established roles, most notably in the character of Daphne, shown in 1990s and 2000s ''Scooby-Doo'' productions as knowing many forms of [[karate]] and having the ability to defend herself, and less of a tendency towards getting kidnapped.

''Scooby-Doo'' itself would be an influence on many other Saturday morning [[cartoon]]s of the 1970s. During that decade, Hanna-Barbera and its competitors produced several animated programs also featuring teenage detectives solving mysteries with a pet or mascot of some sort, including ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' (1970–71), ''[[The Funky Phantom]]'' (1971–72), ''[[The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan]]'' (1972–73), ''[[Speed Buggy]]'' (1973–74), ''[[Goober and the Ghost Chasers]]'' (1973–74), ''[[Jabberjaw]]'' (1976–78), ''[[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels]]'' (1977–80), among others.&lt;ref name="Burke and Burke-p105-119"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38832996 |title=Saturday Morning Fever |last=1964– |first=Burke, Timothy, |date=1999 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=0312169965 |edition= 1st St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |pages=105–119 |oclc=38832996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The New Scooby-Doo Movies''====
In 1972, new one-hour episodes under the title ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' were created; each episode featuring a real or fictitious guest star helping the gang solve mysteries, including characters from other Hanna-Barbera series such as ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' and ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', the comic book characters [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (later adapted into their own Hanna-Barbera series, ''[[Super Friends]]'', a year later), and celebrities such as [[Sandy Duncan]], [[The Addams Family]], [[Cass Elliot]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Don Knotts]] and [[The Three Stooges]]. Hanna-Barbera musical director [[Hoyt Curtin]] composed a new theme song for this series, and Curtin's theme would remain in use for much of ''Scooby-Doo's'' original broadcast run. After two seasons and 24 episodes of the ''New Movies'' format from 1972 to 1974, CBS began airing reruns of the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' series until its option on the series ran out in 1976.&lt;ref name="STUEP1"/&gt;

===ABC years (1976–91)===

====''The Scooby-Doo Show'' and ''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics''====
Now president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], Fred Silverman made a deal with Hanna-Barbera to bring new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' to the ABC Saturday morning lineup, where the show went through almost yearly lineup changes. For their [[1976–77 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)|1976–77 season]], 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo were joined with a new Hanna-Barbera show, ''[[Dynomutt, Dog Wonder]]'', to create ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour]]'' (the show became ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show'' when a bonus ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' rerun was added to the package in November 1976). Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, now working for Silverman as supervisors of the ABC Saturday morning programs, returned the program to its original ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' format, with the addition of Scooby's dim-witted country cousin [[Scooby-Dum]], voiced by [[Daws Butler]], as a recurring character.&lt;ref name="STUEP1" /&gt; The voice cast was held over from ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' save for Nicole Jaffe, who retired from acting in 1973. [[Pat Stevens]] took over her role as the voice of Velma.

For the [[1977–78 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)|1977–78 season]], ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show'' became the two-hour programming block ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' ([[1977–78 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)|1977–78]]) with the addition of ''[[Laff-a-Lympics]]'' and ''[[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels]]''. In addition to eight new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' and reruns of the 1969 show, Scooby-Doo also appeared during the ''All-Star'' block's ''Laff-a-Lympics'' series, which featured 45 Hanna-Barbera characters competing in ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''-esque parodies of [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic]] sporting events. Scooby was seen as the team captain of the ''Laff-a-Lympics'' "Scooby Doobies" team, which also featured Shaggy and Scooby-Dum among its members.

''Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics'' was retitled ''Scooby's All Stars'' for the [[1978-79 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)|1978–79 season]], reduced to 90 minutes when ''Dynomutt'' was spun off into its own half-hour and the 1969 reruns were dropped. ''Scooby's All-Stars'' continued broadcasting reruns of ''Scooby-Doo'' from 1976 and 1977, while new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' aired during a separate half-hour under the ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' banner. After nine weeks, the separate ''Where are You!'' broadcast was cancelled, and the remainder of the 16 new 1978 episodes debuted during the ''Scooby's All-Stars'' block.&lt;ref&gt;Lenberg, Jeff (2006). ''The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons''. New York: Facts of File. {{ISBN|0-8160-6599-3}} p. 618–619.&lt;/ref&gt; The 40 total ''Scooby-Doo'' episodes produced from 1976 to 1978 were later packaged together for [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] as ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'', under which title they continue to air.

====''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo''====
The ''Scooby-Doo'' characters first appeared outside of their regular Saturday morning format in ''[[Scooby Goes Hollywood]]'', an hour-long ABC [[television special]] aired in [[prime time]] on December 13, 1979. The special revolved around Shaggy and Scooby attempting to convince the network to move Scooby out of Saturday morning and into a prime-time series, and featured spoofs of then-current television series and films such as ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'' and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.

In 1979, Scooby's tiny nephew [[Scrappy-Doo]] was added to both the series and the billing, in an attempt to boost ''Scooby-Doo''{{'}}s slipping [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].&lt;ref name="ScrappyDays" /&gt; The [[1979-80 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)|1979–80]] episodes, aired under the new title ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' as an independent half-hour show, succeeded in regenerating interest in the show. [[Lennie Weinrib]] voiced Scrappy in the 1979–80 episodes, with Don Messick assuming the role thereafter.&lt;ref name="ScrappyDays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/writings/scrappy-days/|title=Scrappy Days: The Birth of Scrappy-Doo and What I Had to Do with It|first=Mark|last=Evanier|authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=Newsfromme.com|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marla Frumkin replaced Pat Stevens as the voice of Velma mid-season.

====''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' shorts====
As a result of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's'' success, the entire show was overhauled in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the [[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (shorts)|new ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' format]] now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute ''Scooby and Scrappy'' cartoons, who in previous ''Scooby'' series had been revealed to be human criminals in [[costume]], were now real within the context of the series.

This version of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' first aired from 1980 to 1982 as part of ''[[The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show]]'', an hour-long program also featuring episodes of Hanna-Barbera's new ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'' cartoon, adapted from the [[Harvey Comics]] character. From 1982 to 1983, ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' were part of ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour]]'', a co-production with [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] which featured two ''Scooby and Scrappy'' shorts, a ''Scrappy and Yabba-Doo'' short featuring Scrappy-Doo and his [[Western (genre)|Western]] deputy uncle Yabba-Doo, and ''[[The Puppy's New Adventures]]'', based on characters from a 1977 Ruby-Spears TV special.

Beginning in 1980, a half-hour of reruns from previous incarnations of ''Scooby-Doo'' were broadcast on ABC Saturday mornings in addition to first-run episodes. Airing under the titles ''Scooby-Doo Classics'', ''[[Scary Scooby Funnies]]'', ''The Best of Scooby-Doo'', and ''[[Scooby's Mystery Funhouse]]'', the rerun package remained on the air until the end of the 1986 season.&lt;ref name="McNeil3"&gt;McNeil, Alex (1996). ''Total Television'' (4th ed.), pg. 732. New York: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-024916-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show''====
''Scooby-Doo'' was restored to a standalone half-hour in 1983 with ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'' in 1983, which comprised two 11-minute mysteries per episode in a format reminiscent of the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' mysteries. Heather North returned to the voice cast as Daphne, who in this incarnation solved mysteries with Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy while working undercover as a reporter for a teen magazine.

This version of the show lasted for two seasons, with the second season airing under the title ''The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries''. The 1984–85 season episodes featured semi-regular appearances from Fred and Velma, with Frank Welker and Marla Frumkin resuming their respective roles for these episodes.

====''The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo''====
1985 saw the debut of ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', which featured Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and new characters Flim-Flam (voiced by [[Susan Blu]])&lt;ref name="TRueggerInterview"/&gt; and Vincent Van Ghoul (based upon and voiced by [[Vincent Price]]) traveling the globe to capture "thirteen of the most terrifying ghosts upon the face of the earth." The final first-run episode of ''The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo'' aired in December 1985, and after its reruns were removed from the ABC lineup the following March, no new ''Scooby'' series aired on the network for the next two years.

====''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo''====
Hanna-Barbera reincarnated the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' cast as [[elementary school]] students (a common trope in 1980s children's TV) for a new series titled ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', which debuted on ABC in 1988. ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' was an irreverent re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of [[Tex Avery]] and [[Bob Clampett]], and eschewed the realistic aesthetic of the original ''Scooby'' series for a more ''[[Looney Tunes]]''-like style, including an episode where Scooby-Doo's parents show up and reveal his real name to be "Scoobert". At the same time, the series returned to its original formula in that the group unmasked human villains in costume, as opposed to the supernatural monsters of the early to mid-1980s. The series also established "Coolsville" as the name of the gang's hometown; this setting was retained for several of the later ''Scooby'' productions. The retooled show was a success, remaining in production for four seasons and on ABC's lineup until 1991.

''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' was developed and produced by [[Tom Ruegger]], who had been the head [[story editor]] on ''Scooby-Doo'' since 1983. Following the first season of ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'', Ruegger and much of his unit defected from Hanna-Barbera to [[Warner Bros. Animation]] to develop ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures|Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' and later ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', and ''[[Freakazoid!]]''.&lt;ref name="TRueggerInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html|title=Tom Ruegger is back!|publisher=Platypuscomix.net|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reruns and reboots (1987–present)==

===TV movies, reruns, and direct-to-video films===
From 1987 to 1988, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'', a series of [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[Television film|TV movies]] featuring their most popular characters, including [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[The Flintstones]] and [[The Jetsons]]. Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy starred in three of these movies: ''[[Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers]]'' (1987), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'' (1988), and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf]]'' (1988). These three films took their tone from the early-1980s ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' entries, and featured the characters encountering actual monsters and ghosts rather than masqueraded people. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy later appeared as the narrators of the made-for-TV movie ''[[Scooby-Doo in Arabian Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', originally broadcast by [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] in 1994, [[Don Messick]]'s final outing as the original voice of Scooby-Doo.

Reruns of ''Scooby-Doo'' have been in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] since 1980, and have also been shown on [[cable television]] networks such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS Superstation]] (until 1989) and [[USA Network]] (as part of the [[USA Cartoon Express]] from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'', having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With [[Turner Broadcasting]] purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and [[Turner Network Television|TNT]].&lt;ref name="STUEP10" /&gt; [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] network [[TELETOON (Canada)|Teletoon]] began airing ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' in 1997, with the other ''Scooby'' series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, ''Scooby-Doo'' became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]].

With ''Scooby-Doo's'' restored popularity in reruns on Cartoon Network,&lt;ref name="STUEP10"&gt;Shostak, Stu (December 3, 2014). "[http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php Interview with Jerry Beck]".

[[Jerry Beck]] and host Stu Shostak discuss the early history of Cartoon Network and the Turner-run version of Hanna-Barbera when discussing the career for former CN executive Stu Snyder.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and Hanna-Barbera (by then a subsidiary of [[Warner Bros.]] following the merger of [[Time Warner]] and Turner Entertainment in 1996) began producing one new ''Scooby-Doo'' direct-to-video movie a year beginning in 1998.&lt;ref name="STUEP10" /&gt; These movies featured a slightly older version of the original five-character cast from the ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' days. The first four DTV entries were ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'' (1998), ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]]'' (1999), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'' (2000), and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'' (2001). Frank Welker was the only original voice cast member to return for these productions. Don Messick had died in 1997 and Casey Kasem, a strict vegetarian, relinquished the role of Shaggy after having to provide the voice for a 1995 [[Burger King]] commercial.&lt;ref name="KasemVegetarian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1908941,00.html|work=Time|title=Radio Host Casey Kasem|first=Laura|last=Fitzpatrick|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[Scott Innes]] took over as both Scooby-Doo and Shaggy ([[Billy West]] voiced Shaggy in ''Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island''). [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]] took over as Velma, and [[Mary Kay Bergman]] voiced Daphne until her death in November 1999, and was replaced by [[Grey DeLisle]].

These first four direct-to-video films differed from the original series format by placing the characters in plots with a darker tone and pitting them against actual supernatural forces. ''Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island'', featured the original 1969 gang, reunited after years of being apart, fighting [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]]-worshiping cat creatures in the [[Louisiana]] bayou. ''Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost'' featured an author (voice of [[Tim Curry]]) returning to his hometown with the gang, to find out that an event is being haunted by the author's dead ancestor Sarah, who was an actual witch. ''The Witch's Ghost'' introduced a [[goth rock]] band known as The Hex Girls, who became recurring characters in the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise.

''Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase'' was the final production made by the Hanna-Barbera studio, which was absorbed into parent company [[Warner Bros. Animation]] following William Hanna's death in 2001. Warner Animation would continue production of the direct-to-video series while also producing new ''Scooby-Doo'' series for television.

The direct-to-video productions continued to be produced concurrently with at least one entry per year. Two of these entries, ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico]]'' (both 2003) were produced in a retro-style reminiscent of the original series, and featured Heather North and Nicole Jaffe as the voices of Daphne and Velma, respectively. Later entries produced between 2004 and 2009 were done in the style of ''What's New, Scooby-Doo'', using that show's voice cast. Entries from 2010 on use the original 1969 designs and feature [[Matthew Lillard]] as the voice of Shaggy, the character Lillard portrayed in the live-action theatrical ''Scooby-Doo'' films. Two Scooby-Doo! movies were released in 2016, named ''[[Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon]]''.

In addition, a live-action TV movie, ''[[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins]]'', was released on DVD and simultaneously aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the series' debut.&lt;ref&gt;Scooby-Doo: No Big Mystery, Third Live-Action Movie in the Works ''TVSeriesFinale.com''.

===Kids' WB years (2002–08)===

====''What's New, Scooby-Doo?''====
In 2002, following the successes of the Cartoon Network reruns, the direct to video franchise, and the first feature film, ''Scooby-Doo'' returned to Saturday morning for the first time in 17 years with ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'', which aired on [[Kids' WB]] from 2002 until 2006. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, the show follows the format of the original series but places it in the 21st century, featuring a heavy promotion of modern technology (computers, DVD, the Internet, cell phones) and culture.

Beginning with this series, Frank Welker took over as Scooby's voice actor, while continuing to provide the voice of Fred as well. Casey Kasem returned as Shaggy, on the condition that the character be depicted as a vegetarian like Kasem himself.&lt;ref name="KasemVegetarian" /&gt; Grey DeLisle continued to voice Daphne, and former ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|Facts of Life]]'' star [[Mindy Cohn]] voiced Velma. The series was produced by [[Chuck Sheetz]], who had worked on ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

====''Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!''====
After three seasons, ''What's New, Scooby-Doo'' was replaced in September 2006 with ''[[Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!]]'', a major revamping of the series which debuted on [[The CW]]'s Kids' WB Saturday morning programming block. In the new premise, Shaggy inherits money and a [[mansion]] from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention. The villains, led by "Dr. Phibes" (based primarily upon [[Dr. Evil]] from the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] ''series, and named after Vincent Price's character from ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]''), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series. [[Scott Menville]] voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert. ''Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!'' ran for two seasons on The CW.

===Cartoon Network and Boomerang years (2010–present)===

====''Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated''====
The next ''Scooby'' series, ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'', premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on April 5, 2010.&lt;ref name="incpremiere"/&gt; The first ''Scooby'' series produced for cable television, ''Mystery Incorporated'' is a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the franchise, re-establishing the characters' relationships, personalities, and locations, and expanding their world to feature their parents, high school, and neighbors. The series also borrowed pieces from many parts of ''Scooby-Doo's'' long history, as well as characters and elements of other Hanna-Barbera shows to form its back story and the bases of some of its episodes. Matthew Lillard was brought over from the direct-to-video series as the new voice of Shaggy, while Welker, Cohn, and DeLisle continued in their respective roles. [[Patrick Warburton]], [[Linda Cardellini]], [[Lewis Black]], [[Vivica A. Fox]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Udo Kier]], [[Tim Matheson]], [[Tia Carrere]], and [[Kate Higgins]] were added as new semi-regular cast members. Casey Kasem appeared in a recurring role as Shaggy's father, one of his last roles before retiring due to declining health.

The series, while still following the basic mystery-solving format of its predecessors, was broadcast as a 52-chapter animated [[telenovela|televised novel]] and included elements similar to live-action mystery/adventure shows such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/scoobydoo-mystery-incorporated-through-the-curtain,96153/|title=Review: Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated – "Through the Curtain"/"Come Undone"|publisher=[[The A.V.

The comic books later moved to all-original stories until ending with issue #30 in 1974. Several of these issues were written by [[Mark Evanier]] and drawn by [[Dan Spiegle]].&lt;ref name="ScrappyDays" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScoobyComics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2010/08/17/another-story-you-wont-believe/|title=Another Story You Won't Believe|first=Mark|last=Evanier|authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=Newsfromme.com|date=August 17, 2010|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]] published ''Scooby'' comics, many drawn by Bill Williams, for 11 issues in 1975.

In 2001, ''Scooby-Doo in Stagefright'', a live stage play based upon the series, began touring across the world. A follow-up, ''Scooby-Doo and the Pirate Ghost'', followed in 2009.

The Mystery Machine has been used as the basis for many die-cast models and toys, such as from [[hotwheels]].

During its four decade broadcast history, ''Scooby-Doo'' has received two [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations: a 1989 [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]] nomination for ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', and a 2003 Daytime Emmy nomination for ''What's New, Scooby-Doo''{{'}}s Mindy Cohn in the "Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program" category.&lt;ref name="awards at IMDB"&gt;{{cite web|title="Awards for ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?''" |website=''IMDb.com'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306274/awards|date=August 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Science advocate [[Carl Sagan]] favorably compared the predominantly skeptic oriented formula to that of most television dealing with paranormal themes, and considered that an adult analogue to ''Scooby-Doo'' would be a great public service.&lt;ref name="Sagan"&gt;Sagan, Carl.

''Scooby-Doo'' has maintained a significant fan base, which has grown steadily since the 1990s due to the show's popularity among both young children and nostalgic adults who grew up with the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/s/scooby-doo.html |title=Review: Scooby-Doo 2002 (Archive) |publisher=Colossus.net |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719044530/http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/s/scooby-doo.html |archivedate=July 19, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several television critics have stated that the show's mix of the comedy-adventure and horror genres was the reason for its widespread success.&lt;ref name="Elias"&gt;Elias, Justine (February 24, 2002).

''The New York Times''. Excerpt: "Both the [Cartoon Network] and children's TV critics point to ''Scooby's'' mix of thrills, gas and reassurance as the key to its longevity."&lt;/ref&gt; As Fred Silverman and the Hanna-Barbera staff had planned when they first began producing the series, ''Scooby-Doo''{{'}}s ghosts, monsters and spooky locales tend more towards humor than horror, making them easily accessible to younger children. "Overall, [''Scooby-Doo'' is] just not a show that is going to overstimulate kids' emotions and tensions," offered American Center for Children and Media executive director David Kleeman in a 2002 interview.

==Pop culture==
As with most popular franchises, ''Scooby-Doo'' has been parodied and has done parodies.
* The [[Cult following|cult television]] and comic book series ''[[Buffyverse|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] ''features a group of characters that refer to themselves as the "[[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]]", who similarly battle supernatural forces and solve supernatural monster mysteries. The show contains obvious influences of ''Scooby-Doo'', where "The Scoobies" use books to look up monsters. [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], the actress who plays [[Buffy Summers]] on the series, later went on to appear as [[Daphne Blake]] in the live-action films ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]''.
* Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Inc. gang (based on their classic 1972 incarnation as opposed to their more recent incarnations) appear in the second part of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases" in which they team up with Batman and Robin to rescue [["Weird Al" Yankovic|Weird Al]] who was kidnapped by [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] and [[Penguin (character)|The Penguin]].
* ''Scooby-Doo and the Snowmen Mystery'', vinyl LP released 1972 in the United Kingdom, Stereo, 33 ⅓ RPM, LP, from the label [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]] – MFP 50086.
* The film ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' includes an alternate ending called the "Scooby-Doo Ending" in which a character in the film is revealed to have been wearing a mask. It also includes a reference to the iconic line "Let's see who this really is" before removing the mask.
* ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' has a brief scene where the title characters hitch a ride in the Mystery Machine with Scooby and the gang.
* The [[Filk music|filk]] band [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]] open their 2003 album ''Oh Okay LA'' with the song "W.W.S.D.?" ("What Would Scooby Do?"), which proposes a [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] system of [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] based on the actions of Scooby-Doo.
* In October 1999, [[Cartoon Network]] made a Scooby-Doo spoof of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' called ''The Scooby-Doo Project''.
* A ''Scooby-Doo'' parody has appeared in the ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' episode "Kitchen Nightmares Before Christmas / How I Met Your Mummy".
* ''Scooby-Doo'' has been parodied on ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "Saturday Morning Fun Pit", where the characters from Planet Express take on the roles of the gang (Bender as Scooby, Hermes as Fred, Leela as Daphne, Amy as Velma and Fry as Shaggy).
* The ''[[The Venture Bros.|Venture Bros.]]'' episode "¡Viva los Muertos!" features a thinly parodied version of the gang as aging, gone-to-seed miscreants with the characters matched to corresponding serial killers and radical figures, e.g. Fred being mixed with [[Ted Bundy]] into the composite character "Ted".
* The series is parodied in the animated music video for the song "[[Ghost (Mystery Skulls song)|Ghost]]" by [[Mystery Skulls]].
* The [[animated series]] ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' has a parody of Scooby-Doo called "[[List of Arthur characters|Spooky-Poo]]".
* In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]", the nu metal band [[Korn]], parodying Scooby and the gang, tackle an invasion of mysterious "Pirate Ghosts". They enlist the help of [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick]], and after they solve the mystery they perform "[[Falling Away from Me]]" from their album ''[[Issues (Korn album)|Issues]]''.
* ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' defends the gang against possession charges in the 2002 episode "Shaggy Busted".
* In the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode "The Cruel Giggling Ghoul", each Titan assumes the role of a Scooby Gang member (with [[Beast Boy]] as Scooby) to investigate a mystery at a spooky amusement park, with the help of [[LeBron James]].
* The novel ''Meddling Kids'' (2017) by [[Edgar Cantero]] parodies not only ''Scooby-Doo''—starting with taking the title on the show's catchphrase—but also books by [[Enid Blyton]], the [[Hardy Boys]], [[Nancy Drew]] and teen-detective dramas in general.
* The CW's television series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' crossed over with the Scooby-Doo franchise in the episode ''[[Scoobynatural]]'', which aired March 29, 2018. The animated collaboration featured the three main characters of ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' (Sam, Dean, and Castiel) along with Scooby and the gang as they team up to solve a supernatural mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/supernatural-scooby-doo-scoobynatural-jensen-ackles-jared-padalecki-interview-1202732177/|title=How ‘Supernatural’s’ ‘Scooby-Doo’ Crossover Came To Be|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|date=2018-03-21|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The five girl ghouls from ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'' made a return in the ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'' episode "Monster Party", which was first released online on October 1, 2018, and aired on television October 21, 2018. Though Scooby and Shaggy do not appear, they are briefly referenced. While Taylor, Blu and Musick reprise their roles, [[Natalie Palamides]] and [[Kristen Li]] took over for Winnie and Tanis, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2683">A '''script coordinator''' is a role in the production of a [[film]] or [[television program|television series]]. The script coordinator is responsible for producing each [[draft document|draft]] of the [[screenplay|script]] and annotating it for ease of use for the production team.

On a television series the script coordinator is responsible for liaising between the writing and [[Film_production#Production|production]] departments. The writers deliver the first [[draft document|draft]] of a [[screenplay|script]] to the script coordinator who prepares it for the production team and handles any clearance issues. Clearance refers to the need to check the [[screenplay|script]] for potential legal problems and ensure that all names are cleared by the legal department. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-script-coordinator-do.htm wisegeek.com, What Does a Script Coordinator Do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The script coordinator must check the [[draft document|draft]] for proper formatting, spelling, punctuation and continuity before releasing the [[draft document|draft]]. Once a [[screenplay|script]] has been released, other members of the production team offer notes to the writers necessitating revisions to the [[screenplay|script]]. The process of how widely each [[draft document|draft]] is released (e.g. just to the writers, then to the writers and producers and then to the network) varies from show to show. &lt;ref&gt;[http://aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com/2012/07/5-questions-with-writers-assistant-and.html aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com, 5 Questions with a Writer's Assistant and Script Coordinator, Tuesday, July 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

With each round of revisions the script coordinator must ensure that the changes are clearly marked, re-issue the [[screenplay|script]] and again check the [[screenplay|script]] for errors. Many script coordinators are also responsible for foreign language translations and compiling a [[Bible (writing)|show bible]] that tracks plot points and character introductions as a reference tool. 

A script coordinator is a distinct role from [[script supervisor]]. A script supervisor is responsible for on-set annotation of the [[screenplay|script]] for editing purposes rather than [[pre-production]] coordination of the [[screenplay|script]] to facilitate production. A script coordinator is considered a junior role in the writing staff and becoming a full-time [[screenwriter]] is typically a common promotion from being a script coordinator.

'''Soft media''' is defined as those organizations that primarily deal with commentary, [[entertainment]], arts and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].  Soft media can take the form of [[television program]]s, magazines or print articles. The communication from soft media sources has been referred to as soft news.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sex, Lies, and War: How Soft News Brings Foreign Policy to the Inattentive Public, Matthew A. Baum&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft news is defined as information that is primarily entertaining or personally useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A New Standard of News Quality: Burglar Alarms for the Monitorial Citizen|last = Zaller|first = John|date = 2003|journal = Political Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft news is often compared to [[hard news]], which John Zaller defines as the "coverage of breaking events involving top leaders, major issues, or significant disruptions in the routines of daily life." While the purposes of both hard and soft news include informing the public, the two differ from one another in both the information contained within them and the methods that are used to present that information. Communicated through forms of soft media, soft news is usually contained in outlets that primarily serve as sources of entertainment, such as television programs, magazines, or print articles.

==Background==
There are many terms that can be associated with soft media, among them are soft news and [[infotainment]].  These are, in large part, the byproducts of soft media.  A fundamental role of the media, either hard or soft, is to inform the public.&lt;ref&gt;Soft News Goes to War: Public Opinion and American Foreign Policy in the New Media Age, Matthew A. Baum&lt;/ref&gt;  While the role of [[Media (communication)|media]] is not in flux, the form is.  For many Americans the lines are becoming blurred between hard and soft media as news organizations are blending their broadcasts with news shows and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Reinemann, C., Stanyer, J., Scherr, S., &amp; Legnante, G. (2012). Hard and soft news: A review of concepts, operationalizations and key findings. Journalism, 13(2), 221-239. doi:10.1177/1464884911427803&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these [[news organizations]] create a narrative that begins with the first broadcast in the morning and end with the evening [[entertainment]] venue.&lt;ref&gt;From Hard to Soft News Standards?
How Political Journalists in Different Media Systems Evaluate the Shifting Quality of News,
Fritz Plasser&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2004 presidential campaign, magazines that would otherwise be considered lifestyle or entertainment (''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' and ''[[O: The Oprah Magazine]]'') became a source of political information.  This illustrates that media organizations across the spectrum are emerging as suppliers of information on [[policy]] and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Reaching Women: Soft Media in the 2004 Presidential Election, Diane J. Heith&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The average American [[TV consumption|consumes]] more than five hours of television per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/average-american-watches-5-hours-tv-day-article-1.1711954|title = Average American watches 5 hours of TV per day, report shows|last = Hinckley|first = David|date = March 5, 2014|work = |access-date = |via = New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, they are exposed to a variety of news and information that either directly (hard news) or indirectly (soft news) focuses on politics, foreign affairs, and policy. These topics are aired on [[prime-time]] television in a variety of programs especially in a time of national crises. Studies have shown that news presented in this context attracts the attention of otherwise politically uninvolved people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Overall more people tend to watch hard news than soft news shows. However, those who are less politically involved can gain more from watching soft news than those who are highly politically involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/mbaum/documents/SoftNewsAndPoliticalKnowledge.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown that exposure to soft news can affect [[consumer]]s' attitudes. Soft media has been shown to increase a candidate’s likability, which has a greater appeal to those people who are generally not politically involved than a candidate’s political policies do. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, researchers found politically uninvolved people who viewed candidates on daytime talk shows were likely to find those candidates more likable than their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of American Public Opinion and the Media|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Pt7abs5DxGcC|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 2013-05-23|isbn = 9780199673025|first = Robert Y.|last = Shapiro|first2 = Lawrence R.|last2 = Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that instead of using a candidate's political policy to determine whether or not the candidate represents their interests, non-politically involved people also use a candidate's likability.

A study conducted in Australia concluded hard news is more followed than soft news, except in the realm of sports. The study found that regardless of age and sex, soft news is less likely to be followed than hard news. With the lack in following for soft news, support for increased public engagement caused by soft news is rejected. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=An|date=2012-10-01|title=The Effect of Soft News on Public Attachment to the News|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2012.664318|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=13|issue=5-6|pages=706–717|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2012.664318|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study examining the effects of soft news consumption on voting behaviors, the phenomenon known as the [[The Oprah Effect|Oprah Effect]] was established, which indicated that the intake of soft news has a positive effect on patterns of voting consistency in people who are otherwise politically unaware.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Oprah Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently|last = Baum|first = Matthew A.|date = November 2006|journal = The Journal of Politics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Jamison|first2 = Angela S.|volume = 68|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, Baum and Jamison's study found that watching interviews of candidates on soft media helps improve voting consistency in otherwise politically uninformed people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4067">'''Sports entertainment''' is a type of [[spectacle]] which presents an ostensibly [[competition|competitive]] event using a high level of [[theatre|theatrical]] flourish and extravagant presentation, with the purpose of [[entertainment|entertaining]] an [[audience]]. Unlike typical [[sport]]s and games, which are conducted for [[competition]], [[sportsmanship]], [[physical exercise]] or personal [[recreation]], the primary product of sports entertainment is performance for an audience's benefit, thus they are never practiced privately. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; as this is an [[open secret]], it is not considered to be [[match fixing]].

==History==
The term "sports entertainment" was coined by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) chairman [[Vince McMahon]] during the 1980s as a [[List of marketing terms|marketing term]] to describe the industry of [[professional wrestling]], primarily to potential advertisers,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/stephanie-mcmahon-explains-sports-entertainment-was-created-advertisers&lt;/ref&gt; although precursors date back to February 1935, when ''[[Toronto Star]]'' sports editor [[Lou Marsh]] described professional wrestling as "sportive entertainment". In 1989 WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate for classifying professional wrestling as "sports entertainment" and thus not subject to regulation like a directly [[Sports competition|competitive sport]].

Some sports entertainment events represent variants of actual [[sport]]s, such as exhibition [[basketball]] with the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. Others modify sport for entertainment purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional [[wrestling]]), and more recently many of the various [[mascot race]]s held at numerous [[Major League Baseball]] games in-between innings.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of sports entertainment involve taking competitive games usually considered minor, such as [[dodgeball]], [[poker]], or [[rock-paper-scissors]], and televising them with trumped-up theatrics, involving (for example) [[celebrity]] competitors or elaborate audiovisual packages.

==Perceptions==
Sports entertainment has a stigma of being mindless pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake of entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro-fane|url=http://www.americanpopularculture.com/archive/tv/pro_wrestling.htm|work=Americana|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been criticized as such in popular media, often through lampooning.

Many notable names in the [[United States]] openly admit enjoying certain forms of sports entertainment while many others have taken part in it or made paid contributions. Professional [[basketball]] player [[Shaquille O'Neal]] has a reputation as a long time pro wrestling fan and attends [[WWE]] events several times per year, and [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] expressed interest in fulfilling a WWE career after he retires from professional [[boxing]]. Both worked [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] with [[Big Show]], Mayweather's culminating in a featured match at [[WrestleMania XXIV]]. Former [[American football]] player [[Brian Urlacher]] made an attempt to leave football to wrestle for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] full-time until his team at the time, the [[Chicago Bears]], forced him to stop. Mixed martial artists [[Brock Lesnar]], [[Bobby Lashley]] and [[Dan Severn]] have been booked as pro wrestling world heavyweight champions; [[David Arquette]] was briefly [[WCW World Heavyweight Champion]], as part of a [[Ready to Rumble|cross-promotional movie deal]].

'''Street performance''' or '''busking''' is the act of performing in public places for [[gratuity|gratuities]]. In many countries the rewards are generally in the form of money but other gratuities such as food, drink or gifts may be given. Street performance is practiced all over the world and dates back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. People engaging in this practice are called '''street performers''' or '''buskers'''.

Performances are anything that people find [[entertainment|entertaining]]. Performers may do [[acrobatics]], [[Animal training|animal tricks]], [[balloon modelling|balloon twisting]], [[caricature]]s, [[clown]]ing, comedy, [[contortion]]s, [[escapology]], dance, singing, [[Fire performance|fire skills]], [[flea circus]], [[fortune-telling]], [[juggling]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[living statue]], [[music]]al performance, [[puppeteer]]ing, [[snake charming]], [[storytelling]] or reciting poetry or [[prose]], [[street art]] such as [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]] and painting, [[street theatre]], [[sword swallowing]], and [[ventriloquism]].

== Etymology ==
The term ''busking'' was first noted in the English language around the middle 1860s in Great Britain. The verb ''to busk'', from the word ''busker'', comes from the Spanish root word ''buscar'', with the meaning "to seek".&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=busker "busker"] Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish word ''buscar'' in turn evolved from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word ''*bhudh-skō'' ("to win, conquer").&lt;ref name="Diccionario RAE"&gt;{{citation |url= http://dle.rae.es/?id=6LB1acb |title= buscar |work= Diccionario de la Lengua Española |edition=23rd |publisher= [[Real Academia Española]] |language= Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for many street acts, and title of a famous Spanish book about one of them, ''[[El Buscón]]''. Today, the word is still used in Spanish but mostly relegated for female street sex workers, or women seeking to be set up as private mistress of married men.

== History ==
There have been performances in public places for [[gratuities]] in every major culture in the world, dating back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. For many musicians street performance was the most common means of employment before the advent of [[sound recording|recording]] and personal electronics.&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;Baird, Stephen (2000).[http://www.buskersadvocates.org/saahistory.html#saafranklin "The History and Cultural Impact of Street Performing in America: Ben Franklin"]. Street Performers and Buskers Advocates. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, a person had to produce any music or entertainment, save for a few mechanical devices such as the [[barrel organ]], the [[music box]], and the [[piano roll]]. [[Organ grinder]]s were commonly found busking in the old days.

Busking is common among some [[Romani people]]. Romantic mention of Romani music, dancers and fortune tellers are found in all forms of song poetry, prose and lore. The Roma brought the word busking to England by way of their travels along the [[Mediterranean]] coast to Spain and the Atlantic Ocean and then up north to England and the rest of Europe.

In medieval France buskers were known by the terms [[troubadour]]s and ''jongleurs''. In northern France they were known as trouveres. In old German buskers were known as [[Minnesingers]] and ''Spielleute''. In obsolete French it evolved to ''busquer'' for "seek, prowl" and was generally used to describe prostitutes. In Russia buskers are called [[skomorokh]] and their first recorded history appears around the 11th century.

[[Mariachi]]s, Mexican bands that play a style of music by the same name, frequently busk when they perform while traveling through streets and plazas, as well as in restaurants and bars.&lt;ref name="WebsterMariachi"&gt;[http://www.webster.com/dictionary/mariachi "mariachi"] Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=We like playing for big crowds, and the goal all along has been for people to pay a little to come and see us. But it all started on street corners, and that is still very connected to what we do. It's such a validating musical experience. Busking is a very humble and brave act that takes courage to do well. It's also about the energy of music being alive outside in a city ... You can walk right by it right in front of you. Sure, to some people you're just another guy with his hand out, so sometimes busking can be great social barometer. You're able to gauge who you live with on earth.&lt;ref name=Ferris&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferris|first=Jedd|title=Catching Up With ...

Around the mid-19th century Japanese ''[[Chindonya]]'' started to be seen using their skills for advertising, and these street performers are still occasionally seen in Japan. Another Japanese street performance form dating from the [[Edo period]] is [[Nankin Tamasudare]], in which the performer creates large figures using a bamboo mat.

In the United States, [[medicine show]]s proliferated in the 19th century. They were traveling vendors selling [[elixir]]s and [[potion]]s to improve the health. They would often employ entertainment acts as a way of making the clients feel better. The people would often associate this feeling of well-being with the products sold. After these performances they would "pass the hat".

[[One-man band]]s have historically performed as buskers playing a variety of instruments simultaneously. One-man bands proliferated in urban areas in the 19th and early 20th centuries and still perform to this day. A current one-man band plays all their instruments acoustically usually combining a guitar, a harmonica, a drum and a tambourine. They may also include singing. Many still busk but some are booked to play at festivals and other events.

[[Folk music]] has always been an important part of the busking scene. Cafe, restaurant, bar and pub busking is a mainstay of this art form. Two of the more famous folk singers are [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Joan Baez]]. The [[delta blues]]men were mostly itinerant musicians emanating from the Mississippi Delta region of the USA around the early 1940s and on. [[B.B. King]] is one famous example who came from these roots.

The [[counterculture]] of the [[hippie]]s of the 1960s occasionally staged "be-ins", which resembled some present-day busker festivals. Bands and performers would gather at public places and perform for free, passing the hat to make money. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] was at the epicenter of this movement – be-ins were staged at [[Golden Gate Park]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]'s Bee Stadium and other venues. Some of the bands that performed in this manner were [[Janis Joplin]] with [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Moby Grape]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]].

[[Christmas carol]]ing can also be a form of busking, as [[wassailing]] included singing for alms, [[wassail]] or some other form of refreshment such as [[figgy pudding]]. In Ireland the traditional Wren Boys and in England [[Morris Dancing]] can be considered part of the busking tradition.

In India and Pakistan's [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] region [[Bhavai]] is a form of street art where there are plays enacted in the village, the [[barot (caste)|barot]] or the village singer also is part of the local entertainment scene.

In the 2000s, some performers have begun "Cyber Busking". Artists post work or performances on the Internet for people to download or "stream" and if people like it they make a donation using [[PayPal]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Forms ==
There are three basic forms of street performance

'''"Circle shows"''' are shows that tend to gather a crowd around them. They usually have a distinct beginning and end. Usually these are done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], comedians, [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[juggle]]rs and sometimes musicians. Circle shows can be the most lucrative. Sometimes the crowds attracted can be very large. A good busker will control the crowd so the patrons do not obstruct foot traffic.

'''"Walk-by acts"''' are typically where the busker performs a musical, living statue or other act that does not have a distinct beginning or end and the public usually watch for a brief time. A walk by act may turn into a circle show if the act is unusual or very popular.

'''"Stoplight performers"''' present their act and get contributions from vehicle occupants on a crosswalk while the traffic lights are red. A variety of disciplines can be used in such format (juggling, break dancing, even magic tricks). Because of the short period of time available to them, stoplight performers must have a very brief, condensed routine. This form is seen more commonly in Central and South America than elsewhere.

=== Collecting money ===

Buskers collect donations and tips from the public in a variety of containers and by different methods depending on the type of busking they are performing. For walk by acts their instrument case or a special can or box is often used. For circle shows the performer will typically collect money at the end of the show, although some performers will also collect during the show to ensure all audience members have had a chance to show appreciation for their skills. Sometimes a performer will employ a ''bottler'', ''hat man'', or ''pitch man'' to collect money from the audience. The term ''bottler'' is a British term which originated following the use of the top half of a bottle to collect money. The bottle had a leather flap inserted in the bottle neck and a leather pouch attached. This design allowed coins to be put in the bottle but not allow them to be removed easily without the coins jingling against the glass. The first use of such contrivances was recorded by the famous [[Punch and Judy]] troupe of puppeteers in early Victorian times.&lt;ref name="Punch"&gt;Somerville, Chris (1997) [http://www.punchandjudy.com/bottle.htm Who is Mr Punch] ''punchandjudy.com''. Chris Somerville. Retrieved 2010-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Bottling itself can be an art form, and the difference between a good and a bad bottler can be crucial to the amount of money earned on a pitch. A good bottler is able to encourage audience members to give money. A bottler usually gets a cut of the money made on the pitch. Prior to the 20th century, it was common for buskers to use a trained monkey as a bottler. That practice has diminished or ceased in many countries due to changes in social attitudes and animal control laws. However some modern buskers use a device known as [[monkey stick]] which is a long stick with bottle caps or small cymbals attached to make a noise before a show or prior to making a collection.

The place where a performance occurs is called a "pitch". A good pitch can be the key to success as a busker. An act that might make money at one place and time may not work at all in another setting. Popular pitches tend to be public places with large volumes of pedestrian traffic, high visibility, low background noise and as few elements of interference as possible. Good locations may include tourist spots, popular parks, entertainment districts including lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs and theaters, [[rapid transit|subways]] and bus stops, outside the entrances to large concerts and sporting events, almost any [[plaza]] or [[town square]] as well as [[zócalo]]s in Latin America and [[piazza]]s in other regions. Other places include shopping malls, strip malls, and outside supermarkets, although permission is usually required from management for these.

In her book, ''Underground Harmonies: Music and Politics in the Subways of New York'', Susie J. Tanenbaum examined how the adage "Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast" plays out in regards to busking. Her sociological studies showed that in areas where buskers regularly perform, crime rates tended to go down, and that those with higher education attainment tended to have a more positive view of buskers than did those of lesser educational attainment.&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum"&gt;Tanenbaum, Susie, J.

Many cities in the United States have particular areas known to be popular spots for buskers. Performers are found at many locations like Mallory Square in [[Key West]], in [[New Orleans]], in New York around [[Central Park]], [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], and the subway systems, in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C. around the transit centers, in Los Angeles around [[Venice Beach]], the [[Santa Monica]] [[Third Street Promenade]], and the Hollywood area, in Chicago on [[Maxwell Street]], in the [[Delmar Loop]] district of [[St. Louis]], and many other locations throughout the US.
Busking is still quite common in Scotland, Ireland, and England with musicians and other street performers of varying talent levels.

In the United States under [[constitutional law]] and most European [[common law]], the protection of [[artistic]] [[free speech]] extends to busking. In the U.S. and many countries, the designated places for free speech behavior are the public [[park]]s, streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[thoroughfare]]s and [[town square]]s or [[plaza]]s. Under certain circumstances even private property may be open to buskers, particularly if it is open to the general public and busking does not interfere with its function and management allows it or other forms of free speech behaviors or has a history of doing so.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://funandmagic.com/decision.pdf Berger v.

While there is no universal [[code of conduct]] for buskers, there are common law practices which buskers must conform to. Most jurisdictions have corresponding [[statutory law]]. In the UK busking regulation is not universal with most laws (if there are any) being governed local councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who, what, why: Where is the hardest place in the UK to be a busker?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28112716|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some towns in the British Isles limit the licenses issued to bagpipers because of the volume and difficulty of the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In Great Britain places requiring licenses for buskers may also require auditions of anyone applying for a busking license.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Oxford City Council have decided to enact a [[public space protection order]]. Some venues that do not regulate busking may still ask performers to abide by voluntary rules. Some places require a special [[License|permit]] to use electronically amplified sound and may have limits on the [[Loudness|volume]] of sound produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411newyork.org/guide/2007/07/16/street-performances-in-new-york/ |title=Street Performances in New York |publisher=411newyork.org |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common law that buskers or others should not impede pedestrian traffic flow, block or otherwise obstruct entrances or exits, or do things that [[endangerment|endanger]] the public. It is common law that any disturbing or noisy behaviors may not be conducted after certain hours in the night. These curfew limitations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is common law that "performing blue" (i.e. using material that is sexually explicit or any vulgar or obscene remarks or gestures) is generally prohibited unless performing for an adults-only environment such as in a bar or pub.

In London, busking is prohibited in the entire borough of the City of London. The London Underground provides busking permits in tube stations. Most London boroughs do not license busking, but they have optional powers, under the London Local Authorities Act 2000, if there is sufficient reason to do so. Where these powers have not been adopted, Councils can rely on other legislation including the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to deal with noise nuisance from buskers and the Highways Act to deal with obstructions. Camden Council is currently looking into further options to control the problem of nuisance buskers and the playing of amplified music to the detriment of local residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-insider.co.uk/2010/02/busking-in-london-explained-guide/|title= The Big Busk: London Busking Explained |author=Appleton, Natalie |date=7 February 2010|publisher= The London Insider|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buskers may find themselves targeted by thieves due to the very open and public nature of their craft. Buskers may have their earnings, instruments or props stolen. One particular technique that thieves use against buskers is to pretend to make a donation while actually taking money out instead, a practice known as "dipping" or "skimming". [[George Burns]] described his days as a youthful busker this way:&lt;ref name="CigarBurns"&gt;[http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,3,00.html The Ultimate Cigar Aficionado: Ninety-eight-year-old George Burns Shares Memories of His Life] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307054715/http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,3,00.html |date=7 March 2010 }}, article and interview by Cigar Aficionado Online&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Street theatre''' is a form of [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] and presentation in outdoor [[public space]]s without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including [[Shopping mall|shopping centres]], [[Parking lot|car parks]], recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range from [[busking|busker]]s to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is used to convey a message to the crowd watching it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2011/08/street-plays-a-means-of-spreading-awareness/&lt;/ref&gt; Street play is considered to be the rawest form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Sometimes performers are commissioned, especially for street [[festival]]s, children's shows or [[parade]]s, but more often street theatre performers are unpaid or gather some income through the dropping of a coin in a hat by the audience.

The logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple [[costume]]s and [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, and often there is little or no [[Electronic amplifier|amplification]] of sound, with actors depending on their natural [[human voice|vocal]] and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that [[physical theatre]], including dance, [[mime artist|mime]] and [[slapstick]], is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd.

Street theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or [[rope]]d off) and a [[Ticket (admission)|ticketed]] audience.

In some cases, street theatre performers have to get a [[licence]] or specific permission through [[local government|local]] or [[State (subnational)|state]] [[government]]s in order to perform. Many performers travel internationally&lt;ref&gt;[http://performers.net/ International list of performers]&lt;/ref&gt; to certain locations of note.

Street theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious [[passion plays]] and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in [[variety theatre]]s, [[music hall]]s and in [[vaudeville]], now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include [[Robin Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin Williams began his career on the streets of San Francisco as a street performer: https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800013042/bio&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowie]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Harry Anderson]].

Street theatre allows people who might not have ever been to, or been able to afford to go to, traditional theatre. The audience is made up of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free entertainment.

==Reasons for staging work on the street==

Performance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled ''Our Daily Bread''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CaeserPinkOurDailyBread-OrgyStreetTheateronWallStreet Archive Video]&lt;/ref&gt; that brought performers onto the streets of the New York's financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of [[Wonder Bread]] along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people's souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives.

Other artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to 'the man on the street' may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination.

Some contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as [[Carnival]], [[commedia dell'arte]] etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context.

Whatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of [[Welfare State International]] argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = Coult | editor-first = Tony | editor2-last = Kershaw | editor2-first = Baz | title = Engineers of the Imagination: The Welfare State Handbook | publisher = Methuen | year = 1983 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oPkCAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;dq=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;pgis=1 | isbn = 0-413-52800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSI India street play.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A street play (''nukkad natak'') in [[Dharavi]] slums in Mumbai]].
Many companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the [[guerrilla theatre]] of [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doyle | first = Michael William | title = Imagine Nation: The American Counterculture of the '60s and '70s | publisher = Routeledge | year = 2001 | url = http://www.diggers.org/guerrilla_theater.htm | isbn = 0-415-93040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Living Theatre]], the carnivalesque parades of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], and the work of [[Ashesh Malla]] and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of [[Nepal]].

A character-based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a ''[[Candid Camera]]'' way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.

Another example would be Natural Theatre's Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.

'''''Superstars''''' is an all-around sports competition that pits elite athletes from different sports against one another in a series of athletic events resembling a [[decathlon]]. Points are awarded for the position in which the competitor places in each event. The competitor with the most points at the end of all ten events is declared the champion.

On the original ABC version, an athlete could compete in up to seven events, but no athlete was permitted to compete in the sport(s) of his or her profession. In the World, International, European and British versions of the contest, athletes would compete in 8 out of 10 events, with no one generally allowed to take part in their own sport, although some handicapping rules did apply.

The idea was developed by 1948 and 1952 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating champion [[Dick Button]]. He shopped the idea to all three U.S. television networks, and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] bought it as a special for the winter of 1973. The first Superstars competition was held in [[Rotonda West, Florida]] in March 1973 and was won by pole vaulter [[Bob Seagren]]. The [[BBC]] covered the competition and aired their own programme, featuring British athletes on 31 December 1973, which was won by 400 metre hurdles Olympic champion [[David Hemery]]. Television broadcasts of the competitions were popular both in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Further events featuring European athletes started from 1975, with six World Superstars championships taking place from 1977 to 1982.

Competitors participate in a range of different sporting events, including a [[100-yard dash]]/[[100m sprint]], [[800 metres|half mile (800 m)]] run, [[obstacle course]] or [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], weightlifting, [[soccer]] skills, [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[tennis]], [[basketball]], [[bicycle racing]], [[Shooting sports|shooting]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. The sports have varied over time and between the various national and international competitions; in the first competition there was no obstacle course, but [[table tennis]] and [[baseball]] hitting were included, while the European versions featured a 600m Steeplechase, indoor cycling on a highly banked velodrome, and the infamous 'Gym Tests'.

Canadian [[soccer]] player [[Brian Budd]] was unbeaten in Superstars contests, winning the World Championship three times from 1978 to 1980, making him the most successful Superstar of all time.

==British, European and International Superstars==

===1973===
[[File:Dick Button at 1980 Winter Olympics.jpg|thumb|right|Dick Button, the creator of the US version of ''Superstars'']]Originally aired in the US by ABC in March 1973, Superstars was first broadcast in Britain on 31 December 1973 as "Britain's Sporting Superstars", closely following the American format.  [[David Vine]], who was the main presenter of the BBC programme from 1973 to 1985, said "in 1972, [[Ron Pickering]], myself, [[Don Revie]], [[Billy Bremner]] and TV producer [[Barney Colehan]] sat in a hotel in [[Leeds]] and formulated Superstars but the BBC dismissed the idea. Then Dick Button started it in the States and the BBC bought the rights".&lt;ref&gt;"Superstars: Best of the Best" BBC DVD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Recorded at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] in August and promoted as a challenge between Britain's seven best sportsmen, the contest was won by [[David Hemery]], the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic champion]] in the 400 metres hurdles, defeating [[Jackie Stewart]], [[Bobby Moore]], [[Joe Bugner]], [[Roger Taylor (tennis)|Roger Taylor]], [[Tony Jacklin]] and [[Barry John]]. Featuring the first ever gym test (devised by Pickering, and comprising circuit running, a medicine ball throw, parallel bar dips and squat thrusts) the event came down to the final steeplechase, where Hemery overcame a 100m handicap to pass Barry John with 60 metres left. Shown on New Year's Eve, the programme was a major success and was repeated the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/355940|title=– Britain's Sporting Superstars BFI Page|work=BFI|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1974===
In the second event in 1974, World Light-Heavyweight boxing champion [[John Conteh]] comfortably beat an ill Hemery and [[Colin Bell]] to win the title, again at Crystal Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/725131|title=The Sporting Superstars|work=BFI|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conteh credited the highly competitive nature of the competition with increasing his abilities as a boxer, the inception of this cross-sport contest quickly encouraged many top athletes to push themselves further, introducing the idea that the winner could claim to be the country's "top sportsman" and also provided an arena where recently retired champions (such as Hemery and [[Lynn Davies]]) could extend their careers.&lt;ref&gt;"Superstars: Best of the Best" BBC DVD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975===
Following the success of the first two standalone UK competitions, in 1975 the British national Superstars contest was suspended, and the event was widened to include participants from continental [[Europe]]. Five preliminary heats were held, followed by a final at the [[Ahoy Rotterdam|Ahoy]] indoor arena in Rotterdam, famous for its banked, wooden cycling track. This proved to make Superstars a major hit, achieving large audiences across the continent and paving the way for the International and World Superstars editions to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuperstars.org/comp/75eurofinal.html|title=1975 EUROPEAN FINAL|publisher=Thesuperstars.org|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorable events in the first year of European Superstars included [[Malcolm Macdonald]] winning the 100m sprint in a Superstars record time of 10.9 seconds (after being made to run the race twice following the false start of another competitor), David Hemery being beaten by Dutch field hockey player [[Ties Kruize]] following a fall in the 600m [[Steeplechase (athletics)|Steeplechase]], Swedish Discus thrower [[Ricky Bruch]] setting records in the weight lifting and medicine ball throw section of the gym tests and the first appearance of pole vaulter [[Kjell Isaksson]], who dominated the final heat in Sweden, scoring a then record 69 (out of a possible 80) points.&lt;ref&gt;"Superstars: Best of the Best" BBC DVD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the final in Rotterdam, Kruize was badly injured in a car accident and was replaced by Hemery, who finished second. Kjell Isaksson dominated the event again, winning four of his eight events and finished second or third in three others, winning the title with an event to spare.

The rules for European Superstars allowed athletes to compete in "near specialist" events with a handicap, meaning that both Hemery and Isaksson were allowed to run in the 100m and Steeplechase, but only after giving the other finalists a head start. In the final 600m Steeplechase event Hemery made up a 100m handicap on his rivals in order to finish in overall second, after again falling badly at the water jump and running the last 100m with badly torn ankle ligaments.&lt;ref&gt;Superstars:1975 EUROPEAN FINAL, BBC TV, 31 December 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976===
In 1976 national competitions were resumed and Hemery again became UK Superstar, beating Conteh and [[Formula 1]] World Champion [[James Hunt]] easily. By now Hemery was a "professional Superstar", competing in Britain, Europe and the US, and devising his own training regime. His performances duly improved, and even though [[Judo at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympic Judoka]] [[David Starbrook]] took his parallel bar dips record in the gym tests, Hemery had become Britain's top competitor.

[[File:Bjorn Borg (1979).jpg|thumb|right| Björn Borg won his heat in European Superstars at Vichy, but was unable to compete again because of scheduling conflicts with his tennis career.]] In European Superstars, Isaksson beat Hemery in a heat held in Sweden. Two of the highest profile heat winners, [[Björn Borg]] and [[Kevin Keegan]], were not able to compete in the Rotterdam final due to scheduling conflicts. Keegan's victory produced a memorable moment when he crashed during the cycle racing in his heat. With deep cuts and abrasions to his arm, shoulder and back, the [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] footballer was expected to withdraw, but with a large crowd present to watch him he said "These people here in the stands have come here to see me make a fool of myself and they've got a right to it!",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/oliver-brown/9679031/London-2012-Olympic-heroes-make-a-fitting-cast-of-Superstars.html|title=London 2012 Olympic heroes make a fitting cast of Superstars|publisher=Telegraph|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=21 June 2015|first=Oliver|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; got back on his bike and won the re-ride.  Keegan then easily won the steeplechase, but like many of the highest profile performers, his schedule was too full to allow him to compete as regularly as the Superstars format demanded. Partly because of this, less renowned athletes like Isaksson came to dominate and be recognised outside their specialisms.

In the Ahoy final, Isaksson won five events and finished 20 points ahead of his nearest rival. The top eight finishers were also guaranteed a place at the inaugural World Superstars competition, to be held in the US the following year.

===1977===
1977 provided two new champions, with Isaksson taking part only in the World contest and David Hemery competing in American Superstars. In the UK national Superstars, rower [[Tim Crooks]] beat future [[1983 World's Strongest Man|World's Strongest Man]] [[Geoff Capes]] in a tight contest, but failed to qualify for the European final, losing by one point to [[François Tracanelli]] in the Spanish heat. Representing Great Britain instead at the Ahoy final was [[Rugby League]] player [[Keith Fielding]], who finished a close second, matching Hemery's best ever performance by a British Superstar.

The winner of 1977 European Superstars was the returning Ties Kruize, who was now fully recovered from his car crash. With just the indoor steeplechase left, Kruize was one point behind [[Jean-Paul Coche]] but five ahead of Fielding. With Coche having completed his events Fielding needed to win the final race, with Kruize finishing no better than third. With Fielding already finished (and celebrating) Kruize passed [[Speed Skating|speed skater]] [[Hans van Helden]] on the final straight to win by 2.5 points. An exhausted Fielding then told BBC TV that the loss was "a damn, bloody shame", but both qualified for the 1978 World Championship.

===1979===
There was no UK national or European Superstars contest in 1978, but both events returned in 1979, along with a new "Past Masters" event for competitors over 35, which was won by [[Lynn Davies]], the [[Athletics at the 1964 Summer Olympics – Men's long jump|1964 Olympic Long Jump]] champion. 1979 saw the first appearances of judoka [[Brian Jacks]], who became Britain's most famous Superstar. Jacks had enormous upper body strength and quickly came to dominate the gym tests, setting records in squat thrusts and, in particular, the parallel bar dips. In the 1979 UK national final Jacks comprehensively beat the field, and then went on to compete in Rotterdam for the European title.

No Briton had ever won this title, but Jacks was a strong favourite against defending champion Ties Kruize. Jacks won the gym tests and set a new record time in the cycling. At start of the final event, the  steeplechase, Jacks had a small lead, but was out of events. Kruize accumulated enough points in the steeplechase to join Jacks in a tie for first place. With no tie-breaking system in operation both men were crowned European Superstar, making Jacks the most successful British Superstar ever. Jacks succumbed to [[shingles]] in late 1979 so was unable to travel to [[The Bahamas]] for the World Championship.

===1980===
Superstars regularly attracted over 10 million TV viewers in the UK and Jacks became a household name, appearing on children's TV shows and picking up endorsements usually beyond the reach of a minority sport participant. Superstars also expanded again in 1980, adding International Superstars to its list of programmes, though this was as a direct replacement for the European event. Although popular in the UK, US, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Australia, Superstars reached its peak at the turn of the decade, and one by one (starting in Europe) the participating nations fell away.

Against Jacks in 1980 was [[Daley Thompson]], globally recognised as the top multi-sports athlete after his victory in the [[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics – Men's decathlon|1980 Olympic Games decathlon]] competition. With Brian Budd in attendance for the UK National final, Brian Jacks took on Thompson, [[Steve Assinder]] from Basketball, [[Modern Pentathlon|pentathlete]] [[Danny Nightingale]] and the new "Past Master", former 400m hurdler [[John Sherwood (athlete)|John Sherwood]], who won all his events in the heats, setting a new record.

In the gym tests Jacks scored 80 in the dips and 73 in the squat thrusts, and finished 18 points ahead of Sherwood in second place. Thompson finished third. John Sherwood in finishing in second place gained a place in the World Championships and with it the possibility of big prize money. To ensure that he was able to finish second Sherwood had to turn professional part-way through the competition in order to compete in the 100m (as his status as an amateur track and field athlete would normally have barred him from competing in this event). Although many amateur athletes (most notably Kjell Isaksson) had competed in Superstars since its inception, they had never been able to retain any prize money, with this instead going to their sport. In winning three World Superstar titles, Brian Budd won over $130,000, while [[Bob Seagren]] (the first World Champion) won over $200,000.

In International Superstars in Israel Jacks defeated both of the other European Superstars champions Ties Kruize and Kjell Isaksson, as well as [[1980 Tour de France]] winner [[Joop Zoetemelk]] to claim the new title.

For Sherwood – a PE teacher from [[Sheffield]] at this time, and not a full-time sportsman – the World Championship proved to be a success, but not for Jacks, aiming to become the first European to win the title. In The Bahamas both Britons won events: Jacks in the weightlifting and the gym tests&amp;mdash;after an epic struggle against Brian Budd&amp;mdash;and Sherwood in the cycle race. However, it was Sherwood's two second-places in the football and 800 metres that propelled him into second place, with the cycling coming at Jacks' expense, and winning him $15,000 in the process. He was officially now Britain's best ever Superstar, although he had still finished 26 points behind Budd.

===1981===

To start the 1981 season, the BBC decided to invite the most successful British Superstars back for a one-off "Challenge of the Champions" programme, featuring all the past winners of the UK National contest, as well as the two "Past Masters" and the two men who had won heats of European Superstars. Joining Brian Jacks were David Hemery, Keith Fielding, Lynn Davies, John Conteh, Tim Crooks, Malcolm MacDonald and John Sherwood.

This was arguably the strongest ever UK Superstars contest, and with so many competitive sportsmen present it was no surprise that records tumbled. Jacks was the heavy favourite, and duly won his 'banker' events, but his inability to compete in the running tests left him facing huge obstacles.
His performance in the gym tests was simply astonishing, smashing his own parallel bars record in the starkly lit  Wycombe sports centre with an awesome 100 in 54 seconds; had he pushed himself all the way to the minute he could easily have added more. His innovative 'rocking' technique (like Budd's sliding squat thrusts) was widely copied, but none of his rivals could get anywhere near him, and though Sherwood again pushed him close in the squats section, in reality Jacks was in a class of one here.

The key to winning Superstars had become to gain maximum points in your best events and then to place as highly in the others – simple in theory, but appallingly hard in practice. Jacks usually dominated in the gym and weightlifting, and almost always also won the cycling and canoeing. That gave him a nominal 40 point head start on his rivals, but if this sequence could be disrupted, then Jacks was relying on picking up more points elsewhere. He never competed in the two running events and was a weaker shot that his rivals, so he was then faced with winning the basketball or swimming which were much more equal events. And in the Challenge of the Champions Keith Fielding was able to disrupt Jacks' strategy by enough to beat him.

Early on Jacks was looking good, beating Fielding in a record time to win the canoeing, but once Fielding had won the cycling Jacks was beaten. Fielding had entered the event hoping to take the Superstars 100m record first and foremost, and then to put up a good showing against Jacks. Now he was the ultimate champion.

The key had been his ability to score well throughout – he was second in the steeplechase for instance – and even losing his 'banker' (the 100m to David Hemery) was not a problem. By winning the steeplechase in the final event, Lynn Davies was able to push Jacks down into third place, and with injuries forcing the judoka to miss the 1981 British final later that season, this would be an ignominious end to his Superstars story. For Fielding, the forgotten man of 1978, this was a new dawn that he followed up by a second convincing win in the UK final.

[[File:Scheckter Monza 1979.jpg|thumb|right| Jody Scheckter famously won the 1981 World Superstars Championship after applying motor oil to his training shoes to help him slide faster during the squat thrusts contest.]] Here, in a new venue [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], the Rugby League winger reached his Superstars highpoint, dominating Davies, pentathlete [[Jim Fox (pentathlete)|Jim Fox]] and new challenger [[Andy Ripley]] from Rugby Union with a strong all-round performance. He had his share of luck (water skier [[Mike Hazelwood (water skier)|Mike Hazelwood]] was tied in first place in the shooting when he mis-fired the decisive shot, gifting 10 points to Fielding) but he was on top form this season. He had every reason to believe he had a strong chance in both International and World Superstars later that year, but, as so often in Superstars, he could not hold his form; the ever-increasing levels of competition saw him lose, first to a resurgent Ripley in the second International, then to a motor-oil powered [[Jody Schekter]] in the 1981 World Final. Again, Fielding would never win another Superstars event. The curse of the European champions seemed to be holding strong.

===1982: A British World Champion===

Since 1978, the BBC had also produced an equally popular British Superteams event, which was dominated from the start by the "Athletes" – a team of [[Track and Field]] stars, who won every series but the final one in 1985. From 1979 a stand-out performer in this team was [[Brian Hooper]], a pole-vaulter with an immense will to win. He first came to prominence in the 1979 Superteams final, failing to be able to jump onto a [[balance beam]] in the [[obstacle course]] event, and by 1982 he had blossomed into a fine, all-round performer.

Leading the 1982 Athletes team to Superteams victory, Hooper was trailed by the BBC as the new challenger to watch in that season's UK final. He was a strong swimmer, almost unbeatable in the canoeing and gym tests, and competitive in all his other events. And then he lost in his heat, to [[Karate]] fighter [[Vic Charles]], and his promise seemed lost. However, Charles was unable to compete in the 1982 final, and Hooper was his replacement. He would go on to win his next five straight Superstars events, becoming two time British Superstar, three-time International Superstar, and the 1982 World Superstar Champion. Only Brian Budd has a better record in the competition.

Hooper's victory in the 1982 World Championship came at the expense of defending World Champion [[Jody Scheckter]], and [[American football|American Footballers]] [[James Lofton]], [[Cris Collinsworth]] and [[Mark Gastineau]]. Hooper later stated that he felt pressured by the aggressive nature of the US challengers, which came to a head in the final of the bike race, where he found himself boxed in by several rivals all seemingly working in concert to hold him back. Charging through powerfully and fairly, Hooper finished comfortably in the lead, but was then faced with official protests, claiming he either took a short-cut off the track or otherwise acted illegally. He clearly had not, and was quickly declared the legitimate winner. Victories in the rowing and second place in the gym test and swimming saw him win by just 3/4 of a point from talented runner Lofton. He was however 10 3/4 points clear entering the final event (and thus guaranteed to win the title) and coasted through his obstacle course heat. As only the two fastest heat winners ran in the final, Hooper could not add to his tally. Lofton on the other hand had $10000 to fight for, and bested [[Renaldo Nehemiah]] in the final event, and duly took second place, something again he was virtually guaranteed before the event.

By now a professional Superstar (he won $37000 for the 1982 World Championship), Brian Hooper dominated British and International Superstars until he retired in 1984. He beat all of the major British Superstars of his era except Brian Jacks, who had previously retired through injury. Returning to the event age 50 in 2004, Hooper competed ably despite a torn pectoral muscle, finishing fourth against rivals at least 15 years younger than himself. Even now he still won the [[kayaking]] and came second in [[golf]], almost making the final, beaten only in the end by an agonising uphill bike race.

===1983 to 1985: End of the first era===
Though Brian Hooper continued to compete in (and dominate) Superstars events until he retired in 1984, he stopped competing in the UK national contest after 1983, and he was succeeded as national champion in 1984 by athlete [[Garry Cook]]. The 1983 championship was also notable for the record breaking performances of [[Des Drummond]] in the 100m, with the agile [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh Rugby League]] player managing to lower the mark down to only 10.85 seconds, in itself a time comparable with many full-time track and field athletes who would compete in the [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|1984 Summer Olympics]]. The final also saw Hooper beat Vic Charles (the only man ever to finish above him in any Superstars competition at that point).

In the 1984 final Garry Cook was pushed very close by professional [[stunt performer]] and [[motorcycle]] racer, [[Eddie Kidd]], but he held on against a weaker field than usual to become champion. Cook also competed in the now more popular ''Superteams'' series, as part of the never-defeated 'Athletes' team, who were only finally beaten during the last season of the show in 1985. By now the BBC had decided that the programme was in need of 'freshening up' and had altered the format several times, changing the format of the gym tests to include bar jumps and adding computerised scoring to stop the trend of sliding squat thrusts. The programme was also moved to [[Portsmouth]] and took on a naval theme, adding a [[field gun competition]] in a bid to boost flagging ratings. The final series of ''Superteams'' was duly won by 'Watersports' (a team representing swimming, water-skiing and diving) which was led by Olympic swimmer [[Robin Brew]] who excelled at running events and also in the gym tests, where the bar jump became his speciality.

Continuing this success, Brew reached the final of the 1985 UK national championship where he narrowly beat a strong field, including [[Rugby League]] player [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]], Olympic silver medallist [[Judoka]] [[Neil Adams (judoka)|Neil Adams]] and then only a one-time Olympic gold medal winning rower, [[Steve Redgrave]]. The RAF officer then completed a successful first year in Superstars by becoming the last ever International champion, this time much more comfortably.

A new period of Superstars dominance could have evolved for Brew, but with the UK version being the only surviving national championship outside the United States, and no prospect of World Superstars being revived, once TWI decided to halt production of International Superstars the BBC version was soon cancelled as well. With viewing figures falling, and potential participants ever more pressurised into not entering by scheduling conflicts and insurance demands the BBC's decision to end the show was neither unexpected or mourned, and although David Vine, Ron Pickering and executive producer Peter Hylton Cleaver did fight to keep the show on air, it was all to no avail.

Over the next fifteen years, though the US version continued unabated, Superstars in the UK existed solely as a nostalgic memory for sporting clip shows, usually focussing on Kevin Keegan falling off his bike, [[Stan Bowles]] shooting the table instead of a target, or Brian Jacks eating oranges. During the 1990s BBC programmes (such as ''[[Fantasy Football League]]'') regularly made use of this footage – and kept the show in the public spotlight – while [[Sky Sports]] began to show full-length programmes on its ''Sky Sports Classic'' channel. This, together with a new generation of television executives and sports presenters who grew up as fans of the show created interest in a revival, which finally happened as part of the 2002 [[Sport Relief]] charity event.

=== 2002 to 2004: Sport Relief and a new era ===

In 2002, the BBC held a one-off, but truncated, UK Championship as a major feature of its biannual [[Sport Relief]] charity telethon. Featuring a field including [[Steve Redgrave|Sir Steve Redgrave]], [[Martin Offiah]], [[John Regis (athlete)|John Regis]], [[Austin Healey]] and [[Chris Boardman]], the event was a first for a British Superstars event in that it featured both non-British competitors ([[Dwight Yorke]] and [[Gianluca Vialli]]) and also female participants ([[Alex Coomber]] and [[Stephanie Cook]]). With only seven events (as opposed to the usual eight or ten) and being only part of a larger event instead of being a stand-alone series, the contest was different from those of the earlier era.

While the participants were no less able, the event was less 'competitive', with no prize money at stake and no European, World or International contest to qualify for. It was dominated by Healey, who won four of his five events, and came runner-up in the other. Stephanie Cook was the other stand-out performer, finishing joint second with Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman, and finishing runner-up in two events.

The event was an overwhelming success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/special_events/sport_relief/2126921.stm|title=BBC SPORT  - Special Events - Sport Relief  - Sport Relief as it happened|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it inspired the BBC to create a new UK Championship series in 2003. Produced by [[Trans World International|TWI]] and held in [[La Manga Club]] in Spain, this time it was a full event with heats and a final, something that had not been part of the series since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SGVU6qe5iacJ:www.broadcastnow.co.uk/bbc-brings-back-70s-superstars/1110368.article+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|title=BBC brings back 70s Superstars|publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008: Revival on Five===
On 29 April 2008, it was announced that the show would be returning on [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] for the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athletics-weekly.com/newsarticle.php?id=530 Athletes feature in new Superstars TV series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522101402/http://www.athletics-weekly.com/newsarticle.php?id=530 |date=May 22, 2009 }} Athletics Weekly. Retrieved 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by TWI with eight one-hour shows. In a change of format, the competitors were split into four teams, captained by [[Kelly Holmes]], [[Steve Redgrave]], [[Roger Black]] and [[Mike Catt]].

===2012: Olympic Superstars===

Following the success of [[Team GB]] at the [[2012 London Olympics]], the BBC revived ''Superstars'' for a single special edition that aired on Saturday 29 December at 6.45pm, comprising a men's and women's UK championship.  Presented by [[Gabby Logan]], [[Iwan Thomas]] and [[Denise Lewis]], the event was held on 24 &amp; 25 November 2012, at the sports facilities of the [[University of Bath#Sports and TeamBath|University of Bath]].

The show featured Olympic medallists who were coached for swimming by [[Rebecca Adlington]], and the competitors were: [[Alistair Brownlee]], [[Jonathan Brownlee]], [[Mo Farah]], [[Robbie Grabarz]], [[Michael Jamieson]], [[Anthony Joshua]], [[Andrew Triggs Hodge]], [[Peter Wilson (sport shooter)|Peter Wilson]], [[Nicola Adams]], [[Lizzie Armitstead]], [[Laura Bechtolsheimer]], [[Gemma Gibbons]], [[Helen Glover (rower)|Helen Glover]], [[Katherine Grainger]], [[Jade Jones (taekwondo)|Jade Jones]], [[Christine Ohuruogu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/superstars-2012.html|title=BBC - BBC One to broadcast Superstars 2012 with Team GB athletes - Media centre|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Men's Championship was won comfortably by Olympic Super-heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua, while the Women's Championship was won even more convincingly by women's [[coxless pair]] Olympic champion Helen Glover. Joshua won with an event to spare, while Glover won her final event (the Gym Tests) to win the Women's Superstars title by 14 points.

* In 1979 Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks finished as joint-winners of the European Championship.

===Miscellany and Records===

* Three men each won two European or International Superstars championships: Swedish pole vaulter [[Kjell Isaksson]], Dutch field hockey player [[Ties Kruize]] and British judoka [[Brian Jacks]]. [[Brian Hooper]] won three, and one World championship.
* One of the European competitors was [[Ivo Van Damme]], a middle-distance runner who was killed in a road accident in 1976.
*For most of the duration of the run of this programme on BBC TV, the programmes' producer was [[Peter Hylton Cleaver]].
* Brian Jacks had a computer game based on the competition, ''Brian Jacks Superstar Challenge'', named after him.
* In 1982, electronic scoring systems were introduced, with pressure pads for the [[squat thrust]]s. These originally ran on the [[Commodore VIC-20]], and later on the [[BBC Micro]]. The programs were developed and the system operated by [[Simon Taylor (photographer / author)|Simon Taylor]].
* In the spin-off called ''The Superteams'' a memorable moment was when British athlete [[Garry Cook]] played goalkeeper in the six-a-side hockey contest without wearing a helmet, running out of the [[D circle]] and tackling an opponent.
* The BBC ''Superstars'' used a musical theme composed by [[Johnny Pearson]] titled "[[Heavy Action]]". This piece of music later became familiar to Americans as the theme music for ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.
*After each event, the competitor who is ranked first gains 10 points, the next best ranked gets 7, then 4, 2 and then finally 1 point. These points are then totalled up to give a total out of 80 (from a maximum of eight events). Lynn Davies won seven of his eight events in the 1979 UK Past Masters contest and scored 70 points (a record).

''The Superstars'' was first broadcast by [[ABC Sports]] as a two-hour special in 1973. [[Bob Seagren]], an Olympic [[pole vault]] gold medalist, was the first winner. However, it was [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] boxer [[Joe Frazier]] who nearly stole the show. In the very first event, the 50 meter swimming heats, Frazier nearly drowned, and only after he was retrieved from the pool did he admit to commentators that he didn't know how to swim. When a reporter asked him why he tried the race, Frazier replied, "How was I to know I couldn't unless I tried it?". He also famously opined, "That [[Mark Spitz]]," (who had won several gold medals for swimming at the 1972 Olympics) "is a tough muthafucker!"{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Spin-offs included a women's version of the show, and a ''Superteams'' version, where the two World Series and Super Bowl teams each faced off (except that the owner of the [[New York Yankees]] at the time, [[George Steinbrenner]] prohibited his players from competing, so in years where the Yankees were in the World Series, their league's runner-up competed instead), with the winners competing in the finals. There were also brief runs of versions for celebrities and for juniors, where each state's Department of Education was asked to nominate one [[high school]], and those schools each sent one boy and one girl to qualifying rounds, with the final aired on TV.

The show remained popular in the 1970s, but ratings declined and the last edition produced by ABC came in 1984. [[NBC Sports]] picked up the program the next year and carried it from 1985 to 1990. ABC took the show back in 1991, and broadcast it through 1994. During a three-year period (1991–1993) the event was held in [[Cancun, Mexico]]. The competitions were held in different areas of Cancun Palace and Melia Cancun hotels. During that period former great NFL players [[Frank Gifford]], [[Dan Dierdorf]] and [[Lynn Swann]] worked as commentators of the Superstars Tournament.

There was no American version for three years (1995–1997) then ABC revived the show in 1998 and broadcast it through 2002. [[CBS Sports]] picked up the show the next year.

Several athletes won the event two or more times. Among them:
* [[Kyle Rote, Jr.]], Soccer, 1974, 1976, 1977
* [[Renaldo Nehemiah]], [[track and field athletics|track and field]]/[[American football]], 1981–83, 1986
* [[Herschel Walker]], American football, 1987–88
* [[Willie Gault]], American football, 1989–90
* [[Dave Johnson (decathlete)|Dave Johnson]], decathlon, 1993–94
* [[Jason Sehorn]], American football, 1998–2000

[[Speed skating|Speed skater]] [[Anne Henning]] won three straight women's competitions (1976–78). [[Basketball]] player [[Ann Meyers]] matched that feat in 1981 through 1983. [[Volleyball]] player [[Linda Fernandez]] won two straight events in 1979 and 1980.

===2009 edition===
In 2009 the franchise was revived for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. [[The Superstars (2009 edition)|''The Superstars'']] paired athletes and celebrities to compete as a team. [[Kristi Leskinen]] ([[Freestyle Skiing]]) and [[Maksim Chmerkovskiy]] ([[Ballroom Dancing]]) won the competition.

===Obstacle Course variations===
The popular obstacle course was the final event of the original ''Superstars'' to determine the overall winner. The ''Superteams'' version featured the obstacle course as an earlier event. The original course had the contestants climb a 12' rope wall, run through a tubular tunnel, push a blocking sled (or traverse across monkey bars in the Women's and ''Superteams'' versions), cleanly step through a dozen tires (2 rows of 6), jump over a water hazard (rectangular pool of water), clear a 4'6" high bar, jump two sets of hurdles and cross the FINISH line. Penalty seconds were added for missing tires, stepping in the water hazard and knocking down the high bar and/or hurdles. Some athletes have shown super skills on this course by climbing the wall without using the rope and clearing the high bar like a hurdle.

For the 2009 "elimination event" version, contestants have to climb a rope wall, duck under four rope hurdles (2 sets side-by-side) (this was changed mid-season to a balance beam just over 3-inches wide), cleanly step through a bungee grid, ascend and descend a large ramp, push through a large door-like block, jump two sets of hurdles, run through a [[cargo net]] and cross the FINISH line.

===SuperTeams===
A companion competition, this event would pit the two World Series teams and the two Super Bowl teams in a playoff-type match using all the Superstars events, with some team events added such as Hawaiian rowing and the Tug-of-War. The running, swimming, and cycling events were relays, with the cycling done on tandem bikes; the obstacle course (which had its blocking sleds replaced by monkey bars similar to those used in the women's competition, as it was felt that the football teams would have too much of an advantage over the baseball teams) was decided by best combined time. The team that won the most events in each semi-final advanced to the SuperTeams finals where an ultimate champions would be crowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuperstars.org|title='The Superstars': a page describing the Superstars competitions over the years.|publisher=Thesuperstars.org|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Yankees advanced to the World Series in 1977, 1978, and 1981, and was eligible to participate in these events held the early in the following year, however Yankees owner George Steinbrenner refused to allow his players to compete, as he had several of his top players under lucrative long term guaranteed contracts that required players to get ownership permission to participate in outside athletic activities, which in this case Steinbrenner refused to grant. In those years, loser of the ALCS in those years took the Yankees place, and in all three years that team ultimately won the competition.

In the 1978 final, the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Kansas City Royals]] split the first six events, so the tug-of-war would decide the winner. However, while there was a time limit in the preliminary rounds, there was none in the final, and after 75 minutes in which neither team came particularly close to winning, the organizers declared the event (and, as a result, the competition) a tie.

=== SuperTeams Winners ===
*1975 – [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]
*1976 – [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]
*1977 – [[Cincinnati Reds]]
*1978 – (tie) [[Dallas Cowboys]] &amp; [[Kansas City Royals]]
*1979 – [[Kansas City Royals]]

[[File:BobSeagren.jpg|thumb|right| Bob Seagren won the inaugural World Superstars Championship at Callaway Gardens in Georgia in 1977]]

In 1976, following the success of the ''Superstars'' programme in the US, Britain and mainland Europe, [[Dick Button]] and American host broadcaster [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] decided to organise a World Superstars Final, to be held the following March at [[Callaway Gardens]] in Georgia.

The participants in the inaugural "World Superstars Championship" were to be the competitors from across the various national and continental versions of the show with the best records in the previous years, and as such the US was to be represented by its previous national champions [[Bob Seagren]], [[O. J. Simpson]], and three time reigning current champion [[Kyle Rote, Jr.|Kyle Rote, Jr]]. The rest of the participants were to be drawn from the top six finishers from the 1976 European Superstars final, the top six from the US version in 1977, and the winner of the 1976 Canadian Superstars event. In reality, as was always an issue for Superstars, several competitors withdrew in the weeks before the contest, with Rote and Simpson pulling out just a week before taping, leaving a slightly weakened field headed by Seagren, double European champion [[Kjell Isaksson]], Canadian champion [[Tony Gabriel]] and the joint runners-up from the US final [[Guy Drut]] and [[Dave Casper]].

Aside from the withdrawals of Rote and Simpson the other major omission from the field was the double British champion and 1975 European runner-up [[David Hemery]] who was studying at university in the US, and had failed to qualify for the 1976 European final after finishing a narrow third in his heat. Had he paddled his Kayak 0.4 seconds faster or scored two more points in the pistol shooting he would have made the final, and with other strong European challengers (like [[Ties Kruize]], [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Björn Borg]]) also absent, the European challenge was significantly poorer.

The contest started with [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]], where [[Peter Snell]] capitalised on a mistake from fellow athlete [[Frank Nusse]] to win the first ten points, then the penalty shoot-out. Here [[Gareth Edwards]] was one kick away from winning nearly $5000, but he fluffed his final shot and had to settle for a five-way tie for second place, while Guy Drut easily won the play-off, and took the money. After this it became a two-way contest between the two pole-vaulters, Isaksson and Seagren.

Controversially, Seagren (by nature of being retired from [[IAAF]] competition) was allowed to run in the track and field events, while Isaksson was not. Seagren later admitted that this gave him a major advantage over his younger, Swedish rival, as running was a fundamental part of any pole-vaulter's training regime, and thus they had to be favoured in such events. While Seagren was unable to win the 100 yard sprint, he did score two points, and his win in the half-mile race gave him a further ten. Isaksson countered with a win in the gym tests and two second-place finishes in the bike race and weightlifting. Seagren however kept competing strongly and his victory in the swimming and second place in the gym tests saw him take a 33 points to 30 lead over Snell and Isaksson into the final event: the obstacle course.

This event was not held in Europe, and therefore Isaksson was attempting it for the first time. In the heats Isaksson ran a time of 25.81 seconds, while Snell was far behind with 29.2 seconds. Seagren however, with much more experience in the event, ran 0.8 seconds faster than the Swede, finishing in 24.64 seconds. His loss in the final to record holder [[Lynn Swann]] was irrelevant; the seven points for second place made him the first World Superstars Champion, and won him $37,000 in the process.

With the Superstars franchise nearing its zenith of popularity, the World Championship returned in 1978 with a 12-man field consisting of the national champions from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the top three finishers from the 1977 European Superstars final, and the top five from the 1978 US National Championship.  Completing the line-up was the returning champion, Bob Seagren.

Though the 1977 runner-up Kjell Isaksson was missing (he would not compete in Superstars again until 1980), Europe was strongly represented by [[Jean-Paul Coche]], [[Keith Fielding]] and [[Ties Kruize]], while [[Wayne Grimditch]], [[Greg Pruitt]] and [[Dwight Stones]] (who could famously jump up the 10-feet high obstacle course wall in one stride) represented the US.  It was the Canadian champion however, [[Brian Budd]], who would completely dominate the contest, and World Superstars for the next three years.

Budd was a strong all-round athlete, his soccer training covering swimming, running, bike racing and gym work.  He also understood that the key to winning Superstars was to win as many points as possible in the events you were good at, and to hold on for as many points as possible in the others.  He turned out to be nearly unbeatable in the gym, half-mile race and the swimming, and more than competent in cycling and rowing.  In 1978 he won 44 points from these five events alone, ten points more than he needed to become World Champion.

In the 100-yard dash, joint favourites Greg Pruitt and Keith Fielding were both unbeaten in the 100 yards/metres, and a fabulous race was in prospect. Budd got off to a blistering start – according to the UK commentator Ron Pickering it was 'a flyer'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxCUOB_m8Cs|title=The Superstars - 1978 World Final - 100 Yards|work=YouTube|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and led in the first 30 yards, but Pruitt, then Fielding accelerated, and the two had a large lead over the rest of the field. As they approached the finish line, Fielding pulled onto Pruitt's shoulder, then leaned as the two crossed the line together.  Without photo-finish equipment the result had to be called from hand-timing only. Fielding was given a time of 9.97 seconds; Pruitt had officially run 9.96. Fielding believed he had won, as did the BBC commentators covering the final. Fielding's challenge was teetering, and in the half-mile run the searing Caribbean heat and a crazy pace he had attempted to catch up with Budd cost him physically; he collapsed of heat exhaustion and had to receive first aid and oxygen from [[Ron Pickering]] at track-side.

Fielding eventually battled on bravely to finish fifth (and top European), but it was Bob Seagren who again gave the strongest challenge.  His consistent performances won him a clear second place, but he was still 14 points behind Budd.  The Canadian had joked and fooled his way through the contest, but it was all a very good act.  He was far and away the best multi-disciplined athlete in the field, and he would prove just as unbeatable in the following two years.

The third World Championship was held in March 1979, again in the sweltering heat of [[Freeport, Bahamas]].  Budd returned as reigning World and Canadian champion (and strong favourite) with Pruitt back as well, but this time as US National Champion.  The European challenge was again restricted by injury and conflicting commitments, and was restricted to three competitors: UK runner-ups [[Lynn Davies]] and [[Dave Boy Green]] and Irish Superstars champion [[Pat Spillane]].  The 1979 European Superstars final had finished with [[Ties Kruize]] and [[Brian Jacks]] joint-winners, but both had missed out on The Bahamas through injury.  If Europe was perhaps under represented, then the US challenge was as formidable as ever, with Pruitt, [[Wayne Grimditch]], [[Jim Taylor (American football)|Jim Taylor]] and [[Joe Theismann]] all qualifying.  Completing the line-up were two invited challengers – not Hemery, Isaksson, Fielding or Kyle Rote though.  Instead the organisers had asked both [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and [[Rafael Septién]] to 'make up the numbers', even though only Fittipaldi had ever entered Superstars before, both in the US and Europe, but neither time with any success.  They did however represent [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]] respectively, and thus increase the media interest in the contest in [[Latin America]].  They would have little impact on the final.

That was not the case for Budd, who dominated again, winning three events comprehensively, setting new records in the swimming and half-mile run in the process.  He also finished third in every other event he competed in, winning the title by thirteen points this time.  While Grimditch and Pruitt won multiple events, they could not match Budd's consistency.  Neither could the best European, Lynn Davies, who finished second in four events but disappointed in the weightlifting and gym tests.  In the end only two points separated second to fourth, with Grimditch beating Pruitt for second on count-back, and Davies two points back in fourth.

Budd had set new standards, and most viewers thought him unbeatable.  There was only one caveat to this victory.  The top Europeans Kruize and Jacks were not present, and with Jacks in particular even more dominant in the gym tests than Budd there were questions asked about what he could have achieved.  They would meet a year later.

==Music==
For the British, European and International version of the show, and in all episodes broadcast in the UK (regardless of where the episode originated) the theme music is "[[Heavy Action]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/06/johnny-pearson-obituary|title=Johnny Pearson obituary|author=Dave Laing|work=the Guardian|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Johnny Pearson]].  The strong association of the theme music to Superstars has led to the music being frequently misidentified as "Superstars",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/johnny-pearson-composer-pianist-and-arranger-who-worked-on-lsquotop-of-the-popsrsquo-during-three-decades-2249980.html|title=Johnny Pearson: Composer, pianist and arranger who worked on &amp;lsquo;Top of the Pops&amp;rsquo; during three decades - Obituaries - News - The Independent|work=The Independent|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it is used in other countries as the theme to other sports events (such as in the United States, where versions of the piece have served as the long-time theme music of the [[NFL]] ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcasts on ABC and later [[ESPN]]).

While not necessarily written specifically for the UK version of Superstars (with Heavy Action instead being written by Pearson for the BBC music library in 1970 while he was working on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''), the music has now become synonymous with both Superstars in the UK, and indeed sport in general, still regularly used by the BBC on sports shows, such as during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

The ABC version in the 1970s and 1980s also used an instrumental version of ''[[Superstar (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|Superstar]]'' from ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' as its theme.

A '''swimsuit competition''', more commonly now called a '''bikini contest''', is a [[beauty pageant|beauty contest]] in which one of the judging criteria is the [[physical attractiveness|physical attributes]] of contestants, which is judged and ranked while contestants wear a [[swimsuit]], typically a [[bikini]].

Bikini contests may be organised or sponsored by related companies for marketing purposes or to try to find and attract new talent to promote their products,&lt;ref name=adage&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/article/sound-vision-music/inside-line-homemade-bikini-contest-marks-12th-year/58172/ |title = Inside Line: Homemade bikini contest marks 12th year |work=Advertising Age |publisher = Crain Communications Inc. |date = May 29, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; masquerading as mild [[adult entertainment]] in the forms of a beauty contest. Swimwear competitions have been a part of [[beauty pageant]]s, such as the [[Miss America]] and [[Miss World]] pageants and by organizations such as [[Hawaiian Tropic]], and may also be held in a bar or nightclub, during intermissions of boxing or wrestling matches or at a car show. Bodybuilding and fitness competitions have evolved to include a bikini division. Participants in such contests may be competing for prizes including trophies, money, and modeling contracts.

== History ==
In the United States, beauty pageants of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as  respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern "[[Miss America]]" contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held.

== Contest organization ==

{{multiple image |
|width1 = 180 |image1 = Blue bikini.jpg
|width2 = 175 |image2 = Jessica Canizales 3.jpg
|footer = Bikini contest in Florida, 2006}}

Public swimsuit competitions are subject to local [[Morality|decency]] laws, which generally require [[nipple]]s and [[labia]] to be covered. More specific standards of dress or [[nudity]] may be determined by the contest organisers. Contestants may be permitted or required to wear certain types of [[bikini]], such as the [[microkini]] (a bikini consisting of a minimal top and [[thong (clothing)|thong]]). Contest organisers may also specify the contestants' age range. In many contests the winners are determined by a panel of judges, but in some cases formal judging is absent and the winner is decided by popular vote. Announcers often present the competition, and they may also help the contestants to connect with the crowd. Winning over the crowd is of principal importance for many competitions, as results can be heavily influenced by audience input.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Bikini contests may be organised or sponsored by related companies for marketing purposes or to try to find and attract new talent to promote their products.&lt;ref name=adage /&gt; [[Miss Hawaiian Tropic]] is organized by [[Playtex]] to promote "[[Hawaiian Tropic]]", its suntan lotion. NOPI runs the annual [[Hot Import Nights]] bikini contest, which is held in conjunction with the import car-show in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and the annual [[Hooter's]] bikini competition.

There are some swimsuit competitions which aim to judge the beauty of a single part of body, such as female [[buttocks]] (for example, the [[Miss Bum Bum]] contest held in Brazil, and the [[Miss Reef]] contest held in several South American countries).&lt;ref name="FTDaily_Mail_October_26_2014c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2718984/Brazils-finest-assets-Country-unveils-27-women-set-compete-annual-Miss-Bum-Bum-contest.html |title=Brazil's finest assets on show: Country unveils the 27 women set to compete in its annual Miss Bum Bum contest |newspaper=Daily Mail |date= August 7, 2014 |author=Sophie Jane Evans |accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Despite their popularity and women's voluntary participation, swimsuit competitions, especially bikini contests, may be controversial. Critics argue that beauty contests reinforce the idea that girls and women are primarily valued for their physical appearance, and that this puts pressure on women to conform to conventional beauty standards by spending time and money on [[fashion]], [[cosmetics]], [[hair styling]] and even [[cosmetic surgery]]. It depletes their bodies of nutrients, energy and even water at the end and expresses a totally unrealistic and unsustainable lifestyle, centered purely around how little fat and how much spray tan they have on. This pursuit of physical beauty even encourages some women to diet to the point of harming themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty and body image in the media|publisher=Media Awareness Network|accessdate=2009-01-17|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118094138/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm|archivedate=18 January 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reigning Miss Universe Suspected of Having Cosmetic Surgery|accessdate=2010-08-23|url=http://cosmeticsurgerytoday.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/reigning-miss-universe-suspected-of-having-cosmetic-surgery/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100826000856/http://cosmeticsurgerytoday.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/reigning-miss-universe-suspected-of-having-cosmetic-surgery/| archivedate= 26 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plastic Surgery: Bollywood, Miss Universe, and the Indian Girl Next Door|publisher=Gujarati Magazine (Sandesh)|accessdate=2010-08-23|url=http://www.shahfacialplastics.com/media/plastic_surgery_bollywood.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miss World contest ===
The first Miss World contest was organized by [[Eric Morley]] in 1951 as a promotion for swimwear at the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= Elissa |last1=Stein |first2=Lee |last2= Meriwether |title=Beauty Queen |page=45 |publisher=Chronicle Books |year= 2006|isbn=0-8118-4864-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan |last= Dewey |title=Making Miss India Miss World|page=46|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year= 2008|isbn=0-8156-3176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press welcomed the spectacle and referred to it as ''Miss World''.&lt;ref name="Keith Lovegrove 1967"&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Lovegrove|title=Pageant: The Beauty Contest|page=1967|publisher=teNeues|year=2002|isbn= 3-8238-5569-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the winner [[Kiki Håkansson]] from Sweden was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. The bikinis were outlawed and [[evening gown]]s introduced instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Han |last=Shin |title=Beauty with a Purpose|page= 193 |publisher=iUniverse|year=2004|isbn= 0-595-30926-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Håkansson remains the only Miss World crowned in a bikini,&lt;ref name="Keith Lovegrove 1967" /&gt; a crowning that was condemned by the [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Selvedge: The Fabric of Your Life|page=39|publisher= Selvedge Ltd. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bikini was banned from Miss World beauty pageants after the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ben |last1=Marcus|first2=Jeff |last2=Divine |title=Surfing USA!: An Illustrated History of the Coolest Sport of All Time |page= 60|publisher=MVP Books|year=2005|isbn= 978-0-89658-690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=magnanti&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnanti|first=Brooke|title=Miss World bikini ban: why it's no victory for feminists|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10105935/Miss-World-2013-bikini-ban-why-its-no-victory-for-feminists.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=22 August 2013 |date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bikinis reappeared in later contests amid additional controversy. In the 1970s and 1980s the contest was regularly picketed by feminist protesters.&lt;ref name=magnanti /&gt; The pageant disappeared for a while and in 1996, when the Miss World contest was held in [[Bangalore]], India, dozens of Indian groups opposed to the event claimed that the contest degraded women by featuring them in bikinis. Social activist Subhashini Ali commented, "It's not an IQ test. Neither is it a charity show. It's a beauty contest in which these things have been added on as sops." The protests were so intense that the organizers were finally compelled to shift the venue of the "Swimsuit Round" to [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/23/miss.world/index.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217161734/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/23/miss.world/index.html |title=Miss Greece now Miss World, despite pageant protests |publisher=CNN |date=23 November 1996 |archivedate= 17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anita |last=Pratap |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/22/india.miss.world/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404132350/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/22/india.miss.world/index.html |title=Indian police prepare for worst in beauty pageant clash  |publisher=CNN|date=22 November 1996 | archivedate= 4 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/17/miss.world/index.html|title= Beauty pageant in India becomes a contest of wills  |first=Anita |last=Pratap |publisher=CNN |date= 17 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countering these claims, the contest organizer says that the organization has raised ₤300 million for charity in many of the countries where it operates since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/10067778/Miss-World-owner-Julia-Morley-How-a-mother-and-housewife-gave-the-beauty-pageant-a-positive-legacy.html  |title=Miss World owner: How a mother and housewife gave the beauty pageant a positive legacy |accessdate=21 August 2013 |date=20 May 2013 |first=Emma |last=Sinclair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Miss World event was hosted by Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country. The country's top Muslim clerical body, the Indonesian Ulema Council, suggested that the event should be cancelled because it promotes "hedonism, materialism, and consumerism," and is nothing but "an excuse to show women's body parts that should remain covered." The organizers later announced that the bikini would be replaced by [[one-piece swimsuit]]s and [[sarong]]s, traditional beachwear on the resort island of [[Bali]]. Pageant Chairwoman Julia Morley explained, "I do not want to upset or get anyone in a situation where we are being disrespectful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss World Beauty Pageant Bans Bikinis|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/06/10/miss-world-beauty-pageant_n_3415087.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 10, 2013|quote=The bikini segment is one of the cornerstones of the Miss World Beauty Pageant but the 2013 event will not be featuring them.

Critics accuse the Miss World organizers of caving to extremist pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Leo|title=Miss World contest cuts bikini round to appease Muslim world|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article3784468.ece|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that Bali is a destination for tourists from across the world who often wear minimal swimwear.&lt;ref name=theweek&gt;{{cite web|title=The controversial bikini ban at the Miss World beauty pageant|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/245346/the-controversial-bikini-ban-at-the-miss-world-beauty-pageant|accessdate=22 August 2013 |first=Harold |last=Maass |date= 7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooke Magnanti argued that the decision to yield to religious fundamentalists was not a victory for [[feminism]]:

{{quote|While no great fan of pageants there's something about this that rubs the wrong way. For some time it's been clear that the interests and tactics of certain types of feminism and certain types of religious fundamentalism not only converge, but seem to complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnanti|first=Brooke|title=Miss World bikini ban: why it's no victory for feminists|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10105935/Miss-World-2013-bikini-ban-why-its-no-victory-for-feminists.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Donald Trump]], who owned the [[Miss Universe]] beauty pageant until it was acquired by [[William Morris Endeavor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenkilloran/2015/09/14/donald-trump-owned-miss-universe-miss-usa-pageants-need-a-network-who-will-bite/|title=Donald Trump Sells Miss Universe, Miss USA Pageants To WME/IMG -- But They Still Need A Network|first=Ellen|last=Killoran|date=14 September 2015|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a competitor to the Miss World contest, was delighted to learn of the rival organization's decision. He told [[Fox TV]], "Well, I own Miss Universe, so I'm actually very happy about it—because if [[Miss World]] doesn't have bikinis their ratings go right down the tubes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Lily|title=Donald Trump Defends Bikini Contests on Miss World Competition|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/428239/donald-trump-defends-bikini-contests-on-miss-world-competition|publisher=E!Online|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 10, 2013|quote=Bikini contests aren't going anywhere if Donald Trump has his way.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally, [[Miss Teen USA]], a Miss Universe pageant, abolished swimsuit competitions in favour of a sportswear competition in 2016.

=== Miss Earth contest ===

[[Vida Samadzai]] was the 2003 Afghani contestant for the [[Miss Earth]] title. She was severely condemned by the both Afghan authorities and community for seeking the title.&lt;ref name=Gersh&gt;Gersh Kuntzman, "[http://gershkuntzman.homestead.com/files/Beauty_is_a_Beast.htm Beauty is a Beast]", ''Newsweek'', 2003-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;  Samadzai was born in Afghanistan but raised in the United States. She was living in India at the time of the contest.&lt;ref name=Fida&gt;Ayesha Matthan, "[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/12/18/stories/2007121850150600.htm Fida over Vida]", ''The Hindu'', 2007-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Afghan Supreme Court]] banned swimsuit contests and said that appearing naked in beauty contests is completely un-Islamic, and is against Afghan tradition, human honour and dignity. [[Habiba Sarabi]], the Afghan women affairs minister, said Samadzai's  semi-naked appearance "is not women's freedom but in my opinion is to entertain men". Afghanistan's embassy in Washington DC declared that claims by [[Afghan American]] Samadzai to represent Afghanistan is baseless.&lt;ref&gt;News desk, "[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=126&amp;art_id=qw1067503501825B212&amp;set_id=1 Afghan Supreme Court bans beauty pageants]", ''Independent Online'', 2003-09-30&lt;/ref&gt; Samadzai, the second woman to be crowned Miss Afghanistan after [[Zohra Daoud]]'s crowning in 1972, received a number of death threats and had to be under the protection of [[FBI]] for three months.&lt;ref name=Gersh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farhad J. Dadyburjor, "[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1049966 I was under FBI's watch for 3 months: Miss Afghanistan]", ''Daily News and Analysis'', 2006-06-29&lt;/ref&gt; She said she was a bit uncomfortable wearing the "70s style red bikini" and was aware of the risks involved.&lt;ref name=Fida /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;News Desk, "[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19308457_ITM Miss Afghanistan says she was uncomfortable wearing bikini, goal is to help women and children back home]", ''Financial Times'', 2003-11-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimi Yoshino, "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-87832327.html Causing a stir, all because of a bikini]", ''Times New Service '', 2003-11-28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children's bikini contest ===
''Miss Tanguita'', which translates as "Miss Child Bikini", is held in Barbosa, Santader, [[Colombia]] as annual part of the "del Rio Suarez" Festival. The organisers deny the allegations that the competition is a camouflage for sexual exploitation, and instead describe it as an awareness event about the importance of children's fitness. Activists say that the competition, though legal, abuses the human rights of minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pekanbaru.tribunnews.com/2015/01/14/wah-kontes-ratu-bikini-anak-anak-digelar-di-negara-ini |title=Wah, Kontes Ratu Bikini Anak-anak Digelar di Negara Ini |author=Raya Desmawanto Nainggolan |date=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miss Teen USA ===
Beginning in 2016, the Miss Teen USA pageant removed the swimsuit competition and replaced it with an athleticwear round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/shows/total_divas/news/781840/first-look-see-what-miss-teen-usa-contestants-will-wear-instead-of-bikinis|title=First Look!

A '''talent show''' is an event in which participants [[performing arts|perform the arts]] of [[singing]], [[dancing]], [[lip sync|lip-syncing]], [[acting]], [[martial arts]], playing an [[musical instrument|instrument]], or other activities to showcase [[skill]]s. Many talent shows are performances rather than contests, but some are actual contests. In the instance of a contest, participants may be motivated to perform for a reward, trophy, or prize of some kind. For example, a [[high school]] might not have many students with any interest in performing in front of the student body for the sole purpose of performing alone and may offer different prizes as an incentive for these students to participate in the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parke |first=Beverly N. |title=Discovering Programs for Talent Development |year=2003 |publisher=Corwin Press |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |isbn=978-0-7619-4613-7|pages=131–32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71ysy1gOEcMC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22talent%20shows%22&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

Since the late 1980s, talent shows have become a notable genre of [[reality television]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Redden|first=Guy|title=Exposing Lifestyle Television: The Big Reveal|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4094-9286-3|pages=129–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YNJN-tolIwEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22talent+show%22&amp;ots=I7uqlYNPUs&amp;sig=jQ6A2VBPiX_e2DB63bJI0mzSx4o#v=onepage&amp;q=%22talent%20show%22&amp;f=false|chapter=Making Over the Talent Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Notun Kuri]]'' (1976), ''[[Popstars]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Academy]]'' (2001), [[Idols (TV series)|''Idol'']] (2001), ''[[The X Factor]]'' (2004), ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'' (2005), ''[[Got Talent]]'' (2006), ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'' (2010), ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' (2013), ''[[Tri Akkorda (Russian Talent Show)]] (2014)'' and ''[[The Four: Battle for Stardom]] (''2018'')'', which have been critical in catapulting some amateur artists to stardom and resulting in their commercially successful careers.

==Non-competitive talent shows for troubled youths==
Talent shows can be seen as a way to help boost the self-esteem, confidence, and assurance of youth. Some communities and companies see talent shows as a way to help prevent [[juvenile delinquency]] among children, teens, and young adults. As a result, these communities create programs such as ''Girls Only!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only! Toolkit|url=http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|website=San Diego District Attorney's Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528165206/http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[San Diego]] to promote the growth of these otherwise trouble youth to better the community. Such programs are created with the hope to prevent youth from the possibilities of entering delinquency or lives of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only! Toolkit|url=http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/index.html|website=San Diego District Attorney's Office|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fairly OddParents''''' is an American [[animated television series]] created by [[Butch Hartman]] that originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from March 30, 2001, to July 26, 2017. The series follows the everyday misadventures of [[Timmy Tiberius Turner|Timmy Turner]], a boy who is granted two fairy godparents named Cosmo and Wanda. It was produced by [[Nelvana]] (2001–2004), [[Frederator Studios]], [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]s and [[Billionfold Inc.]] (2008–2017).

The series originated from shorts on the animation showcase, ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'', airing from 1998 to 2001. It was later picked up as a series due to its popularity. Originally, it ended in 2006 totaling five seasons, but resumed production in 2008. The series was cancelled after the 10th season.

==Overview==
Set in the fictional town of Dimmsdale, California, a 10-year-old boy named Timmy Turner is neglected by his parents and tortured by his babysitter Vicky. One day, he is granted two fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who grant his every wish to improve his miserable life. However, these wishes are guaranteed to inadvertently cause a series of technical problems that Timmy must fix. In the beginning of the series, Timmy's babysitter Vicky was the main antagonist. As the series progressed, more villains were included; for example, his teacher, Mr. Crocker, firmly believes in fairy godparents and has been searching for them a very long time, correctly suspecting that Timmy has fairy godparents. He is dangerous to Timmy because, according to ''Da Rules'', a large rulebook that defines what children can and cannot wish for and how fairy godparents must behave, no one else can know about his fairy godparents and they will be taken away if this happens (although they don't remember, Cosmo and Wanda once used to be Crocker's fairy godparents, as this rule does not apply to people who currently have their own or once had fairy godparents).

At his school, Timmy is often bullied by Francis, a vicious boy who claims to be the toughest student in school, but reveals to Timmy that he only takes out his anger on him because of his rough home life and abusive parents. Jorgen Von Strangle, the enormous and tough head fairy with an [[Austrian accent]], similar to that of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], personally dislikes Timmy and his fairies at first, but at times he has to assist them in fixing their problems.

Later in the series, Timmy wished that Cosmo and Wanda would have a baby, whom they named Poof. More recently, Timmy got a pet fairy dog named Sparky. Also introduced is the premise that for every fairy, there is also an anti-fairy. The anti-fairies are similar to the real ones, but with opposite personalities and character traits. For example, Anti-Cosmo is intelligent and speaks with an [[British English|English accent]] while real Cosmo is dim-witted. Similarly, Anti-Wanda is also dim-witted and speaks with a [[Southern United States English|Southern American accent]] while real Wanda is intelligent. When Poof was born, his anti-fairy was created. Anti-Poof's name is Foop (Poof spelled backwards). While Poof is spherical, Foop is shaped like a cube. Foop's goal in life is to cause mayhem and destroy his nemesis Poof.

Even later in the series, Timmy is informed that due to a shortage of available fairies, he must now share Cosmo and Wanda with his new neighbor, Chloe Carmichael, who is essentially his polar opposite. She loves sharing, animals, and everything that is ecologically friendly.

==Setting==
''The Fairly OddParents'' is set in the fictional city of Dimmsdale, California. The city appears to be average-sized, with a downtown containing large buildings and a city hall but also containing uptown areas with residences (including the house where Timmy and his parents and godparents live) and businesses (including Timmy's school; a hospital; stores; a sports complex named the Dimmadome, named after its founder and owner; the local TV channel; and various restaurants and stores) as well as a park in the center of the city. The city also appears to have rural farmland located somewhere outside of the city. The adults in the city are notably moronic and often settle situations with things like angry mobs, but they do still form a structured and complex society capable of working as a city. In the episode "Which Witch is Which", it was revealed that Dimmsdale was founded in the 1630s after Dale Dimm managed to defeat a witch hunter who was secretly a witch named Alden Biterroot (a possible ancestor of Denzel Crocker).

When the show needs to, it switches its location to Fairy World, the magical realm and home of the fairies which is a floating world located within the sky and colored with an abundance of pink. The fairies have a civilization like that of the humans, but with a source of power being magic, which also keeps the world afloat. A large rainbow acts as the bridge between Fairy World and the Earth. Another location sometimes seen is the city of Chincinatti, the home town of Timmy's favorite comic book superhero, the Crimson Chin. Other locations include the dark and twisted Anti-Fairy World, the dark counterpart of Fairy World where the anti-fairies live; the dull and gray metropolis of Pixies Inc., home of the pixies; and Yugopotamia, where an alien, Mark Chang, lives, who is also Timmy's friend.

==Production history==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
[[File:Butch Hartman by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|175px|Butch Hartman, the series' creator]]

===Origins (1998–2001)===
{{further|The Fairly OddParents shorts}}
[[File:The Fairly OddParents postcard 1998.jpg|thumb|left|A postcard for ''The Fairly OddParents'' segment on Nickelodeon's ''Oh Yeah! Cartoons'']]

''The Fairly OddParents'' was originally pitched to [[Cartoon Network]]. The pilot was never shown to Cartoon Network, but it was pitched while show creator Butch Hartman was working on Cartoon Network's ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', and ''[[I Am Weasel]]''. The show's pilot was not actually made until the show was pitched to Nick.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.imgrum.net/media/1223543557151819817_1926039129|title=Fairly Odd Parents was originally pitched to Cartoon Network. -- The pilot was never shown to Cartoo - nicktoonsfactss|website=imgrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=March 2018}} Creator/Producer Butch Hartman originally created ''The Fairly OddParents'' as a seven-minute [[short film]] entitled ''Fairy Godparents'', one of 39 short cartoons in the first season of [[Fred Seibert]]'s ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]''. Butch Hartman made six more short films for the show in season 3. Nickelodeon agreed to a seven episode order (consisting of two 11-minute segments) of "The Fairly Oddparents", which began airing on March 30, 2001, in the half-hour after fellow Nicktoon ''[[Invader Zim]]''.

Unlike the half-hour series, the animation in the shorts is not as smooth, and the designs are notably different (including Timmy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who are only seen from the neck down with their faces hidden in the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]]s and appear to be more intelligent than they appeared to be in the proceeding series, yet still easily duped by Vicky's abhorrent actions). Other notable differences include the voices like Timmy Turner, who was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] instead of Tara Strong. Cosmo is significantly more intelligent than he appears to be in the proceeding series. Wanda is shown to be less intelligent and less of a nag. Vicky is much less evil than in the current series. She also calls Timmy by his name as opposed to the more often used "twerp".

Originally, Hartman wanted Timmy to wear a blue hat, but since it would blend in with the walls of the bedroom, he decided to make it pink. Wanda was originally going to be named "Venus", but instead named her Wanda. Her middle name was and still is "Venus."

===Original run (2001–2006)===
[[File:Fairly OddParents Title Card.jpg|thumb|The title card of the show (Season 9)]]

''The Fairly OddParents'' was immediately popular, greatly increasing its lead-in rating from ''Invader Zim''. In fact, no matter what time slot Nickelodeon placed the show in, Nick's ratings soared. The series attracted a wider than anticipated audience, appealing to all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keveney|first=Bill|title='OddParents' looks fairly successful|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-10-28-oddparents_x.htm|accessdate=November 17, 2012|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=October 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later Nickelodeon's highest rated show. Early 2002 and 2003 was the first peak of popularity for ''The Fairly OddParents''. Its ratings skyrocketed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=PETROZZELLO|first=DONNA|title='Oddparents' Casts A Spell|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-11-11/entertainment/18212267_1_oddparents-nickelodeon-cartoons|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 11, 2002}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series appeared in a $50 [[Best Western]] travel card during summer 2006 and again in summer 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRESS RELEASE: Best Western Celebrates Summer With Top-Rated Kids' Networks, Nickelodeon and YTV, Launching Promotion With ''The Fairly Oddparents''|url=http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read/2575033/best_western_celebrates_summer_with_top|work=boston.com|publisher=[[Best Western]]|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theatrical film based on the series was planned for release by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]], but it was eventually dropped because of [[Viacom_(original)#2005_split|a management change at Paramount]], although the script was written. Hartman stated on his website&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butchhartman.com|title=Butch Hartman Web site}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he would like to release the film on DVD one day, but there were not definitive plans to do so.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

On January 24, 2006, Butch Hartman announced on his forum&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://butchhartman.com/forumIII/index.php?showtopic=7072|title=butchhartman.com|work=butchhartman.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; that [[Nickelodeon]] had ceased production of the show. "The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators" was intended to be the fifth-season finale and [[series finale]] in production order, airing on July 21, 2006. However, Nickelodeon broadcast the episode "Timmy the Barbarian/No Substitute for Crazy" after "The Jerkinators" as the fifth-season finale, on November 25 of that year.

===Revival (2007–2011)===
Hartman announced on his forum&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://butchhartman.com/forumIII/index.php?showtopic=12732|title=butchhartman.com|work=butchhartman.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; on February 2, 2007, that Nick granted ''Fairly OddParents'' twenty more episode slots, making sure the show resumed production. Later on July 7, "77 Secrets of the Fairly OddParents Revealed" hinted that a new character would join the series.

After a one-year hiatus, [[Nickelodeon]] announced on TV that they would begin the broadcast of a [[television movie]] called ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]'' as the beginning of at least 20 episodes of Season 6, and to carry the show to at least the year 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frederatorblogs.com/odd/2007/12/20/the-oddparents-are-coming-the-oddparents-are/|title=The OddParents are coming the OddParents are coming}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge hit, ''Fairly OddBaby'' aired on February 18, 2008, becoming the top entertainment program across broadcast and basic cable TV for the year among kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bynum|first=Aaron|title=Nick: 'Fairly OddBaby' Ratings|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1634|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=Animation Insider|date=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live-action films and end of the show (2011–2017)===
{{see also|The Fairly OddParents (film series)}}

On March 14, 2012, the series was renewed for [[The Fairly OddParents (season 9)|a ninth season]] with new episodes that were scheduled to broadcast that year.&lt;ref name="upfront2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.viacom.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=657348|title=Nickelodeon Unveils Plans at Annual Upfront for More than 650 New Episodes Across Every Genre (NYSE:VIAB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the second live action film, ''[[A Fairly Odd Christmas]]'', aired in November 2012. The ninth season premiered the same day as the 2013 Kids Choice Awards. The ninth season introduced another character, Timmy's fairy dog, Sparky. Season nine is also the first season to be formatted in [[High-definition video|high definition]] and [[widescreen]]. In 2013, it was announced there would be a third installment called ''[[A Fairly Odd Summer]]'' with Drake Bell and Daniella Monet reprising their respective roles. The movie premiered on August 2, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubcp.com/wp-content/uploads/Sept-12-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New episodes were confirmed by Fred Seibert on April 11, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredseibert.frederator.com/post/116119585607/ok-were-incredibly-excited-for-butch-hartman|title=Fred Seibert's Tumblr|work=frederator.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2015, a tenth season was announced, and introduced another character, Chloe Carmichael, Timmy's new neighbor who also has Cosmo and Wanda as her fairy godparents. The tenth season aired from January 15, 2016, to July 26, 2017, on both [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]].

== Failed spin-off and theatrical/direct to video film==
In 2004, [[Butch Hartman]] revealed his intentions to make a ''Crash Nebula'' spin-off. The pilot episode "Crash Nebula" was aired as part of the [[The Fairly OddParents (season 4)|show's fourth season]]. Despite this, [[Nickelodeon]] decided to not pick up the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manic-expression.com/top-5-rejected-nickelodeon-shows-or-pilots-that-should-never-be-made/|title=Top 5 Rejected Nickelodeon Shows or Pilots That Should Never Be Made|date=20 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006, Hartman stated that he was confident and would try to get the spin-off greenlighted in the future. He also wrote a script entitled ''Crash Nebula: The Movie'' for [[Paramount Pictures]], but the film was cancelled due to its similarities with Disney's ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-fairly-oddparents/crash-nebula-321929/trivia/|title=The Fairly OddParents: Crash Nebula|first=|last=TV.com|website=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 or 2006, Butch Hartman had also considered making a theatrical adaptation of his animated television series ''The Fairly OddParents'' after the show's initial cancellation in 2006, produced by [[Nickelodeon Movies]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was to be animated much like the series as well as previous Nickelodeon fare such as the [[Rugrats (film series)|''Rugrats'' film series]] and ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', but was scrapped due to [[Viacom (original)#2005 split|a management change at Paramount]] although the script was already written. Despite this, Hartman expressed interest in releasing the film [[Direct-to-video|for DVD]] someday, and stated that the script could serve for another [[TV movie]] of the show. However, with the show's cancellation on July 26, 2017 and Butch Hartman's decision to leave Nickelodeon in early 2018&lt;ref name="leave1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-978368492/why-i-left-nickelodeon|via=SoundCloud|accessdate=February 10, 2018|date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leave2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4faDISwSVo|via=YouTube|accessdate=February 9, 2018|date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it seemingly ends any chances of that happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/butch-hartman-pocketwatch-hobbykidstv-1202584593/|title=‘Fairly OddParents’ Creator Butch Hartman Developing Three Series With Startup Pocket.watch|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=17 October 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
During its original 5–season run, the series received immensely positive reviews despite some criticism for focusing solely on child-based humor while other Nickelodeon shows such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' included adult-based humor and dark humor.

Despite concerns about if the show would [[jump the shark]], the introduction of the character Poof in "[[Fairly OddBaby]]" was well received. Seasons 6 through 8 received positive reviews even as several possible finales such as the "[[Wishology]]" Trilogy and "Timmy's Secret Wish" airing with the show continuing afterwards.

The introduction of the character Sparky in season 9 was heavily criticized with the character being deemed unnecessary and annoying. His introduction, seen as an attempt to increase ratings, has been compared to the character [[Scrappy-Doo]] in the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise. As a result, his character was removed for season 10.

'''''The Storming of the Winter Palace''''' was a 1920 [[Spectacle|mass spectacle]], based on historical events that took place in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] during the 1917 [[October Revolution]].
[[File:Stormningen av vinterpalatset.jpg|thumb|Heavily retouched scene from the spectacle of 1920. This photograph was presented from 1922 on in many publications as an authentic depiction of the events, both in Russia and internationally.]]
Taking place on the third anniversary of the revolution, it was directed by [[Nikolai Evreinov]] and was subtitled a "mass action." The sets were designed by [[Yuri Annenkov]]. The spectacle was staged outside the former Tsarist [[Winter Palace]] where the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] was meeting at the time of the [[Bolshevik]] revolution. Its performers included 125 ballet dancers, 100 circus people, 1,750 supernumeraries and students, 200 women, 260 secondary actors, and 150 assistants. There were also tanks and armoured cars involved.

The mass spectacle form took the pre-revolutionary [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] utopias of "ritual theatre" (whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 revolution]]), and recast their "people" as the [[proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleberg (1980, 44-64).&lt;/ref&gt; Performed on 7 November before 100,000 spectators, the action begins with the [[February Revolution]], follows the gradual organization of the workers (on a [[Red Army|red stage]] to the left, with [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] and the Provisional Government on a [[White movement|white stage]] to the right), until they are illuminated fully by searchlights, and crying "[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], Lenin" charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the "Whites." Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape, and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets, to the Palace. Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace, until the Red Army is finally successful, and red lights flash out. A cannon fired from the cruiser ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]'' and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution. 

==Influence==

Evreinov's dramatic creation was extremely influential in the commemoration of the deposition of the Provisional Government, which in reality took place at night and was much less dramatic than depicted either in Evreinov's spectacle or in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s feature film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' (1927). One of the over 100 surviving photographs from the spectacle, pictured above, was presented from 1922 on in many Soviet and also foreign publications as an authentic image from the events of 1917. For this purpose, the picture was heavily [[Photo manipulation|retouched]], with the spectators on the right and a tower-like construction for directing the participants removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturstiftung-des-bundes.de/cms/de/mediathek/magazin/magazin28/sasse/index.html Sylvia Sasse: Retusche=Attacke. Oder: Wie Geschichte durch Theater repariert wurde. ''Kulturstiftung des Bundes. Das Magazin #28. 2017/2.]&lt;/ref&gt; The image is sometimes also misinterpreted as a [[film still]] from ''October'', though the "storming" in the film is set (historically correctly) at night, not during the day as in the photograph.

'''''Tractatus coislinianus''''' is an ancient Greek manuscript outlining a theory of [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] in the tradition of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

==Dramatic theory==
The ''Tractatus'' states that comedy invokes laughter and pleasure, thus purging those emotions ([[catharsis]]), in a manner parallel to the description of [[tragedy]] in the ''Poetics''. It proceeds to describe the devices used and manner in which [[catharsis]] is brought about.

==History==
The manuscript now resides in [[Paris, France]], at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]]; it is labeled "Coislinianus 120". The 10th-century manuscript resided at [[Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]]. In 1643, [[Athanasius Rhetor]] sent it from [[Cyprus]] to [[Pierre Séguier|Séguier de Coislin]]. The classicist [[J. A. Cramer]], poring through the collection of [[Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin]], was struck by the content, believing it to be the work of a commentator on Aristotle's theory of comedy, and published it in 1839. This belief was soon derided, but it has gained force in the 20th century; [[Richard Janko]] has argued that it is the notes or sketches of the lost second section of the ''Poetics''. Nesselrath argues that it is a later work, perhaps by [[Theophrastus]].

A '''video game producer''' is the person in charge of overseeing  [[game development|development]] of a [[video game]].&lt;ref name="manliness" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

==History==
The earliest documented use of the term ''producer'' in games was by [[Trip Hawkins]], who established the position when he founded [[Electronic Arts]] in 1982. Hawkins said in 1983:

{{quote|Producers basically manage the relationship with the artist. They find the talent, work out product deals, get contracts signed, manage them, and bring them to their conclusion. The producers do most of the things that a product manager does. They don't do the marketing, which in some cases product managers do. They don't make decisions about packaging and merchandising, but they do get involved ... they're a little like book editors, a little bit like film producers, and a lot like product managers.&lt;ref name="byte198310"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n95/mode/2up | title=Shaping Consumer Software | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=30 January 2015 |author1=Lemmons, Phil |author2=Robertson, Barbara | pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sierra On-Line]]'s 1982 computer game ''[[Time Zone (computer game)|Time Zone]]'' may be the first to list credits for "Producer" and "Executive Producer".&lt;ref name="maher20150416"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2015/04/defender-of-the-crown/ | title=Defender of the Crown | publisher=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2015-04-16 | accessdate=16 April 2015 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 1983 Electronic Arts had five producers: A product marketer and two others from Hawkins' former employer Apple ("good at working with engineering people"), one former IBM salesman and executive recruiter, and one product marketer from [[Automated Simulations]];{{r|byte198310}} it popularized the use of the title in the industry.{{r|maher20150416}} Hawkins' vision—influenced by his relationship with [[Jerry Moss]]—was that producers would manage [[A&amp;R|artists and repertoire]] in the same way as in the music business, and Hawkins brought in [[record producer]]s from [[A&amp;M Records]] to help train those first producers. [[Activision]] made [[Brad Fregger]] their first producer in April 1983.

Although the term is an industry standard today, it was dismissed as "imitation Hollywood" by many game executives and press members at the time.  Over its entire history, the role of the video game producer has been defined in a wide range of ways by different companies and different teams, and there are a variety of positions within the industry referred to as ''producer''.

There are relatively few superstars of game production that parallel those in film, in part because top producers are usually employed by publishers who choose to play down publicizing their contributions.  Unlike many of their counterparts in film or music, these producers do not run their own independent companies.

== Types of producers ==
Most video and computer games are developed by [[video game developer|third-party developers]]. In these cases, there may be external and internal producers. External producers may act as "executive producers" and are employed by the game's [[video game publisher|publisher]].  Internal producers work for the developer itself and have more of a hands-on role. Some game developers may have no internal producers, however, and may rely solely on the publisher's producer.

For an internal producer, associate producers tend to specialize in an area of expertise depending on the team they are producing for and what skills they have a background in. These specializations include but are not limited to: programming, design, art, sound, and quality assurance. A normal producer is usually the project manager and is in charge of delivering the product to the publisher on time and on budget.&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;  An executive producer will be managing all of the products in the company and making sure that the games are on track to meet their goals and stay within the company's goals and direction.

For an external producer, their job responsibilities may focus mainly on overseeing several projects being worked on by a number of developers.  While keeping updated on the progress of the games being developed externally, they inform the upper management of the publisher of the status of the pending projects and any problems they may be experiencing.  If a publisher's producer is overseeing a game being developed internally, their role is more akin to that of an internal producer and will generally only work on one game or a few small games.

As games have grown larger and more expensive, [[line producer]]s have become part of some teams.  Based on filmmaking traditions, line producers focus on project scheduling and costing to ensure titles are completed on time and on budget.

== Responsibilities ==
An internal producer is heavily involved in the development of, usually, a single game.  Responsibilities for this position vary from company to company, but in general, the person in this position has the following duties:&lt;ref name="manliness" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;
* Negotiating contracts, including [[license|licensing]] deals
* Acting as a liaison between the development staff and the upper stakeholders (publisher or executive staff)
* Developing and maintaining schedules and budgets
* Overseeing creative (art and [[video game design|design]]) and technical development ([[game programming]]) of the game
* Ensuring timely delivery of deliverables (such as [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]])
* Scheduling timely [[quality assurance]] ([[game tester|testing]])
* Arranging for [[beta test]]ing and [[focus group]]s, if applicable
* Arranging for [[Internationalization and localization|localization]]
* Pitching game ideas to publishers

In short, the internal producer is ultimately responsible for timely delivery and final quality of the game.

For small games, the producer may interact directly with the programming and creative staff. For larger games, the producer will seek the assistance of the [[game programmer|lead programmer]], art lead, [[game designer]] and testing lead. While it is customary for the producer to meet with the entire development staff from time to time, for larger games, they will only meet with the leads on a regular basis to keep updated on the development status.&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt; In smaller studios, a producer may fill any slack in the production team by doing the odd job of writing the game manual or producing game assets.&lt;ref name="manliness" /&gt;

For most games, the producer does not have a large role but does have some influence on the development of the [[video game design]]. While not a game designer, the producer has to weave the wishes of the publisher or upper management into the design. They usually seek the assistance of the game designer in this effort. So the final game design is a result the effort of the designer and some influence of the producer.&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

In general, the producer is not the "boss" of the people on the game development team, but the "boss" of the game.  So while a programmer may answer to a programming director, where matters of the game are involved, they answer to the producer.  Producers may issue reprimands or issue accolades, but usually the fate of the developer's employment is not in the hands of the producer.  So while they may suggest termination or promotions of certain employees, the producer normally cannot fire or promote team members single-handedly.

== Compensation ==
In general, video game producers earn the third most out of game development positions, behind business ([[marketing]]/management) and programmers.
According to an annual survey of salaries in the industry, producers earn an average of [[United States dollar|USD]]$75,000 annually.  A video game producer with less than 3 years of experience makes, on average, around $55,000 annually. A video game producer with more than 6 years of experience makes, on average, over $125,000 annually. The salaries of a video game producer will vary depending on the region and the studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/  "Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries"]. [http://www.bigfishgames.com/ Big Fish Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Most video game producers complete a bachelor's degree program in game design, computer science, digital media or business. Popular computer programming languages for video game development include C, C++, Assembly and Java. Some common courses are communications, mathematics, accounting, art, digital modeling and animation.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Employers typically require three plus years of experience, since a producer has to have gone through the development cycle several times to really understand how unpredictable the business is. The most common path to becoming a video game producer begins by first working as a game tester, then moving up the quality assurance ladder, and then eventually on to production. This is easier to accomplish if one stays with the same studio, reaping the benefits of having built relationships with the production department.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}
'''Winter guard''' is an indoor [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] sport derived from military ceremonies or veterans organizations ceremonies. Unlike traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]], Winter Guard is performed indoors, usually in a gymnasium or an indoor arena. Performances make use of recorded music rather than a live band or orchestra. Winter guard was invented in the United States, which remains the predominant scene for the sport.

Winter Guard ensembles commonly perform at judged competitions officiated by local and regional associations using criteria developed by [[Winter Guard International]]. In most states, they have a cadet guard and high school guard.

==Team roles==

A Winter Guard generally consists of performing members under the direction of an instructional staff. The staff of a winter guard team ("the guard") are drawn from many different specialties, which sometimes overlap: there are equipment instructors (sometimes one for the unit, sometimes broken out into the individual sections), dance instructors, and drill instructors. The equipment instructors create the choreography performed with equipment and teach it to the guard. The dance instructors create and teach the movement [[choreography]] in the show. The drill instructors focus on the position of the guard members relative to one another and to the boundaries of the performance area, in addition to where each member goes at which specific time during the performance. In some cases, all of these roles are fulfilled by one sole director.

A winter guard team usually has a captain, who is one of the performing members who leads and represents the guard. The captain may assume minor administrative duties and lead the team when instructors are not available. The captain is also the representative of the guard during awards ceremonies or retreat.

The number of members on a winter guard team varies widely from five to approximately 45.

==Performance conventions==

The duration of winter guard shows depends on the class in which the guard is performing. In competition settings, each winter guard team is allotted a set amount of time to set up staging (including a vinyl floor if the guard is using one, and any props associated with the performance), place all equipment, perform the show, and remove staging, props, and equipment. Setup and tear-down typically run two minutes each, and performances run around five minutes. Judges impose penalties on teams that run past the allotted time.

Unlike traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)]] teams, which perform outdoors on a football field or parade route accompanied by a [[marching band]] or [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum corps]], winter guard teams perform indoors to recorded music.

In competitions, winter guard teams are judged in the areas of talent, precision, creativity, and horizontal orchestration (how all the elements create the larger picture/effect). Performances incorporate equipment, props, and dance moves.

Judges must keep a running commentary on a tape recorder or digital recorder. The judges record the score on a designated sheet to be reviewed by the individual guard instructor(s). After every one in a class has competed and their scores have been tallied, if the instructor(s) so choose they may meet with all the judges to discuss in depth why they received the score they did, ways to improve, what they are doing right etc. The goal of all parties involved, is to have the performers, staff, and the programs grow and learn.

==Equipment==

Three primary types of equipment are used in winter guard: flags, rifles, and sabres (other items can be used to demonstrate artistic effects.) Such equipment is used in shows to demonstrate a team's technical ability. Rubber tape, such as electrical tape, is often used to cover the equipment and give it a uniform appearance and protect it from damage during the activity.

===Flags===

The most fundamental piece of equipment in color guard or winter guard shows is the flag. While winter guard flags take many different sizes and shapes, a standard size is a six-foot pole (metal) with a Three-foot "silk", often of a custom design. Smaller flags called "swing flags" are shortened poles with large silks connected to them. These poles are often plastic so they move more fluidly. These flags are often incorporated into the artistic element of the performance, even though they are not practical for tossing or spinning, due to the weight and length of the silk. Other flags may range from 5 feet to 7 feet depending upon the intended effect of the piece of equipment. Longer flags are not practical to spin or toss but generally serve as holders for large pieces of material.

===Rifles===

Shaped similar to actual [[rifle|rifles]], the rifles used in winter guard are made of solid or hollowed-out lightweight wood and weigh 2&amp;ndash;5 pounds (about 1&amp;ndash;2.25 kilograms). Most winter guard rifles have a length of 30&amp;ndash;39 inches (about 76&amp;ndash;99 centimeters) and are composed of seven parts:
# The '''neck''' of the rifle. The neck is where the trigger would be on a firearm rifle. Right-handed drop-spins are performed using the neck of the rifle as the axis for the spin, and the neck is also used in common tosses.
# The '''bolt''' is a long silver or black strip of metal or plastic connected to the body of the rifle by screws, made to look like the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] on a firearm.
# The '''body''' of the rifle is the middle section and the majority of the mass of the rifle.
# The '''strap''', a long [[leather]] strap that reaches from the butt end of the rifle to about two-thirds of the way to the nose of the rifle. The strap has functional and visual purposes, and it is also used to produce a snapping sound. The strap is similar to a firearm's sling.
# The '''swivel''' or '''clip''' is the metal piece that attaches the strap to the body of the rifle. This is the most common location for left-hand placement when executing a regular left-handed toss.
# The final part of the rifle is the '''butt''', the heavier, back end of the rifle.
# The "tip" is at the end of the thin, long part of the rifle and is located on the opposite side of where the "butt" is.

Rifles can be made out of both [[wood]] and [[plastic]]. Some people prefer plastic because they are all the same weight and size, unless you order a bigger or smaller one. Others prefer wood because they're heavier and more durable. They are all exactly the same. Some people prefer wood because it is less slick and they can weight it the way they want to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/.|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plastic Rifles ====
Usually rookies, people new to color guard, will use plastic rifles. They tend to be a little more forgiving and easier to handle. Some people may not like plastic rifles because they can become slick and hard to handle, either when its raining or just from the sweat from the users hands. Some plastic rifles come with a manufacture guarantee that they will not break under normal usage. Because most are made out of a material called [[polyethylene]], this makes the rifle sturdy and harder to break. The material can also be colored so that different teams can use different colored rifles. Sometimes, though, the material can warp after several bad drops which can lead to a bad spin while the rifle is in the air. Plastic rifles may also start to smell after prolonged use, some say that after a long time it will tend to smell like sweat because of the performers hands. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/.|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wooden Rifles ====
Wooden rifles can be hard to use because they are all slightly different and may not be weighted the same, this is why people that are more familiar with rifles use them and not usually rookies. Most wooden rifles are made of either [[Populus|poplar]] or [[aspen]] wood. It is recommended to tape wooden rifles as to keep the ends protected and make it more durable, the tape can also be used for cosmetics. [[Electrical tape]] is the first choice of most winter guards because you can get the tape in whatever color is desired to match the show. Water is the main antagonist to wooden rifles, it can destroy a rifle and make it completely not usable, but if cared for properly and used correctly they can last for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabres===

[[Sabre]]s are elegant pieces of equipment used in winter guard. The length of sabres can range from about 30&amp;ndash;39 inches (about 76&amp;ndash;99 centimeters). They can either be plastic, metal, or plastic covered metal- though metal is more commonly used. Some metal sabres on the market are intricately decorated with engravings or etchings along the blade.  These more intricately designed sabres tend to be more expensive.

Sabres have two main parts: the blade and the hilt. The blade has a pointed but dull end, and the length of the blade is dull as well. Some winter guard team members wrap their sabres in electrical tape, as they do with rifles. As with rifles, a piece of black or non-white tape placed near the center of rotation is used as a "spotter", making it easier to locate the fast-moving blade while it is rotating in the air. Sabres are used primarily by more advanced guard members.

==Dance==

[[File:Winter Guard Preview Show 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|2012 Winter Guard Preview Show]]Guard members incorporate many different styles of dance into their shows. The most common styles of dance used are modern, contemporary, lyrical, jazz, and ballet. The different styles of dance are chosen depending on the different types of music chosen and the themes of the shows.  Dance is usually incorporated into the equipment work, and is performed seamlessly throughout the show.

==Winter Guard International==

[[Winter Guard International]] is not only a national competition but it is also an organization that has been around for many years. Unlike other traditional sports the rules and regulations have been changed and altered many times since the activity has started. There are judges who judge separate elements of a show – such as general effect, movement, equipment, and penalty points – and score the groups accordingly.

Because this activity not only exists in the United States but all around the world, major competitions worldwide are sanctioned and managed by Winter Guard International. This is the governing organization that makes and changes the rules and regulations for this activity. The rules that are written by WGI apply to every Winter Guard group competing in the World Championships no matter what country they are from. The World Championships are held every year in the United States. Most recently they have been held at the [[UD Arena|
University of Dayton Arena]] in Dayton, Ohio with some prelims and semi-finals held elsewhere around the Dayton area and Cincinnati area.

The phrase "Sport of the Arts" is frequently associated with WGI. Winter guard is described by saying "it brings music to life through performance in a competitive format."

==Divisions and classes==

Because not every color guard has the same skill level, population, or resources available, WGI uses a class division system to help remedy this.  There are two divisions, '''Scholastic''' and '''Independent'''.  These divisions include the classes (in descending order) Independent: Independent World Class, Independent Open Class, Independent A Class. Scholastic: Scholastic World,  Scholastic Open, Scholastic National A Class, Scholastic Regional A, AA, and AAA. Novice Class and Cadet Class.

Guard teams can be chosen to move to a higher class, but they can only move down a class after a period of inactivity or after a WGI review. For every competition, any team which achieves a score higher than a predetermined threshold is automatically moved up, or "bumped", to the class above its current position, even mid-season.

The '''Scholastic division''' is made up of guards that have members that all attend the same high school or a feeder school of that high school. There are many colleges and universities that sponsor their own winter guards as well, but these guards typically compete as Independent guards. Scholastic guards vary greatly in their ability and resources because they are more dependent on support from sources other than the members themselves, such as their school's band and school funding.

In the Scholastic division, there are three classes: '''Scholastic A''', '''Scholastic Open''', and '''Scholastic World'''. More divisions may exist at the local/regional level, such as Regional A, or Novice. In many places there is also a middle school class, often called '''Cadet'''. Scholastic A teams tend to be a step above the regional level and are the lowest level to compete in WGI. Scholastic Open teams are an intermediate level for competition. The Scholastic World division includes the highest caliber of winter guard teams.

The '''Independent division''' is composed of winter guard teams that do not associate themselves with a school (the exception being university teams). Additionally, these kinds of guards can be much more selective of their members, choosing to be gender-specific or to only have certain numbers of members.

In the Independent division, much like the Scholastic division, there are the three classes: '''Independent A''', '''Independent Open''' and '''Independent World'''.  The breakdown of skill level and placement mirrors that of the Scholastic division. There are age restrictions in the Independent A and Open classes. A member can perform with an Independent A class group if they are 22 or younger as of March 31 of that year. A member can perform with an Independent Open class group if they are 23 or younger as of March 31 of that year.

==Winter guard circuits==

Although the goal of many winter guards is to compete in the WGI World Championships, most guard competitions take place in regional winter guard circuits. One such circuit is the AIA circuit, or Atlantic Indoor Association circuit in which teams across Virginia, Washington D.C., and North Carolina participate. These circuits are loosely organized and may not be formally affiliated with WGI. In many cases the circuits predate WGI by a number of years. For example, the Midwest Color Guard Circuit celebrated their 50th anniversary season in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwestcolorguard.com/ MidWest Color Guard Circuit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They may also have different competitive structures with additional classes to those in WGI. Circuit classes often will include beginner or novice guards such as '''Cadet''', '''Novice''', '''B''', '''Regional AAA''',  '''Regional AA''', '''Regional A''', and '''Regional Open'''. Circuits generally score using WGI standards and judges whether they are formally affiliated with WGI or not.

In addition, the winter guard activity is growing outside of the United States. In Europe, Color Guard Nederland (Netherlands) (CGN) and Winter Guard United Kingdom (WGUK) have recently affiliated with organizations from France and Germany to form the [[European Indoor Arts Alliance]] (EIAA) with the goal of creating a European Union-wide platform for the growth of the color guard activity in Europe, where the scholastic branch of the activity does not exist.
