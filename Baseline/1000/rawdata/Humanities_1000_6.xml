'''Antithesis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "setting opposite", from {{lang|grc|ἀντί}} "against" and {{lang|grc|θέσις}} "placing") is used in writing or speech either as a proposition that contrasts with or reverses some previously mentioned proposition, or when two opposites are introduced together for contrasting effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QCzeDfeUe30C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=Antithesis+figure+of+speech#v=onepage&amp;q=Antithesis%20figure%20of%20speech&amp;f=false | title = English Kumarbharati Grammar,Language Study &amp; Writing Skills Std.X | author1 = Ferreira | first1 = Gladwyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9xF14SzHIBAC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=Antithesis+figure+of+speech#v=onepage&amp;q=Antithesis%20figure%20of%20speech&amp;f=false | title = The Art of Writing and Speaking the English Language | isbn = 1406846570 | author1 = Cody | first1 = Sherwin | date = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antithesis can be defined as "a figure of speech involving a seeming contradiction of ideas, words, clauses, or sentences within a balanced grammatical structure. Parallelism of expression serves to emphasize opposition of ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Antithesis|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An antithesis must always contain two ideas within one statement. The ideas may not be structurally opposite, but they serve to be functionally opposite when comparing two ideas for emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd|first1=Alfred|title=The Logic of Antithesis|journal=The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods|date=25 May 1911|volume=8|issue=11|pages=281–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Aristotle]], the use of an antithesis makes the audience better understand the point the speaker is trying to make. Further explained, the comparison of two situations or ideas makes choosing the correct one simpler. Aristotle states that antithesis in rhetoric is similar to [[syllogism]] due to the presentation of two conclusions within a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Preminger|first1=Alex|last2=Brogan|first2=T.V.F.|title=Antithesis|date=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antitheses are used to strengthen an argument by using either exact opposites or simply contrasting ideas, but can also include both. They typically make a sentence more memorable for the reader or listener through balance and [[wikt:emphasis|emphasis]] of the words.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Skellon, "Antithesis: examples and definition," Speak Like A Pro. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhetorical antithesis ==
In [[rhetoric]], antithesis is a [[figure of speech]] involving the bringing out of a contrast in the [[idea]]s by an obvious contrast in the [[word]]s, [[clause]]s, or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], within a parallel grammatical structure.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antithesis|volume=2|pages=146-147}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "antithesis" in rhetoric goes back to the 4th century BC, for example Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', 1410a, in which he gives a series of examples.

An antithesis can be a simple statement contrasting two things, using a parallel structure:

*I defended the Republic as a '''young man'''; I shall not desert her now that I am '''old'''. ([[Cicero]], ''2nd Philippic'', 2.118)

Often there is a double antithesis, as in the following proverb, where "man" is opposed to "God", and "proposes" is contrasted with "disposes":

*'''Man proposes''', '''God disposes'''. (anonymous)

Another type is of the form "not A, but B" (negative-positive), in which the point made is emphasised by first being contrasted with its negative:

*I came not to bring '''peace''' but a '''sword'''. (St Matthew's Gospel, 10:34).

Another type involves a [[chiasmus]] (AB, BA word order), in which the contrasted words switch places:

*In '''peace''' you are for '''war''', and in '''war''' you long for '''peace'''.
*Two things show feebleness of mind: '''holding your breath''' at the time for '''speaking''', and '''speaking''' when you should be '''silent'''. ([[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]])

The negative-positive antithesis and the chiasmus-antithesis can be combined, as in the following sentence:
*Ask not what '''your country''' can do for '''you''' – ask what '''you''' can do for '''your country'''. – [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy]], 1961.

=== Some literary examples ===
Some other examples of antithesis are:

* Give '''every''' man '''thy ear''', but '''few''' thy '''voice'''. ([[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Hamlet]]'')
* '''Many''' are '''called''', but '''few''' are '''chosen.''' ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A14&amp;version=KJV Matthew 22:14])
* Never give in — never, never, never, never, in nothing '''great''' or '''small''', '''large''' or '''petty''', never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. (by [[Winston Churchill]])
* It was the '''best''' of times, it was the '''worst''' of times, it was the age of '''wisdom''', it was the age of '''foolishness''', it was the epoch of '''belief''', it was the epoch of '''incredulity''', it was the season of '''Light''', it was the season of '''Darkness''', it was the spring of '''hope''', it was the winter of '''despair''', we had '''everything''' before us, we had '''nothing''' before us, we were all going direct to '''Heaven''', we were all going direct the '''other way'''... ([[Charles Dickens]], ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'')
* We must learn to '''live together''' as '''brothers''' or '''perish together''' as '''fools'''. ([[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], speech at [[St. Louis]], 1964.)
* The world will little note, nor long remember '''what we say here''', but it can never forget '''what they did here'''. ([[Abraham Lincoln]], [[The Gettysburg Address]], 1863.)
* He who desires '''peace''', should prepare for '''war'''. ([[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]], ''Epitoma Rei Militaris'', book 3, introduction.)
* For '''now''' we see through a glass, darkly; but '''then''' face to face: '''now''' I know in part; but '''then''' shall I know even as also I am known. (St Paul, 1st Epistle to the Corinthians 13:12, King James version)
* My '''men''' have become '''women''', and my '''women''', '''men'''. (King [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] at the [[Battle of Salamis]] (480 BC), according to [[Herodotus]] 8.88.3)
* Senator, in everything I said about Iraq '''I''' turned out to be '''right''' and '''you''' turned out to be '''wrong'''. ([[George Galloway]] at a US Senate hearing, May 2005.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4557279.stm BBC News online, 17 May 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;
* I'm not saying that '''this or that statue''' was stolen from there; I'm saying this, that you, Verres, left '''not one single statue''' in Aspendus. ([[Cicero]], ''In Verrem'', 2.1.53.)
* I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the '''color of their skin''' but by the '''content of their character'''. ([[Martin Luther King]], 1963.)

== The "Antitheses" in St Matthew's Gospel ==
{{main|Matthew 5#Antitheses}}

''Matthew's Antitheses'' is the traditional name given to a section of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]{{bibleref2c|Matt.|5:17–48}} where [[Jesus]] takes six well known prescriptions of the [[613 Mitzvot|Mosaic Law]] and calls his followers to do more than the Law requires. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] scholars since the Reformation have generally believed that Jesus was setting his teaching over against false interpretations of the Law current at the time. "Antithesis" was the name given by [[Marcion of Sinope]] to a manifesto in which he contrasted the [[Old Testament]] with the [[New Testament]] and defined what came to be known as [[Marcionism]].

== In philosophical discussion ==
{{See also|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|Dialectic}}
In [[dialectic]]s (any formal system of reasoning that arrives at the truth by the exchange of logical arguments) antithesis is the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, usually in a balanced way. The logical arguments are said to be stated in the order [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]].

Although this style of philosophical discussion (stating a point of view, then its opposite, and finally drawing a conclusion) was commonly used by ancient philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Cicero, ''de Officiis'' 3.54-57.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the trio "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" itself to describe it goes back only to the 18th century, to a work published in 1794 by the German philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Robert R. (1992). ''Recognition: Fichte and Hegel on the Other''. SUNY Press. p. 46, note 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is sometimes incorrectly stated to originate from the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. However, Hegel never actually used the trio of terms except once in a lecture, in which he reproached [[Immanuel Kant]] for having "everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann,
 Walter, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', 1966, Anchor Books, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aporia''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἀπορία|ᾰ̓πορῐ́ᾱ]]|aporíā|impasse, difficulty in passage, lack of resources, puzzlement}}) denotes in [[philosophy]] a philosophical puzzle or state of puzzlement and in [[rhetoric]] a rhetorically useful expression of doubt.

==Definitions==
Definitions of the term ''aporia'' have varied throughout history. ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' includes two forms of the word: the adjective "aporetic", which it defines as "to be at a loss", "impassable", and "inclined to doubt, or to raise objections"; and the noun form "aporia", which it defines as the "state of the aporetic" and "a perplexity or difficulty". The dictionary entry also includes two early textual uses, which both refer to the term's rhetorical (rather than philosophical) usage.

In [[George Puttenham]]'s ''The Arte of English Poesie'' (1589), aporia is "the Doubtful, [so] called...because often we will seem to caste perils, and make doubts of things when by a plaine manner of speech we might affirm or deny [them]". In a reference from 1657, J. Smith's ''Mystical Rhetoric,'' the term becomes "a figure whereby the speaker sheweth that he doubteth, either where to begin for the multitude of matters, or what to do or say in some strange or ambiguous thing" (OED). [[Herbert Weir Smyth]]'s ''Greek Grammar'' (1956) also focuses on the rhetorical usage by defining aporia as "an artifice by which a speaker feigns doubts as to where he shall begin or end or what he shall do or say" (674).

More modern sources, perhaps because they come after the advent of [[post-structuralism]], have chosen to omit the rhetorical usage of the term. In [[William Harmon]]'s ''A Handbook to Literature,'' for example, aporia is identified as "a difficulty, impasse, or point of doubt and indecision", while also noting that critics such as [[Jacques Derrida]] have employed the term to "indicate a point of undecidability, which locates the site at which the text most obviously undermines its own rhetorical structure, dismantles, or deconstructs itself" (39). Julian Wolfreys, in his essay "Trauma, Testimony, and Criticism", characterizes trauma as aporia, a wound with unending trail. Valiur Rahaman, in his book  ''Interpretations: Essays in Literary Theory '' (2011), explained aporia as a creative force in both the artist and their art; it is, for the artist, an edgeless edge of the text or a work of art.

==Etymology==
The separation of aporia into its two morphemes ''a''- and ''poros'' ('without' and 'passage') reveals the word's rich [[etymological]] background as well as its connection to Platonic [[mythology]]. [[Sarah Kofman]] asserts that these two components are crucial to a fuller understanding of the word, which has been historically translated and understood somewhat reductively: "translators, who usually escape their perplexity by translating ''poros'' as 'expediency' and ''aporia'' as 'difficulty'...leave the reader in the dark as to all the semantic richness of ''poros'' and ''aporia'' and give no hint as to their links with other words belonging to the same 'family{{'"}} (9). Such links inevitably demonstrate that the terms are part of a "tradition" that [[Plato]] borrows from, a tradition which "breaks with a philosophical conception of translation, and with the logic of identity that it implies" (10). To demonstrate such a break, Kofman reviews multiple instances of the term throughout Plato's work. Her discussion of the myth of [[Porus (mythology)|Poros]], [[Penia]], and [[Eros]] in Plato's [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']] especially reveals the concept's untranslatability. Penia, the "child of poverty", decides to forcefully impregnate herself with the inebriated Poros, the personification of plenty, who is always in opposition with aporia and thus defining aporia. The result of this union is Eros, who inherits the disparate characteristics of his parents (25). The perplexing aspect of the myth is revealed as one realizes that Penia is acting out of resourcefulness, a quality normally attributed to Poros, and Poros' inaction reveals his own passivity, a poverty of agency or porous. Such a relationship intensely affects not only the context of aporia but its meaning as well: 

{{quote|Penia is no more the opposite of Poros than is the aporia; the true, philosophical aporia, or Penia, is always fertile; in her all opposites are placed under erasure; she is neither masculine nor feminine, neither rich nor poor…neither resourceful nor without resources. This is why Aporia, which breaks with the logic of identity, and which pertains to the logic of the intermediary, is an untranslatable term. (27) }}

Ultimately, aporia cannot be separated from this etymological and cultural history. Such history provides insight into aporia's perplexing semantic qualities as well as into the [[historical context]] in which the word functions as an indicator of the limits of language in constructing knowledge.

==Philosophy==&lt;!--This section is linked from 'Deconstruction'--&gt;
In philosophy, an aporia is a philosophical puzzle or a seemingly insoluble impasse in an inquiry, often arising as a result of equally plausible yet inconsistent premises (i.e. a [[paradox]]). It can also denote the state of being perplexed, or at a loss, at such a puzzle or impasse. The notion of an aporia is principally found in [[Greek philosophy]], but it also plays a role in post-structuralist philosophy, as in the writings of Jacques Derrida and [[Luce Irigaray]], and it has also served as an instrument of investigation in [[analytic philosophy]].

Plato's early dialogues are often called his 'aporetic' (Greek: ἀπορητικός) dialogues because they typically end in aporia. In such a dialogue, [[Socrates]] questions his [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] about the nature or definition of a concept, for example virtue or courage. Socrates then, through [[Method of Elenchus|elenctic]] testing, shows his interlocutor that his answer is unsatisfactory. After a number of such failed attempts, the interlocutor admits he is in aporia about the examined concept, concluding that he does not know what it is. In Plato's ''[[Meno]]'' (84a-c), Socrates describes the purgative effect of reducing someone to aporia: it shows someone who merely thought he knew something that he does not in fact know it and instills in him a desire to investigate it.

In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', aporia plays a role in his method of inquiry. In contrast to a [[rationalist]] inquiry that begins from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles, or an [[empiricist]] inquiry that begins from a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', he begins the ''Metaphysics'' by surveying the various ''aporiai'' that exist, drawing in particular on what puzzled his predecessors: "with a view to the science we are seeking [i.e., [[metaphysics]]], it is necessary that we should first review the things about which we need, from the outset, to be puzzled" (995a24). Book Beta of the ''Metaphysics'' is a list of the ''aporiai'' that preoccupy the rest of the work.

In [[Pyrrhonism]] aporia is intentionally induced as a means of producing [[ataraxia]].

Contemporary academic studies of the term further characterize its usage in philosophical discourses. In "Aporetics: Rational Deliberation in the Face of Inconsistency" (2009), [[Nicholas Rescher]] is concerned with the methods in which an aporia, or "apory", is intellectually processed and resolved. In the Preface, Rescher identifies the work as an attempt to "synthesize and systematize an aporetic procedure for dealing with information overload (of 'cognitive dissonance', as it is sometimes called)" (ix). The text is also useful in that it provides a more precise (although specialized) definition of the concept: "any cognitive situation in which the threat of inconsistency confronts us" (1). Rescher further introduces his specific study of the apory by qualifying the term as "a group of individually plausible but collectively incompatible theses", a designation he illustrates with the following syllogism or "cluster of contentions":

{{quote|1. What the sight of our eyes tells us is to be believed. 
2. Sight tells us the stick is bent. 

3. What the touch of our hand tells us is to be believed. 

4. Touch tells us the stick is straight. (2) }}

The aporia, or "apory" of this syllogism lies in the fact that, while each of these assertions is individually conceivable, together they are inconsistent or impossible (i.e. they constitute a [[paradox]]). Rescher's study is indicative of the continuing presence of scholarly examinations of the concept of aporia and, furthermore, of the continuing attempts of scholars to translate the word, to describe its modern meaning.

==Rhetoric==
Aporia is also a [[rhetorical device]] whereby the speaker expresses a [[doubt]]&amp;mdash;often feigned&amp;mdash;about his position or [[rhetorical question|asks the audience rhetorically]] how he or she should proceed. One aim of aporia may be to [[discredit]] the speaker's opponent. Aporia is also called ''dubitatio''. For example:

{{quote|I am at no loss for information about you and your family; but I am at a loss where to begin. Shall I relate how your father Tromes was a slave in the house of Elpias, who kept an elementary school near the Temple of Theseus, and how he wore shackles on his legs and a timber collar round his neck? Or how your mother practised daylight nuptials in an outhouse next door to Heros the bone-setter, and so brought you up to act in [[tableaux vivants]] and to excel in minor parts on the stage?|[[Demosthenes]] ''[[On the Crown|On The Crown]]'', 129}}

[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|right|thumb|An archivist surveying an unprocessed collection of materials. Surveying is commonly done to determine priorities for preservation and/or conservation of materials before an archivist begins arrangement and description.]]
An '''archivist''' (''AR-kiv-ist'') is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to [[Document|record]]s and [[archive]]s determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by an archivist can consist of a variety of forms, including letters, diaries, logs, other personal documents, government documents, sound and/or picture recordings, digital files, or other physical objects.

==Description==
As [[Richard Pearce-Moses]] wrote:

:"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce-Moses, Richard. "Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist?" ''Archival Outlook'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining what records have enduring value can be challenging. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives: A How-to-do-it Manual|last=Hunter|first=Gregory|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.|others=|year=2003|isbn=|editor=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory and scholarly work underpinning [[archive]]s practices is called [[archival science]].

The most common related occupations are [[librarian]]s, [[Curator|museum curators]], and [[records manager]]s. The archivist occupation is distinct from that of librarian. The two occupations have separate courses of training, adhere to separate and distinct principles, and are represented by separate [[Professional association|professional organization]]s. In general, the librarian tends to deal with published media (where the [[metadata]], such as author, title, and date of publication, may be readily apparent and can be presented in standardized form), whereas the archivist deals with unpublished media (which has different challenges such as the metadata not always being immediately apparent, containing complications and variety, and more likely to depend on [[provenance]]).

In addition, because archival records are frequently unique, some archivists may be as much concerned with the preservation and custody of the information carrier (i.e. the physical document) as with its informational content. In this regard, some would argue the archivist may have more in common with the [[Curator|museum curator]] than with the librarian.

The occupation of archivist is also frequently distinguished from that of [[records manager]], although in this case the distinction is less absolute: the archivist is predominantly concerned with records deemed worthy of permanent preservation, whereas the records manager is more concerned with records of current administrative importance.

==Duties and work environment==
Archivists' duties include acquiring and [[archival appraisal|appraising]] new collections, [[manuscript processing|arranging and describing records]], providing reference service, and preserving materials.  In arranging records, archivists apply two important principles: [[provenance]] and [[original order]].  Provenance refers to the creation of records and keeping different records separate in order to maintain context. Many entities create records, including governments, businesses, universities, and individuals. Original order is applied by keeping records in their order as established and maintained by the creator(s). Both provenance and original order are closely related to the concept of ''[[respect des fonds]]'', which states that records from one corporate body should not be mixed with records from another.

There are two aspects to arrangement: intellectual and physical. Both aspects follow the principle of original order. Archivists process the records physically by placing them in acid-free folders and boxes to ensure their long-term survival. They also process the records intellectually, by determining what the records consist of, how they are organized, and what, if any, [[finding aid]]s need to be created. Finding aids can be box lists or descriptive inventories, or indexes. Even if the original arrangement is unclear or unhelpful in terms of accessing the collection, it is rarely rearranged to something that makes more sense. This is because preserving the original order shows how the creator of the records functioned, why the records were created, and how they went about arranging them. Moreover, the provenance and authenticity of the records may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roe|first=Kathleen D.|title=Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts|year=2005|publisher=Society of American Archivists|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, original order is not always the best way to maintain some collections and archivists must use their own experience and current best practices to determine the correct way to preserve collections of mixed media or those lacking a clear original arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://saa.archivists.org/store/understanding-archives-and-manuscripts-afs-ii/339/|title=Understanding Archives and Manuscripts|last=O'Toole|first=James M. and Richard J. Cox|publisher=Society of American Archivists|others=|year=2006|isbn=|editor=|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists' work encompasses a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] decisions that may be thought of as falling into three broad and intertwined areas: legal requirements; professional standards; and accountability to society in selecting and preserving documentary materials that serve as a [[Primary sources|primary source]] of knowledge, and influence [[collective memory]] and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, Elena S. (2010). ''The Ethical Archivist''. Chicago: The Society of American Archivists. p. 22-26, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In negotiating the ethical conflicts that arise in their work, archivists are guided by [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielson (2010), chapter 1, "Codes of Ethics," p. 21-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of American Archivists first adopted a [https://www2.archivists.org/groups/committee-on-ethics-and-professional-conduct/code-of-ethics-history code of ethics] in 1980;&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;Horn, David E (1989). "[http://americanarchivist.org/doi/abs/10.17723/aarc.52.1.nk661527341j0610 The Development of Ethics in Archival Practice]." ''The American Archivist'', 2(1), p. 64-71. It was based on an earlier statement produced in training programs at the National Archives, under Archivist of the United States [[Wayne C. Grover]], and published as "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015071393535;view=image;page=root;size=100;seq=713;num=307 The Archivist's Code]" (''American Archivist'', vol. 18, no. 4, p. 307-308).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Council on Archives]] adopted one in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 ICA Code of Ethics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929074919/http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 |date=29 September 2015 }}." International Council on Archives. Retrieved 2015-09-01. The ICA code is available in 23 languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside their work in arranging and caring for collections, archivists assist users in interpreting materials and answering inquiries. This reference work can be a small part of an archivist's job in a smaller organization, or consist of most of their occupation in a larger archive where specific roles (such as [[Manuscript processing|processing archivist]] and [[Reference interview|reference archivist]]) may be delineated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Frances|date=|year=2000|title=Reference Service in an Academic Archives|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/science/article/pii/S0099133399001470|journal=The [[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=110–118|doi=10.1016/S0099-1333(99)00147-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists work for a variety of organizations, including [[government agency|government agencies]], [[local authorities]], museums, hospitals, historical societies, businesses, charities, corporations, [[colleges]] and universities, and any institution whose records may potentially be valuable to researchers, exhibitors, [[genealogist]]s, or others. They can also work on the collections of a large family or even of an [[individual]].

Archivists are often educators as well; it is not unusual for an archivist employed at a university or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or [[outreach]] programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]], [[Advertising campaign|promotional]] events, or even media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/guidelines/cu_guidelines4.asp|title=Guidelines for College and University Archives, Section IV. Core Archival Functions, Subsection D. Service |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[Encoded Archival Description]], along with increasing demand for materials to be made available online, has required archivists to become more tech-savvy in the past decade.  Many archivists are now acquiring basic [[XML]] skills in order to make their finding aids available to researchers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml|title=Encoded Archival Description |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Archives Hub| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125702/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml| archivedate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Between_the_Forks_Exhibit.JPG|right|thumb|An Archivist and volunteer worker with an exhibit on local history.  Project management, preservation of historic materials, and research skills are just a few of the abilities required in an archivist's background to make such public education efforts effective and exciting. {{speedy-image-c|22 April 2007}}]] --&gt;

Because of the varied nature of the job within different organizations and work environments, archivists need to have a wide range of [[skills]]:
* Those who work in reference and access-oriented positions should have good customer services skills, to help patrons with their research.
* A basic knowledge of [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|conservation]] is needed to help extend the life of cultural artifacts. Many types of media (such as photographs, acidic papers, and unstable copy processes) can deteriorate if not stored and maintained properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Mary Lynn | last=Ritzenthaler | year=1993 | title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=Society of American Archivists | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although many archival collections consist solely of paper records, increasingly archivists must confront the new challenges posed by the [[digital preservation|preservation]] of electronic records, so they need to be forward-looking and technologically proficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|accessdate=3 April 2007 |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational preparation==
The educational preparation for archivists varies from country to country.

===Australia===
The [[Australian Society of Archivists]] is the professional body for archivists, and is responsible for the accreditation of the various University courses.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/accredited-courses|title=Accredited courses|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first University to offer archival training was the [[University of New South Wales]], starting in 1973. The course closed in 2000.

Courses are now offered at [[Curtin University]] in [[Western Australia]], [[Charles Sturt University]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Monash University]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[University of South Australia]] at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The course at [[Edith Cowan University]] is being phased out.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Courses are offered in a variety of modes, including online via [[Open University Australia]] and through a combination of online and internal units at the various universities.

===Brazil===
The profession has been regulated since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/1970-1979/L6546.htm|title=L6546|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities in Brazil, such as the University of Brasilian (UnB), the [[Federal University of Santa Catarina]] (UFSC), the [[Federal University of Santa Maria]] (UFSM) and the [[São Paulo State University]] (UNESP) offer the degree in [[archival science]].

===Colombia===
In [[Colombia]], the [[Universidad de La Salle]] offers the degree of Professional in Information Systems, Library and Archival Sciences. It is a vocational training program, within existing legal standards aimed at providing knowledge, skills and abilities required for the design and management of information systems and documentation of various sorts. Its projection for the future is based on the application of new information technologies and communications for the management of information services economically viable. The program was created in 1971.

Other institutions that offers a degree in Archival Science are:
* [[Universidad del Quindío]] – Professional degree: Professional in Information and Documentation, Library and Archival Sciences.
* [[Universidad de Antioquia, Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Archival Science.
* [[Universidad Católica de Manizales]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.
* [[Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje]] – SENA – in chain training with the [[Antioquia Institute of Technology|Tecnológico de Antioquia]] Tecnológico de Antioquia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042453/http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Technical degree: Professional Technical in Archives, Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.

===France===
In France, the oldest Archivist School is the ''[[École des chartes]]'', founded in 1821. This prestigious ''[[grande école]]'' (literally, "grand schools) offers a diploma in "Archivist-Paleography" after a three-year curriculum. A part of its alumni pursue a State archivist career after an 18-month formation at the ''[[Institut national du patrimoine]]''. Most positions are reserved for European citizens.

Some universities offer master's degree in Archival Science: [[University of Angers|Angers]], [[University of Caen|Caen]], [[University of Dijon|Dijon]], [[Charles de Gaulle University - Lille III|Lille III]], [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3|Lyon III]], [[Upper Alsace University|Mulhouse]], [[Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University|Versailles Saint-Quentin]],

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the [[University College Dublin School of History and Archives]] offers a Masters of Arts degree in Archives and Records Management, recognised by the Society of Archivists.

===New Zealand===
[[Victoria University of Wellington]] is the only tertiary institution in [[New Zealand]] provides postgraduate archival courses. Victoria Information Studies qualifications with ARCR endorsement have been recognized by [[Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia]]. Open Polytechnic of New Zealand provides undergraduate archival courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there are currently five full- or part-time postgraduate courses in archives administration or management which are recognised by the [[Archives and Records Association]] (United Kingdom and Ireland). Students are expected to have relevant paid or voluntary [[work experience]] before obtaining a place on the UK courses; many undertake a year's traineeship. Also, professional certification (after qualifying) can be pursued via the Registration Scheme offered by the Archives and Records Association.

===United States===
The most common types of advanced degrees held by archivists are in [[archival science]], [[public history]], history, [[library science]], or [[library and information science]]. It is also possible for archivists to earn a doctorate in library and information science. Archivists with a PhD often work as teaching faculty, deans, or directors of archival programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakel and Bastian |first=Elizabeth and Jeannette |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Archival Graduate Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=349–366 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/YakelBastian-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Society of American Archivists]] published Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp#_ftn1 |title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies |accessdate=30 March 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406075051/http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also promotes and disseminates a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SAA Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics |accessdate=2015-09-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|url=http://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has undergone several revisions since it was first adopted in 1980.&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

The [[Academy of Certified Archivists]] offers supplemental archival training by means of a certification program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Certified Archivists|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110317200502/http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/| archivedate= 17 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When first established in 1989, some critics of ACA certification objected to its annual membership fees, the theoretical versus practical nature of its tests, and the need for members to re-certify every five years. However, in the decades since, it has been agreed that such requirements are comparable with certification programs in other professions, and that certification strengthens professional standards and individual competencies. While some positions in archives require certification and many employers view certification as preferred, it is not required by all employers in the United States. Approximately 1,200+ archivists were certified by ACA, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/about-us/presidents-address-2/|title=2016 President’s Address {{!}} Welcome to the Academy of Certified Archivists|last=Jones|first=Louis|date=|website=www.certifiedarchivists.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations and continuing education==
Many archivists belong to a professional organization, such as the [[Society of American Archivists]], the [[Association of Canadian Archivists]], the [[Archives and Records Association]] (UK/Ireland), the [[Colombian College of Archivists - CCA]], and the [[Australian Society of Archivists]], as well as any number of local or regional associations.  These organizations often provide ongoing educational opportunities to their members and other interested practitioners.   In addition to formal degrees and or apprenticeships, many archivists take part in continuing education opportunities as available through professional associations and library school programs. New discoveries in the fields of [[media preservation]] and emerging technologies require continuing education as part of an archivist's job in order to stay current in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmelman |first=Nancy |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Continuing Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=367–395 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Zimmelman-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the profession==
The first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen's manuals of 1571.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest predecessors of archival science - Jacob von Rammingen's two manuals of registry and archival management, printed in 1571, translated by JBLD Strömberg. Lund: Wallin &amp; Dalholm, Lundaboken, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and Baldassare Bonifacio's ''De Archivis libris singularis'' of 1632.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sandri, 'Il "De Archivis" di Baldassare Bonifacio', ''Notizie delle Archive di Stato'', Roma, 1950, p. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled ''Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques'' (''Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives''), in which he systematized the archival theory of the ''[[respect des fonds]]'', first published by [[Natalis de Wailly]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;F. Hildesheimer, "Les Premières publications des Archives", ''Histoires de France, historiens de la France'', Paris, 1994, p. 280-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin, published the ''Handleiding voor het ordenen en beschrijven van archieven'' (''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives''). Produced for the Dutch Association of Archivists, it set out one hundred rules for archivists to base their work around. Notably, within these rules, the principle of preserving [[provenance]] and original order was first argued for as an essential trait of archival arrangement and description.&lt;ref name=Cook1997&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major text was the ''Manual of Archive Administration'' published in 1922 by [[Hilary Jenkinson]], then employed at the British [[Public Record Office]]: a revised edition appeared in 1937. In this work, Jenkinson states that archives are evidence and that the moral and physical defence of this evidential value is the central tenet of archival work. He further outlines his ideas of what an archive should be and how it should operate.

In 1956, [[T. R. Schellenberg]], who is known as the "Father of American Archival Appraisal",&lt;ref name=Cook1997/&gt; published ''Modern Archives''. Schellenberg's work was intended to be an academic textbook defining archival methodology and giving archivists specific technical instruction on workflow and arrangement. Moving away from Jenkinson's organic and passive approach to archival acquisition, where the administrator decided what was kept and what was destroyed, Schellenberg argued for a more active approach by archivists to appraisal. His primary (administrative) and secondary (research) value model for the management and appraisal of records and archives allowed government archivists greater control over the influx of material that they faced after the Second World War. As a result of the widespread adoption of Schellenberg's methods, especially in the United States of America, modern [[Records Management]] as a separate but related discipline was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Theodore R. | last=Schellenberg | year=1956 | title=Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Ernst Posner]] published ''Archives in the Ancient World''.  Posner's work emphasized that archives were not new inventions, but had existed in many different societies throughout recorded history.

In 1975, essays by [[Margaret C. Norton|Margaret Cross Norton]] were collected under the title of ''Norton on Archives: The Writings of Margaret Cross Norton on Archival and Records Management''. Norton was one of the founders of the [[Society of American Archivists]], and wrote essays based on her decades of experience working in the [[Illinois]] State Archives.

==Archives 2.0==

Archivists, like librarians, are taking advantage of [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as blogs, [[wiki]]s, as well as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open source]] philosophies. While Archives 2.0 may refer to implementing new technologies, it is also a way of engaging with archives in an effort to promote openness and flexibility of archival materials. This can be achieved through community participation in archives, archivists actively engaging with their collections, and promoting archival benefits in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theimer|first=Kate|date=2011|title=What is the Meaning of Archives 2.0?|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.74.1.h7tn4m4027407666|journal=The American Archivist|volume=74|pages=58–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Theimer writes that in order to understand Archives 2.0, it must be compared against Archives 1.0. She asserts that her representation of Archives 1.0 is by no means exhaustive or fully comprehensive of the breadth of archival experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following is a list of contrasts between 1.0 and 2.0.

* "Open, not closed;
* Transparent, not opaque;
* User centered, not record centered;
* Facilitator, not gatekeeper;
* Attracting new users, not relying on users to find them;
* Shared standards, not localized practice;
* Metrics and measurement, not 'unmeasurable' results;
* Iterative products, not 'perfect' products;
* Innovation and flexibility, not adhering to tradition;
* Technology savvy, not technology phobic;
* Value doing, not knowing;
* Confident about lobbying for resources, not hesitant beggars."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The technological tools of Archives 2.0 provide the foundational platforms to help the change from 1.0 to 2.0. When working in an archives that is dedicated to upholding 2.0 standards, the focus has shifted onto the user experience at an archives:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; community use, or research and reference help.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889-90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php, accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the earlier ''[[comédie en vaudeville]]'' and the later ''[[Singspiel]]'', its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were '[[opera]]s' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported ''[[opera seria]]''.   Music critic [[Peter Gammond]] describes the ballad opera as "an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song."&lt;ref name="gammond"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Peter| last1= Gammond| year= 1991| title= The Oxford Companion to Popular Music| publisher= Oxford University Press| location= Oxford| pages=35–36 | isbn= 0-19-311323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest ballad operas==
Ballad opera has been called an "eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene."&lt;ref name=Lubbock&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.

It is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728.&lt;ref&gt;J. Milling, P. Thomson, J. W. Donohue, eds, ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre: 1660 to 1895'' / edited by Joseph Donohue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[Johann Christoph Pepusch]], both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in [[Paris]], and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form.  They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas D'Urfey]] (1653–1723) who had a reputation for [[parody music|fitting new words to existing songs]]; [[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy|a popular anthology of these settings]] was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "D'Urfey, Thomas".&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in ''The Beggar's Opera''.

After the success of ''The Beggar's Opera'', many similar pieces were staged.  The actor [[Thomas Walker (actor)|Thomas Walker]], who played [[Macheath]] in the original production, wrote several ballad operas,&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt; and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, ''Polly''.  [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], [[Charles Coffey]], [[Thomas Arne]], [[Charles Dibdin]], Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref name=Lubbock/&gt; By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WarwickWest1992&gt;J. Warwick and E. West, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in ''The Beggar's Opera'' the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir [[Robert Walpole]]. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to ''The Beggar's Opera'', ''Polly''.

The tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern "[[jukebox musical]]"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including [[folk music|folk melodies]], popular airs by classical composers (such as [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]) and even children's [[nursery rhymes]]. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London [[broadside (music)|broadside ballad]]s are set. It is from this connection that the term "ballad opera" is drawn. This ragbag of [[Parody music|"pre-loved" music]] is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms.  Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as "[[Lillibullero]]", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;  In 1762, Thomas Arne's ''[[Love in a Village]]'' presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's ''Lionel and Clarissa'' in 1768.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;

''[[The Disappointment]]'' (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.

==Singspiel connection==
In 1736 the [[Prussia]]n ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, ''The Devil to Pay'', by [[Charles Coffey]]. This was successfully performed in [[Hamburg]], [[Leipzig]] and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and [[Johann Adam Hiller]] in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]) "the fathers of the German Singspiel". (The storyline of ''The Devil to Pay'' was also adapted for [[Gluck]] for his 1759 French opera ''[[Le diable à quatre (opera)|Le diable à quatre]]'').

==Pastoral ballad opera ==
A later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more "pastoral" form. In subject matter, especially, these "ballad operas" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) ''The Beggar's Opera'', the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]]'s ''Love in a Village'', and [[William Shield]]'s ''Rosina'' (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.

Later in the century broader comedies such as [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Duenna'' and the innumerable works of [[Charles Dibdin]] moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.

==19th century==
English 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of "serious" practitioners such as [[John Barnett]]. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert's]] contribution to the [[Savoy opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbrook|first=H. M.|year=1922|title=Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/index.html|location=|accessdate=24 June 2009|publisher=F. V. White &amp; Co. Ltd|chapter=IV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043908/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/walbrook/index.html|archive-date=2008-05-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balfe's opera ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' (1843) is one of the few British Ballad operas of the 20th century to gain international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, Donald Jay, Hermine Weigel Williams [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xXZhKagLO4C&amp;pg=PA563 "National Traditions of Opera"], ''A Short History of Opera'', Columbia University Press (2013), p. 563 {{ISBN|0231507720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1928) is a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.

In a completely different vein, ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'', an [[opera]] in two acts by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a "ballad opera". It is plainly much closer to [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' than to ''The Beggar's Opera''.

In the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called "ballad operas". [[Alan Lomax]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Burl Ives]], and others recorded ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy]] and others recorded ''The Transports'' in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric ''Beggar's Opera'' type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.

Ironically, it is in the [[Musical theatre|musicals]] of [[Kander and Ebb]]—especially ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''—that the kind of satire embodied in ''The Beggar's Opera'' and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">In the year 616 an anonymous scholar extended [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]] to an Easter table covering the years 532 up to and including 721.   Dionysius' table was published in 525 and only a century later accepted by the church of Rome, which from the third century up till then had given preference to go on using her own, relatively inadequate, Easter tables.   From about the middle of the seventh century all controversy between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date of Easter ceased, as both churches were now using identical tables.   

In the year 725 [[Bede#Scientific writings|Bede]] (Latin name Beda Venerabilis) published a new extension of Dionysius’ Easter table to a great '''Easter cycle''', which is periodic in its entirety and in which consequently not only the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Paschal full moon]] but also the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Easter Sunday]] is periodic. Bede’s Easter cycle contains lunar cycles (of 19 years) as well as solar cycles (of 28 years), and therefore it has a period of 532 years. In the [[Byzantine empire]] thanks to the Paschal cycle of [[Annianus of Alexandria]] at all times the churches were acquainted with the correct date of the next Easter Sunday. It is Beda Venerabilis’ Easter cycle by means of which also the churches in the part of Europe outside the Byzantine empire got that possibility.

Best Enemies has also been used as a community-based education program that illustrates the issue of cyber bullying through a film based on a true story of a 15-year-old girl whose best friend betrayed her in a bullying campaign conducted via SMS and online messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yapa.org.au/yapa/events/shift/workshops.php Youth Action and Policy Association NSW] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010115624/http://www.yapa.org.au/yapa/events/shift/workshops.php |date=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program targets schools and youth organisations to address the causes and consequences of the serious social problem of cyber bullying and cyber safety. The program is supported by Youth Interagency Groups, the Department of Education and Training and various agencies of the NSW Government.

The Best Enemies study guide and cybersafety resource was produced by The [[Australian Teachers of Media]] and is also distributed by The Education Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeducationshop.com.au/shop/product.asp?pID=3314&amp;cID=19 The Education Shop - Best Enemies Study Guide and DVD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is supported by [[Hoyts]], [[Girlfriend Magazine]], Mentos Cube, [[Myspace]] and Point Zero Youth Services.

==Partnership with Bully Free Australia Foundation==
In March 2013, Best Enemies and The Bully Free Australia Foundation signed a partnership agreement with a vision to "protect and empower Australian children and adolescents to live a fulfilling life free from all forms of bullying".

On 16 March 2013, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard formally opened The Bully Free Australia Foundation at Essendon Airport to a crowd of more than 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/bill-to-stop-workplace-bullies-20130316-2g76e.html|title=Bill to stop workplace bullies |last=Schetzer|first=Alana |date=March 16, 2013|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''calligram''' is a text visually arranged in a way that it forms an image associated with the text's contents. It can be a [[Poetry|poem]], a phrase, a portion of [[scripture]], or a single word; the visual arrangement can rely on certain use of the [[typeface]], [[calligraphy]] or [[handwriting]], for instance along non-parallel and curved text lines, or in shaped paragraphs. The image created by the words illustrates the text by expressing visually what it says, or something closely associated; it can also, on purpose, show something contradictory with the text or otherwise misleading.

[[Guillaume Apollinaire]] was a famous calligram writer and author of a book of poems called ''[[Calligrammes]]''.

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension such a description or map.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson 1992, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".&lt;ref&gt;Rohl 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy as imagined by a 16th-century artist]]

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.&lt;/ref&gt; An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Camden]]
The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull Chorographers";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

[[File:Ferdinand von Richthofen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand von Richthofen]]

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
The {{Nihongo|'''''dangibon'''''|談義本|}} was a pre-modern Japanese literary genre. Texts were written in a humorous, satirical sermon-style with the purpose of educating the masses. It is type of [[gesaku]].

==Developments==
{{Nihongo|Masuho Zankō|増穂残口|}} and {{Nihongo|Issai Chozan|佚斎樗山|}} are credited with establishing the early foundations upon which the genre rests. In 1715, Masuho wrote {{Nihongo|''Endō Tukugan''|艶道通鑑|}}, and in 1727 Issai wrote {{Nihongo|''Inaka Sōji''|田舎荘子|}}. These two texts are early forerunners of the genre. However, the genre is not fully realized until several decades later. In 1752, {{Nihongo|Jōkanbō Kōa|静観房好阿|}} wrote {{Nihongo|''Imayō Heta Dangi''|当世下手談義||"A Clumsy Sermon in the Modern Manner"}}, which is identified as the first true example of the dangibon genre.

The genre existed between the 1752 c. 1800, reaching "the height of their popularity in the 1750s."&lt;ref&gt;Keene (1976: 412)&lt;/ref&gt; It gradually evolved into the [[kokkeibon]] genre at the start of the 19th century.

'''De-categorialization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''de-categorialisation''') in [[linguistics]], refers to one of the five principles by which [[grammaticalization]] can be detected while it is taking place (according to [[Paul Hopper]]). The other four are [[Layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[Divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialization]], and [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]].

De-categorialization can be described as the loss of [[morphosyntactic]] properties.

'''Deaccessioning''' is defined as the process by which a work of art or other object is permanently removed from a [[Collection (artwork)|museum’s collection]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Report from the AAMD Task Force on Deaccessioning. 2010. ''AAMD Policy on Deaccessioning''. The Association of American Museum Directors, June 9, 2010. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803191723/https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }} Accessed November 14th 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; Deaccessioning is a practical and constructive tool of collections care that, if practiced thoughtfully supports the long-term preservation of a collection and can help a [[museum]] refine the scope of its collection in order to better serve its mission and community.

==Deaccession policy==
The process undertaken by a museum to deaccession a work involves several steps that are usually laid out in a museum`s [[Collections policy|Collection Management Policy]]. The terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process are outlined in the "Deaccession" section of this document.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions and ethic considerations associated with removal of the object and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession.

==Decision process==
Each museum establishes its own method and workflow for the deaccession process according to its organizational structure. However all object deaccessioning involves the two processing steps of deaccession and disposal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last = Buck|first = Rebecca A.|last2 = Gilmore|first2 = Jean Allman|title = Museum Registration Methods|place = Washington, D.C.|publisher = The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year = 2010|edition = 5|chapter = 3I: Deaccessioning|pages = 100–107|isbn = 978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Park Service - Museum Management Program|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/handbook.html|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process begins with the [[curator]] creating a document called a "Statement of Justification," which outlines their decision criteria and reasoning for presenting the work as a possible deaccession. In order to determine if a work should be deaccessioned from a museum`s collection, a [[curator]] or [[Registrar (museum)|registrar]] completes and documents a series of justification steps and then present their findings to the museum director and governing board for final approval.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Deaccession criteria===
There are a number of reasons why deaccessioning might be considered. The following is a typical list of criteria for deaccession and disposal:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The work is no longer consistent with the mission or collecting goals of the museum. 
* The work is of poor quality and lacks value for exhibition or study purposes. 
* The physical condition of the work is so poor that restoration is not practicable or would compromise the work’s integrity or the artist’s intent. Works damaged beyond reasonable repair that are not of use for study or teaching purposes may be destroyed.  
* The museum is unable to care adequately for the work because of the work’s particular requirements for storage or display or its continuing need for special treatment for proper and long term conservation.  
* The work is being sold as part of the museum’s effort to refine and improve its collections, in keeping with the collecting goals reviewed and approved by the museum’s Board of Trustees or governing body.  
* The authenticity or attribution of the work is determined to be false or fraudulent and the object lacks sufficient aesthetic merit or art historical importance to warrant retention.  
* The work is a duplicate that has no value as part of a series.  
* The work may have been stolen or illegally imported in violation of applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the museum is located or the work may be subject to other legal claims, including but not limited to repatriation under [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA (]]The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) and art found to have been plundered during WWII by the [[Nazi plunder|Nazis]].

===Deaccession justification steps===
The typical steps that need to be taken in order to justify the deaccession and disposal of the work include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* Verification of Legal Status: Staff verifies that the museum possesses official legal title of the work and check their records in order to ascertain if there are any restrictions that exist in the original gift, bequest, or purchase which may hinder or limit disposal options, including transfer of copyright or trademark.
** The need to establish clear and unrestricted title is important because it ensures the museum can dispose of the work the via legal sale without risk of improper title transfer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Malaro, M. and I.P. DeAngelis (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections. Chp. 5: The Disposal of Objects. pp.248-272.  Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See:[[Tangible personal property]]
** Donor restrictions are also uncovered at this stage of the process. Some donor restrictions determined at the gifting or bequest of the work or works may hinder the deaccession and/or the disposal process. 
*** For example, the museum is looking to deaccession one piece of a set that was gifted and the donor`s "Deed of Gift or Bequest" included a request that the set remain together. In this case, the museum might need to seek legal counsel and take the documents to a judge to gain release from the Deed of Gift or Bequest restrictions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
** In the process of determining clear title, [[provenance]] research should ideally be conducted, especially if the deaccession process was instigated by a claim of illicit title, such as in the case of a Nazi Looted work or stolen work of antiquity. 
*** See [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO]] Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property and AAM Statement on the "Standards Regarding the Unlawful Appropriation of Objects During the Nazi Era"[http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/collections-stewardship/objects-during-the-nazi-era]
*Physical Examination: A conservator conducts an assessment of the work to determine its current  condition, future maintenance needs, and viable disposal options, such as possible sale or destruction. 
*Object Evaluation: Acquiring through one or more appraisers reasonable evaluations of the work would be helpful especially if the work is to be disposed of via sale, auction, transfer or exchange for value in kind with another institution.
*Director and/ or Governing Board approval: Following an internal review by all relevant staff, all documentation is presented to the Governing Board and/or the CEO/ Museum Director for final approval. The workflow and final decision on deaccession is subject to the collection policies workflow and charters for each museum.   
*Notification of Donor and/or External Stakeholders: Once the Governing Board and/ or the CEO/ Museum Director approves the deaccession the last step before beginning disposal is the notification of donor and external stakeholders of the deaccession. Although the museum holds clear title of the work and is not obliged by law to contact the donor of intent to deaccession, many museums contact donors or relatives out of courtesy. Museums may also confer with local community advisory groups, such as museum members, local collectors, other local museums, and volunteers about the deaccession to inform and gain community perspective on the work and its value to the collection.

===Disposal===
Disposal is defined as the transfer of ownership by the museum after a work has been deaccessioned. Following approval of deaccession from the Governing Board and/or the CEO/Museum Director, the work is disposed of and the title of ownership is completely transferred away from the museum or terminated. The method chosen is determined by the physical condition of the work, the intrinsic value or cultural value of the work and extrinsic value or monetary value of the work. With all methods of disposal, museums are charged to maintain and retain all records of the object, its deaccession and disposal.

The process of disposal is completed through the following methods:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

*Donation of the object to another museum, library, or archive for educational purposes 
**This is the ideal disposal choice for museums as it assures that the object will remain accessible to the public. Museums seek out possible institutions where the object might a useful addition to the collection or is better equipped to maintain the object.[[File:Antonio Molinari - Adamo ed Eva.jpg|thumb|Antonio Molinari - Adamo ed Eva, An example of a Deaccessioned work: Deaccessioned in 1988 from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Purchased by Ball State University Museum of Art, Muncie, Indiana from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1989.]]
*Exchange of the object for another object with another museum or non-profit institution
**This is another viable method for assuring that the object remains accessible to the public in some way.  Exchanges are made in such a way that there is relatively equal value of the items involved, not just monetarily but historically.
***Museum should be able to justify the trade, including any exceptional circumstances that would favor one party over another. This is why obtaining an appraisal of the object from more than one appraiser is a mandatory step in the deaccession process. See &lt;u&gt;Object Evaluation&lt;/u&gt; above.   
*Educational and Research programs 
**Often works deaccession from the collection can be reallocated into educational programs, to be used for hands-on demonstrations, school outreach programs, or testing for conservation research. In this case it is understood that the work will be subject to physical destruction over time.  In this case, the work would be re-accessioned into a study or educational collection that is not as closely monitored as that of the main collection. See link for one example of an outreach school program that utilizes deaccessioned works [http://www.historyisfun.org/learn/virginia-outreach/].   
*Physical Destruction 
**Objects that may have deteriorated due to an [[Inherent vice (library and archival science)|inherent vice]], natural disaster, vandalism, accident, or other causes as well as works that made be considered hazardous, such as those containing drugs, chemicals, explosives, or asbestos should be disposed of via physical destruction. If dealing with hazardous materials, the proper authorities should be consulted in order to determine the best method of destruction.  The method of destruction will depend on the type of material and completed in such a ways as to be irreversible. This is also the best method for works that are found to be fakes or [[Forgery|forgeries]]. See &lt;u&gt;Physical Examination&lt;/u&gt; above.   
**Human remains or certain items of religious or cultural sensitivity might need to be handled in a prescribed way in order to meet legal requirements or cultural standards. See [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]] from more information.    
*Repatriation. 
**Repatriation is the process of returning an object to their place of origin or proper owner.  This is method of disposal is used for objects found to be illicitly held by the museum, such as [[Nazi plunder|Nazi Looted Art]] and objects requested for return according to [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]]. The illicit status of an object would be determined upon claim of repatriation via NAGPRA or claim by proper owner, in the case of Nazi Looted or other stolen works. In either case, clear title and provenance would be determined during the Verification of Legal Status step of deaccession. See &lt;u&gt;Verification of Legal Status&lt;/u&gt; above.    
*Return to Donor.
**Similar to the process of repatriation, if the work was donated to the museum and the donor or legal heir can be located at time of deaccession processing, the museum may elect to return the object to the donor. This is not the best option for museums for a few reasons. First, it removes the work from public accessibility and second, it can cause tax complications, as a deduction can be given for a portion of the work`s value upon donation and the return of the work to the donor may result in an audit or at least IRS claim on the deduction value previously received.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Crosby Garrett Helmet on auction at Christies.jpg|thumb|An auction at [[Christie's]].]]
*Private Sale and Public Auction.
**Another method of disposal that is not the best option for museums. Museums hold collections in the public trust for public access. Though the best manner in which to generate funds from disposal for future accessions and care of current collection, disposal of works via sale or auction takes the work away from public access and places it into the hands of private citizens.

==Deaccession and museum ethics==
Several professional museum associations have drafted codes of ethics governing the practice of deaccession.nTwo majors areas of ethical concern that are common in these codes of ethics are the prohibition of sale or transfer of collection items to museum trustees, staff, board members, or their relatives and the need to restrict the use of proceeds from any works disposed of via sale or auction.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Stephen E. ''A Deaccession Reader.'' Washington, DC: American Association of Museums, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these ethical concerns is rather straightforward. The second has become a point of contention in recent years since museums and cities, like Detroit, have been struggling with financial shortfalls.

According to the [https://www.aamd.org/ AAMD] (The Association of Art Museum Directors): "Funds received from the disposal of a deaccessioned work shall not be used for operations or capital expenses. Such funds, including any earnings and appreciation thereon, may be used only for the acquisition of works in a manner consistent with the museum’s policy on the use of restricted acquisition funds."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the [http://www.aam-us.org/home AAM] (the American Association of Museums): "Proceeds from the sale of nonliving collections are to be used consistent with the established standards of the museum`s discipline, but in no event shall they be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections."&lt;ref&gt;''Code of Ethics for Museums'', AAM. Washington DC. 1994, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Association for State and Local History|AASLH]] (the American Association for State and Local History): "Collections shall not be deaccessioned or disposed of in order to provide financial support for institutional operations, facilities maintenance, or any reason other than the preservation or acquisition of collections."&lt;ref&gt;A Statement of Professional Ethics, American Association for State and Local History, Nashville, Tennessee, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [http://icom.museum/ ICOM] (the International Council of Museums): Proceeds should be applied solely to the purchase of additions to museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/ICOM_News/2003-1/ENG/p3_2003-1.pdf|title = Deaccessioning and ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums|date = Jan 2003|accessdate = |website = ICOM News|publisher = ICOM News|last = Lewis|first = Geoffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These associations have each determined to their own degree that all proceeds from sale or auction should be restricted to the future acquisition of collection objects and/ or to the ongoing maintenance of current collection holdings. Their decision and perspective on the practice of deaccession reflects a long-term view of museum collections as items held in public trust and preserved for access, appreciation, education, and enjoyment of not only today`s public but the future public. See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/public_trust_doctrine Public trust doctrine]

==Views on deaccessioning==
Deaccessioning is a controversial topic and activity, with diverging opinions from artists, arts professionals and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Museums Draw Scrutiny When They Sell Artworks|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/design/27sell.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-01-26|access-date = 2015-12-12|issn = 0362-4331|first = Robin|last = Pogrebin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, such as Donn Zaretsky of The Art Law Blog critique the notion of "the public trust" and argue that deaccessioning rules should probably be thrown out altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AAMD Rules Need to be Deaccessioned - News - Art in America|url = http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/aamd-rules-need-to-be-deaccessioned/|website = www.artinamericamagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Susan Taylor, director of the New Orleans Museum of Art and the AAMD's current president, believes that proceeds from the sale or funds from the deaccession can only be used to buy other works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = As Museums Try To Make Ends Meet, 'Deaccession' Is The Art World's Dirty Word|url = https://www.npr.org/2014/08/11/339532879/as-museums-try-to-make-ends-meet-deaccession-is-the-art-worlds-dirty-word|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Description''' is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Description is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a fiction-writing mode==
Fiction-writing also has modes: [[Action (fiction)|action]], exposition, description, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morrell |2006 |p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Selgin |2007 |p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of [[fiction-writing mode]]s and their uses.

Description is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. As stated in ''Writing from A to Z'', edited by Kirk Polking, description is more than the amassing of details; it is bringing something to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Polking |1990 |p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most appropriate and effective techniques for presenting description are a matter of ongoing discussion among writers and writing coaches.

==Purple prose==
{{Main|Purple prose}}
A purple patch is an over-written passage in which the writer has strained too hard to achieve an impressive effect, by elaborate figures or other means.  The phrase ([[Latin]]:  "purpureus pannus") was first used by the Roman poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (c. 20 [[Before Christ|BC]]) to denote an irrelevant and excessively ornate passage; the sense of irrelevance is normally absent in modern usage, although such passages are usually incongruous.  By extension, '''purple prose''' is lavishly figurative, rhythmic, or otherwise overwrought.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, the [[Theory of descriptions|nature of description]] has been an important question since [[Bertrand Russell]]'s classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Ludlow|first= Peter |year=2007|title= Descriptions|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology |concepts}}

'''Development anthropology''' refers to the [[Applied anthropology|application of anthropological]] perspectives to the [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] branch of [[development studies]]. It takes [[international development]] and international [[aid]] as primary objects. In this branch of [[anthropology]], the term ''development'' refers to the social action made by different agents (e.g. [[institution]]s, [[business]]es, [[State (polity)|states]], or independent [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s) who are trying to modify the [[Economy|economic]], technical, political, or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in [[Poverty|impoverished]], formerly colonized regions.

Development anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer [[Western culture|Western]] projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most [[Marginalization|marginalized]], and to eliminate poverty. While some theorists distinguish between the [[anthropology of development]] (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], 1995, ''Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World'', Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With researches on the field, the anthropologist can describe, analyze, and understand the different actions of development that took and take place in a given place. The various impacts on the local population, environment, society, and economy are to be examined.

==History==

In 1971, Glynn Cochrane proposed development anthropology as a new field for practitioners interested in a career outside academia.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''Development Anthropology'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, (ed.) ''What can we do for each other, An Interdisciplinary Approach to Development Anthropology'', (Amsterdam: Grüner, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Given the growing complexity of development assistance, Cochrane suggested that graduates needed to prepare themselves to work in interdisciplinary settings.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, "Policy Studies and Anthropology", in ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 21, No., 4, August, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Cochrane was invited by the [[World Bank]] to make recommendations for the use of anthropology, and his report&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''The Use of Anthropology in Project Operations of the World Bank Group'', (World Bank/IMF, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; (which stressed the need for the systematic treatment of social issues) laid a foundation for future use of the discipline in the [[World Bank Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goodlund, ''Social and Environmental Assessment to Promote Sustainability, an Informal View from the World Bank'', (Glasgow: International Association for Impact Assessment, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Around ninety anthropologists are now employed by the World Bank Group in various roles.

In 1974, Bob Berg—of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID)—and Cochrane worked together, and, as a result, USAID introduced "social soundness analysis" as a project preparation requirement. This innovation led to the employment of more than seventy anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hoben, "Anthropologists and Development", in ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', Vol. 11: 349-375 (Volume publication date October 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''The Cultural Appraisal of Development Projects'', (New York: Praeger, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Social soundness analysis has now been in USAID use for over forty years. USAID ran an in-house development studies course in the 1970s, through which several hundred field personnel eventually passed. In addition to anthropology, the course covered development [[economics]], regional and national planning, and institution building.

In the late 1970s, Thayer Scudder, Michael Horowitz,  and David Brokensha established an Institute for Development Anthropology at the [[State University of New York]] at Binghamton. This institute has played an influential role in the continuing expansion of this branch of the discipline.

By the 1980s and 1990s, development anthropology began to be more widely used in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''Festival Elephants and the Myth of Global Poverty'', (New York: Pearson, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate social responsibility and issues ranging from resettlement and [[human rights]] to [[micro-enterprise]] are now routinely addressed by systematic social assessment as an integral part of investment appraisal.

==Development criticism==
{{see also|Development criticism}}

Criticism of Western development became an important goal in the late 1980s, after the wake of severe economic crisis brought disease, poverty, and [[starvation]] to countries and sectors that were the focus of large Western [[structural adjustment]] development projects throughout [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and other parts of the former colonial world. Despite the failure of many of these development projects, and some 40 years of post [[World War II]] funding from the US and Europe, scholars know{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} that development has been the key way that Western post-industrialized countries intervene in non-Western society. Development criticism seeks to discover why, given the funds and best intentions of volunteers and policy makers, do the majority of development projects continue to fail to (1) redistribute economic power and resources in a way that helps the poorest sectors of society, and (2) to create economic growth that is sustainable in the country.

Anthropologists who study development projects themselves have criticized the fundamental structure of Western development projects coming from such institutions as USAID and bilateral lenders such as the World Bank. Because they are often working from the perspective of the objects of development in the non-Western world, rather than from within the aid institutions, anthropologists encountering such projects have a unique perspective from which to see the problems. Anthropologists write with concern about the ways that non-Western objects of aid have been left out of the widespread drive to develop after World War II, especially in the ways that such projects limit solutions to poverty in the form of narrow Western [[Capitalism|capitalist]] models that promote exploitation and the destruction of household farms, or, more suspiciously, naturalise inequality between Western post-industrialized countries and former colonial subjects.

Some describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits [[modernization]] and an eradication of the indigenous culture, but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work. In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers; however, they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based. Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid. The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself. Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that [[sustainable development]] requires at the very least more involvement of the people who the project aims to target in the project's creation, its management, and its decision-making processes.

A major critique of development from anthropologists came from [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]]'s seminal book ''[[Encountering Development]]'', which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples and enacted an [[Orientalism]] (see [[Edward Said]]). Escobar&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Escobar, 1995, ''Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; even sees international development as a means for the [[Western world|Occident]] to keep control over the resources of former colonies. Escobar shows that, between 1945 and 1960, the former colonies were going through the [[decolonization]] era, and the development plan helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old [[metropole]]. Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of World War II, and during the [[Cold War]], when they were developed to (1) stop the spread of [[communism]] with the spread of capitalist markets, and (2) create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad. Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like [[dependency theory]] or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations. Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of dependency theory and follows a larger critique more recently posed by [[Michel Foucault]] and other [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]].

More recent studies like [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]]'s ''[[The Anti-Politics Machine]]'' argue that the ideas and institutional structure that support Western development projects are fundamentally flawed because of the way the West continues to represent the former colonial world. International development uses an "anti-politics" that ultimately produces failure, despite the best intentions. Finally, studies also point out how development efforts often attempt to de-politicize change by a focus on instrumental assistance (like a school building) but not on the objective conditions that led to the development failure (e.g., the state's neglect of rural children at the expense of urban elite), nor the content of what the school might or might not teach. In this sense, the critique of international development focuses on the insidious effects of projects that at the least offer band-aids that address symptoms but not causes, and that at the worst promote projects that systematically redirect economic resources and profit to the West.

== Applied anthropology in development ==
While anthropological studies critique the Western assumptions and political context of development projects, anthropologists also consult on and work within aid institutions in the creation and implementation of development projects. While economists look at aggregate measures like [[gross national product]] and [[per capita income]], as well as measures of [[income distribution]] and [[economic inequality]] in a society, anthropologists can provide a more fine-grained analysis of the qualitative information behind these numbers, such as the nature of the social groups involved and the social significance of the composition of income. Thus, development anthropologists often deal with assessing the important qualitative aspects of development sometimes ignored by an economic approach.

'''Eavesdropping''' is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private [[conversation]] or [[communication]]s of others without their consent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Garner, p. 550{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is widely regarded as unethical, and in many jurisdictions is illegal.

==Etymology==
The verb ''eavesdrop'' is a back-formation from the noun ''eavesdropper'' ("a person who eavesdrops"), which was formed from the related noun ''eavesdrop'' ("the dripping of water from the eaves of a house; the ground on which such water falls").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eavesdrop|title=eavesdrop - Definition of eavesdrop in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eavesdropper was someone who would hang from the eave of a building so as to hear what is said within. The PBS documentaries, ''Inside the Court of Henry VIII'' (April 8, 2015)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Court of Henry VIII|url=https://www.pbs.org/program/inside-court-henry-viii/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secrets of Henry VIII’s Palace'' (June 30, 2013) include segments that display and discuss "eavedrops", carved wooden figures [[Henry VIII]] had built into the [[eaves]] (overhanging edges of the beams in the ceiling) of [[Hampton Court]] to discourage unwanted gossip or dissension from the King's wishes and rule, to foment paranoia and fear,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and demonstrate that everything said there was being overheard; literally, that the walls had ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stollznow, Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=August 7, 2014|title=Eavesdropping: etymology, meaning, and some creepy little statues|url=http://karenstollznow.com/eavesdropping/|website=KarenStollznow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Eavesdropping vectors include [[telephone]] lines, [[cellular network|cellular networks]], [[email]], and other methods of private instant messaging. [[VoIP]] communications software is also vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping via infections such as [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Network attacks==
Network eavesdropping is a network layer attack that focuses on capturing small ''packets'' from the network transmitted by other computers and reading the data content in search of any type of information. This type of network attack is generally one of the most effective as a lack of encryption services are used. It is also linked to the collection of metadata. Those who perform this type of attack are generally black hat hackers; however, government agencies, such as the [[National Security Agency]], have also been connected.

[[File:Shimer Class Chicago.PNG|thumb|An egalitarian dialogue at [[Shimer College]].]]
'''Egalitarian dialogue''' is a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them.  Although previously used widely in the [[social sciences]] and in reference to the [[Bakhtin]]ian philosophy of [[dialogue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bakhtin in contexts: across the disciplines |page=142
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=081011268X|isbn=081011268X
|first=Amy |last=Mandelker |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was first systematically applied to [[dialogical education]] by [[Ramón Flecha]] in his 2000 work ''Sharing Words. Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning''.

Egalitarian dialogue is one of the seven principles of [[dialogic learning]] (Flecha, 2000), the others being cultural intelligence, equality of differences, creation of meaning, instrumental dimension, solidarity, and transformation. The principle of egalitarian dialogue is deeply interrelated with the other principles of dialogic learning. By recognizing all people's [[cultural intelligence]] and respecting differences from an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] standpoint, egalitarian dialogue encourages individuals to create meaning, develop solidarity among different people, and create new instrumental dimensions. This interdependence among the principles of dialogic learning favors constant social transformation.

==Equality of differences==
The recognition and respect of different types of knowledge raises the awareness that each person has something to share, something different and equally important. Therefore, the wider the diversity of voices engaged in egalitarian dialogue, the better the knowledge that can be dialogically constructed. In this sense, dialogic learning is oriented towards equality of differences, stating that true equality includes the right to live in a different way (Flecha, 2000). This perspective, which [[Paulo Freire]] (1997) calls ''unity in diversity'', never defends diversity or difference without simultaneously proposing equality and fairness toward different individual and groups.

Equality of differences is also enacted in the Learning Communities (Valls, 2000; Elboj et al., 2001). The Learning Communities are schools in Spain, Brazil and Chile that have undergone a process of educational and social transformation based on dialogic learning. In the learning communities, the equality of differences principle is shown, among other practices, in the interactive groups (Aubert et al., 2004), where students and adults who have different levels of instruction and are from different backgrounds, teach and learn from each other. Those interactions create [[Zone of Proximal Development]] (Vygotsky, 1978), this showing that [[meaning-making]] and learning do not depend solely on the intervention of professionals, but on all the knowledge brought by anyone related to the students (Flecha, 2000).

==Creation of meaning==
Habermas (2004a, 2004b) has stressed the need to recover the [[lifeworld]] from its systemic colonization by the “steering media” of power, law and bureaucratization. The systemic decolonization is a way of reinventing democracy in public spaces and institutions and for recovering meaning. Habermas' concept of [[lifeworld]] refers to the everyday contexts where people relate to each other and create meaning and structures to organize themselves. In [[Habermas]]' view, and also from a dialogic learning perspective, subjects create meaning through [[intersubjectivity]] or the interaction among subjects engaged in egalitarian dialogue.

Any person can engage in such meaning making dialogue because humans have ''epistemological curiosity'', which when expressed in egalitarian dialogue can criticize and end with what Freire (2001) called the ''bureaucratizing of the mind'', an invisible power of alienating domestication. Such debureaucratization process can be seen in Dialogic Musical Gatherings (CONFAPEA, 2005), where people develop their epistemological curiosity listening to classical music and later engaging in a dialogue about the instruments that were playing, about the composer, his life and his position in a historical context, the style of the music listened to and its relationship with the cultural claims of each participant belonging to the Music Gathering, etc. In this process, meaning is created and recovered because music escapes the system and goes back to people's [[lifeworld]] tearing down the walls of cultural [[elitism]].

==Instrumental dimension==
The Instrumental Dimension of learning, as a principle of dialogic learning, should not be confused with instrumentality or the technocratic colonization of learning. In dialogic learning, as in [[Habermas]] (1984), the instrumental and [[communicative rationality]] are not opposed to each other, but instrumental learning becomes more intense and profound when situated in an adequate dialogical framework. The ability to select and process information is the cognitive tool that best enables one to function confidently in today's society. Dialogue and reflection encourage the development of that ability. Relationships with other people put not only diverse information but also its selection and processing at our disposal(Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16). In addition, "when dialogue is egalitarian, it encourages intense reflection, since people need to understand other positions and express their own" (Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16). In this sense, in egalitarian dialogue, procedures and ends are dialogically agreed. Those work for purposes of understanding, and do not let interactants hide themselves behind means that obscure exclusionary interests.

In education without dialogue, every single item becomes a target for power claims, even methods and instruments for learning, and therefore, the bureaucratization of those elements is inevitable. For this reason, the instrumental dimension of dialogic learning is never purely instrumental. It is also ethical, respectful, characterized by a sense of solidarity that contributes to break up the existing educational structure.

==Solidarity==
[[Social solidarity|Solidarity]] feeds dialogue, but at the same time, egalitarian dialogue, as essential communication, must underlie any act of solidarity (Freire, 1970). That is why, ''egalitarian educational practices must be grounded in conceptions of solidarity'' (Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;20).

The emphasis of [[dialogic learning]] on solidarity as the wheel that drives this perspective on education can be evidenced in the Learning Communities. For instance, in the School for Adults La Verneda-Sant Martí (Sánchez, 1999; Flecha, 2000) all the activities are open to anyone from the community and the city, and are also deeply integrated in the neighborhood. Because of discussing books from the classic literature through dialogic learning, the dialogic literary gatherings help improve the lives of the participants in the gathering but also of other people in the school and the neighborhood, when for example some participants in the gathering  take part of different committees of the school that plan actions of social transformation in the neighborhood, the city and beyond.

In this sense, solidarity is not only understood as an act for identifying and denouncing problems, but also as means to solve them. Solidarity does not only imply denouncing the process of dehumanization, but also announcing the dream of a new society (Freire, 2001). In this regard, solidarity goes beyond rebellious attitudes that do not propose an alternative, and reaches a more radically critical and dialogical position that implies the transformation of oneself, institutions, and the world.

An '''epiphany''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] ἐπιφάνεια, ''epiphaneia'', "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by [[psychologist]]s&lt;ref name="Jarvis1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2008"/&gt; and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of [[innovation]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeemingMadden2009"/&gt;

Epiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include [[Archimedes]]'s discovery of a method to determine the density of an object ("[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!") and [[Isaac Newton]]'s realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;

==History==
The word epiphany originally referred to insight through the [[divine]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platt, V. J. (2011) ''Facing the Gods. Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion''. Cambridge University Press.'' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is [[supernatural]], as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;

The word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist [[James Joyce]]. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it."&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, ''Epiphany in the Modern Novel.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. P. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment ''[[Stephen Hero]],'' although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]]).
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]]. From "L'atmosphère", book of 1888]]
In traditional and pre-modern cultures, [[initiation]] rites and [[western esotericism|mystery religion]]s have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The [[Greek drama]]tists and [[Greek poetry|poets]] would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of ''[[catharsis]]'' or ''[[kenosis]]'', respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of [[William Burroughs]]' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, "a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork." Both the [[Dadaist]] [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Pop Art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]] would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of [[fine art]] (for example a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal as a fountain]]), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of "what art is" or is not.

==Process==
Epiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kounios|first1=John|last2=Beeman|first2=Mark|title=The Aha! Moment: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=210–216|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01638.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.521.6014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt; The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt;

==Myth==
A common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt; Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that "the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems".&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ("I have found it!").&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt; The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly [[Albert Einstein]] was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in [[Bern]] and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, "a storm broke loose in my mind," which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called "the happiest thought of my life" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of [[holistic]] understanding in a prepared mind was said to give [[Charles Darwin]] his "hunch" (about [[natural selection]]), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story,&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt; and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Another myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-11"/&gt;

==In religion==
{{Further information|Epiphany (holiday)|theophany|hierophany}}
In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the [[Visit of the Magi]] as the [[revelation]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the infant Christ, and commemorate the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or [[Theophany]]) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by [[John the Baptist]] and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6.&lt;ref name="The Season of Epiphany"/&gt; Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either [[Ash Wednesday]], or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.

In more general terms, the phrase "religious epiphany" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to [[Arjuna]]'s realization that [[Krishna]] (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the "[[Bhagavad Gita]]") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be [[bodhodaya]], from Sanskrit [[bodha]] 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the [[bodhi]] tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining [[Nirvana]]. The Zen term ''[[kensho]]'' also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a ''[[koan]]''.

{{Globalize|date=July 2010}}

'''Fosterage''', the practice of a family bringing up a child not their own, differs from [[adoption]] in that the child's parents, not the foster-parents, remain the acknowledged parents. In many modern western societies [[foster care]] can be organised by the state to care for children with troubled family backgrounds, usually on a temporary basis.  In many pre-modern societies fosterage was a form of [[patronage]], whereby influential families cemented political relationships by bringing up each other's children, similar to [[arranged marriage]]s, also based on dynastic or alliance calculations.

This practice was once common in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fosterage|title=Fosterage
|publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Fosterage in the Hebrides==
In his ''[[A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland]]'' (1775), writer [[Samuel Johnson]] described the fosterage custom as he saw it practised.&lt;ref&gt;''A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland'' by Samuel Johnson. 1775 edition. [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/0/6/2064/2064.txt Gutenberg text] accessed May 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|There still remains in the [[Hebrides|Islands]], though it is passing fast away, the custom of fosterage.  A [[Laird]], a man of wealth and eminence, sends his child, either male or female, to a [[tacksman]], or tenant, to be fostered. It is not always his own tenant, but some distant friend that obtains this honour; for an honour such a trust is very reasonably thought.  The terms of fosterage seem to vary in different islands.  In [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], the father sends with his child a certain number of cows, to which the same number is added by the fosterer.  The father appropriates a proportionable extent of ground, without rent, for their pasturage.  If every cow brings a calf, half belongs to the fosterer, and half to the child; but if there be only one calf between two cows, it is the child's, and when the child returns to the parent, it is accompanied by all the cows given, both by the father and by the fosterer, with half of the increase of the stock by propagation.  These beasts are considered as a portion, and called Macalive cattle, of which the father has the produce, but is supposed not to have the full property, but to owe the same number to the child, as a portion to the daughter, or a stock for the son.

Children continue with the fosterer perhaps six years, and cannot, where this is the practice, be considered as burdensome.  The fosterer, if he gives four cows, receives likewise four, and has, while the child continues with him, grass for eight without rent, with half the calves, and all the milk, for which he pays only four cows when he dismisses his Dalt, for that is the name for a foster child.

Fosterage is, I believe, sometimes performed upon more liberal terms.  Our friend, the young Laird of Col, was fostered by Macsweyn of Grissipol. Macsweyn then lived a tenant to Sir James Macdonald in the Isle of Sky; and therefore Col, whether he sent him cattle or not, could grant him no land.  The Dalt, however, at his return, brought back a considerable number of Macalive cattle, and of the friendship so formed there have been good effects.  When Macdonald raised his rents, Macsweyn was, like other tenants, discontented, and, resigning his farm, removed from Sky to Col, and was established at Grissipol.}}

==Fosterage in Medieval Iceland==
Fosterage or "fostering" is frequently referred to in the medieval [[Sagas of Icelanders]].  Original family ties and rights of inheritance were not affected, nor was it required for the fostered child to be an orphan or for the biological father to be deceased. Moreover, the fostering of another man's child was regarded as a source of honor to the birth father; and conventionally the fostering party was  of inferior social status to the biological father. An exception to this convention is found in [[Njáls saga]], where [[Njáll Þorgeirsson|Njál Thorgeirsson]], a very prominent man, fosters Hoskuld, the son of Thrain Sigfusson, after the death of Thrain in battle.
 
Portions of Ireland, Scotland and the Hebrides were ruled for long periods of time by Norse invaders during the Middle Ages; but it is unknown which culture was the original source of the custom of fosterage.

==Literary fosterage==
In [[Ancient Ireland]], [[ollam]]s taught children either for payment or for no compensation. Children were taught a particular trade and treated like family; their original family ties were often severed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.libraryireland.com/Brehon-Laws/Fosterage.php|title=Fosterage in Ancient Ireland|publisher=Library Ireland|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fosterage in other cultures==

There was similar custom in the [[Caucasus]], called Atalik - [[:ru:Аталычество]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4065">'''GLAM''' is an [[acronym]] for "[[art museum|galleries]], [[library|libraries]], [[archive]]s, and [[museum]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Australian Society of Archivists, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030801224434/http://www.archivists.org.au/events/conf2003/ Australian Society of Archivists Annual Conference - GLAM], 17–20 September 2003, Hilton, Adelaide.[https://books.google.com/books/about/Glam.html?id=fRwMRAAACAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC Wiki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/GLAM|title=GLAM - CC Wiki|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[cultural institutions]] that have access to knowledge as their mission.

Various versions of the acronym exist, such as '''LAM''', which leaves out galleries, which may be seen as a subset of museums, and may be confused with commercial galleries where art is bought and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BibSI |url=http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |title=On the LAM: Library, Archive, and Museum Collections in the Creation and Maintenance of Knowledge Communities &amp;#124; BibSI |publisher=Bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305191920/http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |archivedate=2014-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lam.alaska.gov/ |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090501071432/http%3A//lam%2Ealaska%2Egov/ |archivedate= May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LAM DNA August 4, 2005 by Jim |url=http://hangingtogether.org/?p=15 |title=Blog Archive » LAM DNA |publisher=hangingtogether.org |date=2005-08-04 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLAMR is another variant which includes Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Conference - Australian Society of Archivists|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/2017-conference|website=www.archivists.org.au|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, GLAMs are institutions in the public interest, collecting [[cultural heritage]] materials.

The term LAM has been in use at least since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_saAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=LAM+libraries+archives+museums&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=E-LAM|title=Information Retrieval &amp; Library Automation|date=1997|publisher=Lomond Systems.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as these institutions saw their missions overlapping, creating the need for a wider industry sector grouping. This became apparent as they placed their collections online—artworks, books, documents, and artifacts all effectively becoming "information resources."

Proponents of greater collaboration argue that the present convergence is actually a return to traditional unity. These institutions share epistemological links dating from the [[Library of Alexandria|“Museum” of Alexandria]] and continuing through the [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] gathered in early modern Europe. Over time as collections expanded, they became more specialized and their housing was separated according to the form of information and kinds of users. Furthermore, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries distinct professional societies and educational programs developed for each kind of institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Archives, Libraries, Museums: Coming Back Together?|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/libraries_and_culture/v049/49.1.marcum.html|journal = Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 2166-3033|pages = 74-89|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/lac.2014.0001|first = Deanna|last = Marcum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As collecting institutions, GLAMs preserve and make accessible primary sources valuable for researchers.

[[File:Purple_circle_100%25.svg|thumb| A purple circle is a symbol for gender neutrality, derived from the two [[gender symbols]]' colours mixed together, and without the distinguishing cross or arrow used in the gender symbols (♂ and ♀).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}]]

A '''gender-blind''' (or '''unisex''') person is someone who adheres to not distinguishing people by gender. Gender blind people generally advocate [[gender neutrality]] in society, such as activities undertaken and services provided without regard to the [[gender]] of those who participate. Those who identify as [[pansexual]] may also refer to themselves as 'gender-blind': however, pansexuality emphasizes gender-blindness in [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

== Choice of words ==
{{Main|Gender neutral language}}

''Unisex'' is an older term, and a [[misnomer]] meaning "one sex". It should not be confused with [[bisexuality]].
''Gender-blind'' however goes against most tenets of [[heteronormativity]] by not looking at gender at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== The National Student Genderblind Campaign ==

In 2006 the National Student Genderblind Campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genderblind.org|title=Khóa Học Kế Toán Thực Hành Uy Tín Tại TPHCM – Một trang web mới sử dụng WordPress|website=www.genderblind.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a collaborative [[grassroots]] organization intended to educate [[college]] students, administrators, and others throughout the United States. The NSGC advocates for the implementation of gender-inclusive [[dormitory|dorm]] room and [[washroom|bathroom]] options.

==Mixed-gender hospital rooms==

The use of mixed-gender hospital rooms has proved controversial in both the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Miner, Shared room sparks rage,London Free Press, June 17, 2010, http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2010/06/16/14417821.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Manitoba's Health Minister, [[Theresa Oswald]], has campaigned actively against such rooms after receiving complaints from a Winnipeg patient, Ollie Ingram.&lt;ref name = Owen&gt;Bruce Owen, Oswald vows action to stop coed rooms in hospitals, Winnipeg Free Press, May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Oswald said if humanity can "put somebody on the moon", it can find a way to honor gender requests without leading to delays for patients.&lt;ref name = Owen/&gt;  At the same time, some medical ethicists have been critical of efforts to return to single-sex rooms.&lt;ref name = Owen/&gt;   [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]], an advocate for mixed rooms in the United States, has written that opposition to gender-mixed rooms stems from "old-fashioned prejudice" and argues that: "Because some people have been brought up to fear or dislike sharing a room with a person of the opposite sex, or blush at the prospect of catching a glimpse of an unwelcome body part when a robe slips open, we enshrine and perpetuate this prejudice in social policy."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Appel, Are We Ready for Coed Hospital Rooms? ''Huffington Post'', June 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain has agreed to phase out such rooms by 2010.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Much as with [[Color blindness (race)|similar approaches to dealing with racism and ethnicity]], not recognising and taking account of participants' sex can be harmful. It posits that it functions in a post-sexism society where women are no longer treated differently than men on the basis of their sex. Meanwhile, gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women-only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women's inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case. A guide for women’s organisations|date=July 2011|publisher=Women's Resource Centre|page=18|url=https://thewomensresourcecentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Making-the-case-for-women-only-July-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal test of the "reasonable person" has been criticised for being genderblind to be applied in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. Women are subjected to more normalised and endemic sexual harassment than men. On the grounds of this, the American case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that "a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McCammon,|editor1-first=Holly J.|editor2-last=Taylor|editor2-first=Verta|editor3-last=Reger|editor3-first=Jo|editor4-last=Einwohner|editor4-first=Rachel L.|title=The Oxford Handbook of U.S. Women's Social Movement Activism|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Studies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. Of 1000 women polled by the Women's Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case. A guide for women’s organisations|date=July 2011|publisher=Women's Resource Centre|page=15|url=https://thewomensresourcecentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Making-the-case-for-women-only-July-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-sex services can have a benefit in providing greater comfort and engaging participants who would otherwise not get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case. A guide for women’s organisations|date=July 2011|publisher=Women's Resource Centre|page=17|url=https://thewomensresourcecentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Making-the-case-for-women-only-July-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Humanities Indicators''' is a project of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] that equips researchers and policymakers, universities, foundations, museums, libraries, humanities councils and other public institutions with statistical tools for answering basic questions about primary and secondary humanities education, undergraduate and graduate education in the [[humanities]], the humanities workforce, levels and sources of program funding, public understanding and impact of the humanities, and other areas of concern in the humanities community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/First-National-Picture-of/1437 ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', "First National Picture of Trends in the Humanities Is Unveiled"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/system/inTheNews.aspx Indicators in the News].&lt;/ref&gt;

== The genre of invective ==
The "genre of invective" or "invective (genre)" or "''vituperatio''" in Latin is a form of classical libel used in [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Roman]] polemical verse as well as in prose, but its primary context is rhetoric.

The rhetorical genre of ''vituperatio'' belongs to the ''genus demonstrativum'', which is composed by the praise and blame.

During the Roman Republic, personal invectives and character assassination were widely used during the forensic speeches as well as orations. Cicero made a large use of the invectives against his political foes such as Clodius, Catilina (Catilinarian speeches) or Mark Antony (Philippics). The commonly charges are avarice, cupidity, cowardice, effeminacy, drunkenness, low writing and speaking skills, luxury, disapproved sexual habits, tyrannical behaviour, etc.

Between 44 BC and 30 BC, the invective became a tool during the propaganda war between Octavian and Mark Antony&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le conflit propagandiste entre Octavien et Marc Antoine. De l'usage politique de la uituperatio entre 44 et 30 a. C. n.|last=Borgies|first=Loïc|publisher=Latomus|year=2016|isbn=978-90-429-3459-7|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among many other slanders, Mark Antony was accused to have married a foreign queen Cleopatra, to be the submissive subject of her and to have lose his Roman identity. According to this propaganda, Cleopatra would plan to invade Italia. This propaganda before the battle of Actium in 31 BC permits to Octavian to present his campaign as a legitimate war for the safe of the Roman Republic.

The preferred literary term for invective of the [[Renaissance]] is [[Libel (poetry)|libel]].

'''Katabasis''' or '''catabasis''' ({{lang-grc|κατάβασις}}, from {{lang|grc|κατὰ}} "down" and {{lang|grc|βαίνω}} "go") is a descent of some type, such as moving downhill, the sinking of the winds or sun, a military retreat, a trip to the [[underworld]], or a trip from the interior of a country down to the coast. The term has multiple related meanings in poetry, rhetoric, and modern psychology.

==A trip to the coast==
The term catabasis can refer to a trip from the interior of a country down to the coast (for example, following a river), in contrast to the term "[[wikt:anabasis|anabasis]]", which refers to an expedition from a coastline up into the interior of a country.

The main meaning given for catabasis by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') describes "A going down; a military retreat, in allusion to that of the ten thousand Greeks under [[Xenophon]], related by him in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|''Anabasis'']]:
{{quotation|1837 [[Thomas De Quincey|DE QUINCEY]] ''Revolt Tartars Wks''. 1862 IV. 112 The Russian anabasis and catabasis of Napoleon. 1899 ''Westm. Gaz.'' 17 May 4/1 Little space is devoted to the ''Anabasis''; it is, as in the story of Xenophon, the ''Catabasis'' which fills the larger part.| [[Oxford English Dictionary]] - catabasis}}

In the opening of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'', [[Socrates]] recounts "going down" to the port city of [[Piraeus]], located south of his native [[Athens]].  Several scholars, including [[Allan Bloom]], have read this first word, {{lang|grc|κατέβην}} ("I went down") as an allusion to [[Odysseus]]' journey into the [[underworld]].

==Arts==
In [[poetry]] and [[rhetoric]], the term ''katabasis'' refers to a "gradual descending" of emphasis on a theme within a sentence or paragraph, while ''anabasis'' refers to a gradual ascending in emphasis. John Freccero notes, "In the ancient world, [the] descent in search of understanding was known as katabasis",{{sfn|Freccero|1988|p=108}} thus endowing mythic and poetic accounts of katabasis with a symbolic significance.

==Modern psychology==
In modern psychology, the term ''katabasis'' is sometimes used to describe the [[depression (mood)|depression]] some young men experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.org.uk/picasso/jung_article.html Jung's 1932 Article on Picasso]&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Robert Bly]] proposes in his book ''[[Iron John: A Book About Men]]'' several reasons for the "catabasis phenomenon", amongst them the lack of Western [[initiation rite]]s and the lack of strong [[father figure]]s and [[role model]]s.

==Trip into the underworld==
The trip to the underworld is a [[mytheme]] of [[comparative mythology]] found in a diverse number of religions from around the world. The [[hero]] or upper-world deity journeys to the [[underworld]] or to the land of the dead and returns, often with a [[quest]]-object or a loved one, or with heightened knowledge. The ability to enter the realm of the dead while still alive, and to return, is a proof of the classical hero's exceptional status as more than mortal. A deity who returns from the underworld demonstrates [[Eschatology|eschatological]] themes such as the cyclical nature of time and existence, or the defeat of death and the possibility of [[immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2005|p=98}}; {{harvnb|Edmonds III|2004||loc=''passim''}}; {{harvnb|Collins|Fishbane|1995|loc=''passim''}}; and {{harvnb|Louden|2011|pp=197–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Katabasis'' is the epic convention of the hero's trip into the [[underworld]].{{sfn|Serrano|1999|pp=129–179}} In [[Greek mythology]], for example, [[Orpheus]] enters the underworld in order to bring [[Eurydice]] back to the world of the living.

Most ''katabases'' take place in a supernatural underworld, such as [[Hades]] or [[Hell]] —  as in [[Nekyia]], the 11th book of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', which describes [[Odysseus]]'s descent to the underworld. However, ''katabas''is can also refer to a journey through other ''dystopi''c areas, like those Odysseus encounters on his 10-year journey back from [[Troy]] to [[Ithaca]]. Pilar Serrano{{sfn|Serrano|1999|pp=129–179}} allows the term ''katabasis'' to encompass brief or chronic stays in the underworld, including those of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], and [[Castor and Pollux]].  In this case, however, the ''katabasis'' must be followed by an ''[[wikt:anabasis|anabasis]]'' (a going or marching up) in order to be considered a true ''katabasis'' instead of a death.

=== The ''Odyssey'' ===
[[File:Alessandro Allori - Odysseus questions the seer Tiresias.jpg|thumb|Odysseus consults the soul of the prophet Tiresias in his ''katabasis'' during the 11th book of the ''Odyssey.'']]
In the 11th book of the ''Odyssey'', Odysseus follows the advice of Circe and consults Tiresias in the land of the dead.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=10: 504 – 11: 50}} During Odysseus' visit, the souls of many appear to him. The first to appear to Odysseus is [[Elpenor]], his crew member who died prior to leaving Circe's island. Elpenor asks Odysseus to give him a proper burial, and Odysseus agrees.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 51–83}}  The next to appear to Odysseus is his mother, [[Anticlea]]. As Odysseus has been away fighting the Trojan War for nearly 20 years, he is surprised and saddened by the sight of her soul.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 84–89}}

[[Tiresias]], the soul whom Odysseus came to see, next appears to him. Tiresias gives him several pieces of information concerning his ''[[nostos]]'' (homecoming) and his life after. Tiresias details [[Poseidon|Poseidon's]] anger at Odysseus' blinding of [[Polyphemus|Polyphemos]] (and the coming troubles as a consequence), warns Odysseus not to eat the livestock of the god [[Helios]], and prophesies Odysseus' return home to [[Ithaca]] and his eventual death at sea at an old age.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 90–137}} After Tiresias instructs Odysseus to allow the spirits he wants to talk to drink the sacrificial blood he used to find Tiresias, he is again given the chance to see his mother, and she tells him of the suffering of his family as they await his return home.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 145–224}} As his mother leaves, Odysseus is then visited by a string of souls of past queens. He first sees [[Tyro]], the mother of [[Pelias]] and [[Neleus]] by Poseidon.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 235–259}}

He next talks to [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]], the mother of [[Amphion and Zethus]] (the founders of Thebes) by [[Zeus]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 260–265}} Then, he is visited by [[Alcmene]], the mother of [[Heracles]] by Zeus, and Heracle's wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 266–270}} He is also visited by [[Jocasta|Epicaste,]] the mother of Oedipus, and [[Chloris]], the queen of [[Pylos]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 271–285}} Odysseus is then visited by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], the mother of [[Castor and Pollux|Castor and Polydeuces]] and [[Iphimedeia]], mother of the [[Aloadae]] by Poseidon.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 298–320}} Odysseus then sees a list of women whom he only briefly mentions: [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Procris]], [[Ariadne]], Maera, [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]], and [[Eriphyle]], all also lovers of gods or heroes.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 321–332}} Next to visit Odysseus is [[Agamemnon]], the king of [[Mycenae]]. Agamemnon tells Odysseus of his death by his wife, [[Clytemnestra]] and her lover [[Aegisthus]]. He warns Odysseus to return to Ithaca in secret and be wary of his own wife.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 385–461}}

Odysseus then encounters [[Achilles]], who asks after the well being of his father, [[Peleus]], and his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. Odysseus reassures Achilles of his son's bravery in fighting the Trojans.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 466–540}} Odysseus then begins seeing figures of dead souls who do not talk directly to him: [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], [[Minos]], [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], [[Tityos]], [[Tantalus]], and [[Sisyphus]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 550–600}} Odysseus ends his visit with Heracles, who asks about Odysseus' intention in Hades. Odysseus begins to get fearful as he waits for more heroes and leaves.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 601–640}}
[[File:Scene from Virgil's Aeneid; the Cumaean Sibyl leads Aeneas t Wellcome V0042049.jpg|thumb|The Cumaean Sibyl leads Aeneas to the Underworld for his katabasis in the ''Aeneid.'']]

=== The ''Aeneid'' ===
The ''katabasis'' of Virgil's ''Aeneid'' occurs in book 6 of the epic. Unlike Odysseus, Aeneas seeks to enter the underworld, rather than bring the spirits of the dead to him through sacrifice. He begins his journey with a visit to the Cumaean Sibyl (a priestess of Apollo) and asks for her assistance to journey to the underworld and visit his father.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 1–124}} The priestess tells him to find a golden branch, and if the branch breaks off in his hands, he is fated to go to the underworld. She also tells Aeneas to bury his dead friend and prepare cattle for sacrifice.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 125–155}} When Aeneas reaches the forest to find the golden branch, he is guided by birds to the tree, and the branch breaks into his hand. The branch, however, does not easily break off as the Sibyl said would happen to a person fated to go to the Underworld - the branch is described as "cunctantem" ("hesitant"). The implications of this have been debated by scholars - some arguing that it means that Aeneas is not as heroic as he needs to be, others arguing that Aeneas has not yet fulfilled his destiny, and several arguing that he is still a hero, with this section added purely for drama. Aeneas buries Misenus and he and the Sibyl prepare a sacrifice to enter the underworld.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 176–267}} Aeneas first encounters several beings and monsters as he enters: Sorrows, Heartaches, Diseases, Senility, Terror, Hunger, Evil, Crime, Poverty, Death, Hard Labor, Sleep, Evil Pleasures of Mind, War, Family Vengeance, Mad Civil Strife, [[Scylla]], [[Hekatonkheires|Briareus]], Hydra, [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimaera]], [[Gorgon]]s, [[Harpy|Harpies]], and [[Cerberus]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 268–294}} Next, Aeneas encounters [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], the ferryman who leads souls into the underworld, and the mass of people who are unburied.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 295–332}} His first conversation is with Palinurus, a man of his crew who fell overboard and died on their journey. Palinurus begs Aeneas to bury him so he can enter the underworld.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 337–383}} The Sibyl convinces Charon to carry them across the river Styx in exchange for the golden bough.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 384–416}} Aeneas encounters Minos pronouncing judgment on souls and the souls that died for love: [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Procris]], [[Eriphyle]], [[Evadne]], [[Pasiphaë|Pasiphae]], [[Laodamia]], [[Caeneus]], and [[Dido]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 426–451}} Next, Aeneas sees heroes of battle: [[Tydeus]], Parthenopaeus, [[Adrastus]], [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaucus]], [[Medon]], Thersilochus, [[Polybotes|Polyboetes]], Idaeus, [[Agamemnon]], and [[Deiphobus]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 477–534}} The Sibyl then leads Aeneas to Elysium, the place for the blessed. On the way, they pass the place for tortured souls and the Sibyl describes some of the tortured's fates. Tityos has his liver eaten by a vulture daily. Pirithous and Ixion have a rock constantly hanging over them at all times. Many others face the punishment of moving rocks, being stretched, and being tied to wheels.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 548–636}} The two then enter the Estates of the Blessed, where they see a utopian land where heroes and good people reside. There, Aeneas finds his father, who tells him of the rich history of Rome to come.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 637–901}}

=== The Metamorphoses ===
In Ovid's poetic collection of mythological stories, he includes accounts of ''katabasis'' as well. In book 4, he includes an account of Juno's descent to Hades to bring her perceived justice to Ino.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 578–617}} Ovid describes Juno's path to the underworld, noting Cerberus' presence.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 594–617}} Juno seeks the Furies (Tisiphone, Megara, and [[Alecto]]) to destroy the house of [[Cadmus]], namely Ino and her husband [[Athamas]]. While in the underworld, Juno passes several souls who are being punished in Hades. Hades is also a person, and he needs to get rid of those souls because he needs them to fully recover. –[[Tantalus]], [[Sisyphus]], [[Ixion]], and the [[Daughters of Danaus|Belides]].{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 624–634}} When the Furies agree to Juno's request, she happily returns to the heavens where she is purified by Iris.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 649–659}}

[[File:Orpheus &amp; Euridice.jpg|thumb|Orpheus travels out of the underworld followed by the shade of his wife, Eurydice.]]
The next major ''katabasis'' in the ''Metamorphoses'' occurs in book 5 by [[Proserpina]], the daughter of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] who is kidnapped by [[Saturn (mythology)|Dis]]. As Proserpina is picking flowers, Dis falls in love with her and decides to grab her and take her to the underworld in his chariot. Worried about her now-missing daughter, Ceres becomes distraught and searches for Proserpina.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 552–615}}

When Ceres discovers the kidnapping, she goes to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] to attempt to get Proserpina back. He agrees that she should be returned as long as Proserpina has not touched any food in the underworld. However, she has eaten pomegranate seeds, and cannot be returned to Ceres.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 658–712}} To ensure compromise between Ceres and Dis, Jove divides the year into halves and commands that Proserpina must spend equal parts of the year between her mother and her husband. From that point on, Proserpina makes annual trips to the underworld, spending half the year there.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 739–746}}

Ovid also briefly mentions the ''katabasis'' of Hercules in book 7. Ovid is telling the etiological story of [[Medea|Medea's]] poison for [[Theseus]]. When Hercules travelled to the underworld to capture Cerberus as one of his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve Labours]], Cerberus spread white foam from his mouths which grew poisonous plants.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=7: 575–595}}

The ''katabasis'' of [[Orpheus]] in book 10 is the last major inclusion of the theme by Ovid in the ''Metamorphoses''. Orpheus is distraught by the death of his wife, [[Eurydice]]. He enters the underworld through the Spartan Gates and visits Dis and Proserpina to beg for the return of his bride. Overcome by the heartfelt song of Orpheus, Proserpina calls Eurydice to leave with her husband–on the condition that he does not look back until he reaches the exit. When he looks back, his wife disappears, and he is pained by grief for her death a second time.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=10: 1–110}}

==Wind==
{{main|Katabatic wind}}
Air cooled by a glacier flows down the glacier and generates wind movement known as a ''katabatic wind''. In Antarctica, katabatic winds perpetually flow off the Antarctic plateau and are channelled through mountain passes, descending down steep glaciers to the oceans. They blow at storm force year round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/southpole/577 Climate: The South Pole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918055013/http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/SouthPole/577 |date=2008-09-18 }} [http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html Stanford Humanities Lab], Retrieved 2008-10-01   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920222812/http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html |date=2008-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Legal syllogism''' is a legal concept concerning the law and its application. It is based upon deductive reasoning applied for the sake of law, hence it is also called '''legal deduction''' or '''deductive legal reasoning'''.

In legal syllogism there are two premises, minor and major, and one conclusion.

The place of the major premise is taken by a legal norm (or rule). This norm (rule) may be derived from canonical text (text of statutes, constitutions, regulations, international treaties and agreements, ordinances, bylaws etc) or from a judicial precedent. In the latter case, it can be called ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' or ruling. In the main, it can be considered as a general expression which, in generic terms, states what one ought to do or ought not to do in a certain type of circumstances. 

The facts of the case at hand (also called pending, instant, ''[[sub judice]]'', at bar or under argument) serve as the minor premise. These facts may be understood as all elements of the factual setting of the case at hand, i.e. the details of the events, things and persons which occurred in a case to which the rule/norm that constitutes the major premise is to be applied deductively.

The conclusion is formed by the legal consequence for the case at hand.

If the norm that forms the major premise is valid (binding in a given legal system) and the facts of the case at hand are proven or posited as true, the conclusion of legal syllogism which flows from subsuming these facts under this norm (rule) is supposed to be correct as well.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning." The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no 1/2017: 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Intricacies, Fallacy and Madness of Legal Deduction." Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie no. 4/2017: 495-496.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that sense, legal syllogism can be deemed to be equally infallible  as 'ordinary' ('logical') [[syllogism]]. Such a claim is, however, ill-founded and, in fact, subsumption of a concrete case under a general rule proves to be a value-laden and goal-oriented process. Neither is it 'logical', nor 'mechanical'.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning." The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no 1/2017: 76-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Intricacies, Fallacy and Madness of Legal Deduction."

In reasoning to [[argument|argue]] a claim, a [[fallacy]] is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect and that undermines the [[Validity (logic)|logical validity]] of the argument and permits its recognition as [[soundness|unsound]]. Regardless of their soundness, all registers and manners of speech can demonstrate fallacies.

Because of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or content, such as classifying them as [[Formal fallacy|formal fallacies]] or [[Informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006" /&gt; On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as [[Material fallacy|material fallacies]] (content), [[Verbal fallacy|verbal fallacies]] (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies, while formal fallacies may be clearly placed into the more precise category of logical (deductive) fallacies.{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=This needs examples, and/or to be broken into different sentences—this is difficult to follow, and "in turn" to what? The previous sentence? Things within this long sentence?}} Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed into either informal or deductive classifications; compare [[equivocation]] which is a word or phrase based [[ambiguity]], e. g. "he is mad", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the [[fallacy of composition]] which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. "this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=fallacy |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/fallacy#toc280530 |publisher= Encyclopedia Brittanica |website= Brittanica.com |accessdate= 13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulty inferences in [[deductive reasoning]] are common formal or logical fallacies. As the nature of [[inductive reasoning]] is based on [[probability]], a fallacious inductive argument or one that is potentially misleading, is often classified as "weak".

The conscious or habitual use of fallacies as [[rhetorical device]]s are prevalent in the desire to persuade when the focus is more on communication and eliciting common agreement rather than the correctness of the reasoning. The effective use of a fallacy by an orator may be considered clever, but by the same token, the reasoning of that orator should be recognized as unsound, and thus the orator's claim, supported by an unsound argument, will be regarded as unfounded and dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hornby |first1=A.S. |title= Oxford advanced learner's dictionary of current English |date=2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [England] |isbn= 978-0194799003 |edition=8th |quote= sophist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal fallacies ==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}
A formal fallacy is an error in logic that can be seen in the [[argument form|argument's form]].{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067957_ss1-95 "formal fallacy"]}} All formal fallacies are specific types of [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequiturs]].  
* [[Appeal to probability]] – a statement that takes something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might be the case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leon|first1=Joseph|title=Appeal to Probability|url=http://logical-critical-thinking.com/logical-fallacy/appeal-to-probability/|website=Logical &amp; Critical Thinking|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927130844/http://logical-critical-thinking.com/logical-fallacy/appeal-to-probability/|archivedate=27 September 2013|date=23 April 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Simon|title=Appeal to probability|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/deductive-logic-arguments/appeal-to-probability-1|website=Toolkit For Thinking|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219013634/http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/deductive-logic-arguments/appeal-to-probability-1|archivedate=19 February 2015|date=2009|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Argument from fallacy]] (also known as the fallacy fallacy) – assumption that if an ''argument'' for some conclusion is fallacious, then the ''conclusion'' is false.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/fallfall.html "Fallacy Fallacy"]}}
* [[Base rate fallacy]] – making a probability judgment based on [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]], without taking into account the effect of [[prior probability|prior probabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Base%20Rate%20Fallacy |title=Base Rate Fallacy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work=Psychology Glossary |publisher=AlleyDog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conjunction fallacy]] – assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/conjunction_fallacy.htm |title=Conjunction Fallacy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work=ChangingMinds.org |last=Straker |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Masked-man fallacy]] (illicit substitution of identicals) – the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/illisubs.html "The Masked Man Fallacy"]}}

=== Propositional fallacies ===
A propositional fallacy is an error in logic that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: &lt;and&gt;, &lt;or&gt;, &lt;not&gt;, &lt;only if&gt;, &lt;if and only if&gt;). The following fallacies involve inferences whose correctness is not guaranteed by the behavior of those logical connectives, and hence, which are not logically guaranteed to yield true conclusions.
&lt;br /&gt;Types of [[Propositional calculus|propositional]] fallacies:
* [[Affirming a disjunct]] – concluding that one disjunct of a [[logical disjunction]] must be false because the other disjunct is true; ''A or B; A, therefore not B''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}
* [[Affirming the consequent]] – the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] in an indicative conditional is claimed to be true because the [[consequent]] is true; ''if A, then B; B, therefore A''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}
* [[Denying the antecedent]] – the [[consequent]] in an [[indicative conditional]] is claimed to be false because the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is false; ''if A, then B; not A, therefore not B''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}

=== Quantification fallacies ===
A quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion.
&lt;br /&gt; Types of [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] fallacies:
* [[Existential fallacy]] – an argument that has a universal premise and a particular conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}

=== Formal syllogistic fallacies ===
[[Syllogistic fallacy|Syllogistic fallacies]] – logical fallacies that occur in [[syllogisms]].
* [[Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise]] (illicit negative) – a categorical [[syllogism]] has a positive conclusion, but at least one negative premise.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of exclusive premises]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of four terms]] (''quaternio terminorum'') – a categorical syllogism that has four terms.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|pp=133–36}}
* [[Illicit major]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is not [[distribution of terms|distributed]] in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Illicit minor]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is not distributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Negative conclusion from affirmative premises]] (illicit affirmative) – a categorical syllogism has a negative conclusion but affirmative premises.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of the undistributed middle]] – the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|pp=316–17}}
* [[Modal fallacy]] – confusing possibility with necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/127/Modal_Scope_Fallacy|title=Modal (Scope) Fallacy|last=Bennett|first=Bo|date=|website=Logically Fallacious|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Informal fallacies ==
{{Main|Informal fallacy}}
Informal fallacies – arguments that are fallacious for reasons other than structural (formal) flaws and usually require examination of the argument's content.{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679510_ss1-120 "informal fallacy"]}}
* [[Argument to moderation]] (false compromise, middle ground, fallacy of the mean, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad temperantiam}}'') – assuming that the compromise between two positions is always correct.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=150}}
* [[Continuum fallacy]] (fallacy of the beard, line-drawing fallacy, sorites fallacy, fallacy of the heap, bald man fallacy) – improperly rejecting a claim for being imprecise.{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Line-Drawing "Line-Drawing"]}}
* [[Correlative-based fallacies]]
** [[Suppressed correlative]] – a correlative is redefined so that one alternative is made impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethical Theory: An Anthology |chapter=Psychological Egoism |page=193 |first=Joel |last=Feinberg |editor-first=Russ |editor-last=Shafer-Landau |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |series=Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-3320-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By9nCkAvS6EC&amp;pg=PT211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Divine fallacy]] (argument from incredulity) – arguing that, because something is so incredible or amazing, it must be the result of superior, divine, alien or paranormal agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Robert T.|authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]|url=http://skepdic.com/dvinefal.html|title=divine fallacy (argument from incredulity)|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Double counting (fallacy)|Double counting]] – counting events or occurrences more than once in probabilistic reasoning, which leads to the sum of the probabilities of all cases exceeding [[unity (number)|unity]].
* [[Equivocation]] – the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time).{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=121}}
** [[Ambiguous middle term]] – a common ambiguity in syllogisms in which the [[middle term]] is equivocated.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=206}}
** Definitional retreat – changing the meaning of a word to deal with an objection raised against the original wording.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pirie|first=Madsen|authorlink=Madsen Pirie|title=How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=10 September 2015|year=2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-9006-3|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Motte-and-bailey fallacy – The arguer conflates two similar positions, one modest and easy to defend (the "motte") and one much more controversial (the "bailey"). The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position.&lt;ref name="mott-and-bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shackel|first1=Nicholas|title=The Vacuity of Postmodernist Methodology|journal=[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]]|date=2005|volume=36|issue=3|quote=For my purposes the desirable but only lightly defensible territory of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|Motte and Bailey castle]], that is to say, the Bailey, represents a philosophical doctrine or position with similar properties: desirable to its proponent but only lightly defensible. The Motte is the defensible but undesired position to which one retreats when hard pressed...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Accent (fallacy)|Fallacy of accent]] – a specific type of ambiguity that arises when the meaning of a sentence is changed by placing an unusual prosodic stress, or when, in a written passage, it's left unclear which word the emphasis was supposed to fall on.
** {{crossref|printworthy=y|(See also the [[#If-by-whiskey|if-by-whiskey]] fallacy, below.)}}
* [[Ecological fallacy]] – inferences about the nature of specific individuals are based solely upon aggregate statistics collected for the group to which those individuals belong.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=119}}
* [[Etymological fallacy]] – reasoning that the original or historical meaning of a word or phrase is necessarily similar to its actual present-day usage.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=70}}
* [[Fallacy of composition]] – assuming that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=31}}
* [[Fallacy of division]] – assuming that something true of a thing must also be true of all or some of its parts.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=53}}
* [[False attribution]] – an advocate appeals to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased or fabricated source in support of an argument.
** [[Fallacy of quoting out of context]] (contextotomy, contextomy; quotation mining) – refers to the selective excerpting of words from their original context in a way that distorts the source's intended meaning.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=97}}
* [[False authority]] (single authority) – using an expert of dubious credentials or using only one opinion to sell a product or idea.  Related to the [[appeal to authority]] (not always fallacious).
* [[False dilemma]] (false dichotomy, fallacy of bifurcation, black-or-white fallacy) – two alternative statements are held to be the only possible options when in reality there are more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/false-dilemma.html |title=Fallacy – False Dilemma |accessdate=2011-02-01 |publisher=The Nizkor Project |work=Nizkor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[False equivalence]] – describing a situation of logical and apparent equivalence, when in fact there is none.
* [[Historian's fallacy]] – the assumption that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and had the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=209}} (Not to be confused with [[presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], which is a mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas, such as moral standards, are projected into the past.)
* [[Historical fallacy]] – a set of considerations is thought to hold good only because a completed process is read into the content of the process which conditions this completed result.&lt;ref&gt;"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology", John Dewey, ''The Psychological Review'', Vol. III. No. 4. July 1896. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Homunculus fallacy]] – a "middle-man" is used for explanation; this sometimes leads to regressive middle-men. Explains without actually explaining the real nature of a function or a process. Instead, it explains the concept in terms of the concept itself, without first defining or explaining the original concept. Explaining thought as something produced by a little thinker, a sort of [[homunculus]] inside the head, merely explains it as another kind of thinking (as different but the same).{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120113200604/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?query=homunculus&amp;widen=1&amp;result_number=1&amp;book_id=g9781405106795_9781405106795&amp;from=search&amp;fuzzy=0&amp;type=std&amp;id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067959_ss1-77&amp;slop=1 "Homunculus"]}}
* {{vanchor|Inflation of conflict}} – arguing that if experts of a field of knowledge disagree on a certain point, the experts must know nothing, and therefore no conclusion can be reached, or that the legitimacy of their entire field is put to question.&lt;ref name="Fallacious Arguments"&gt;{{cite web|title=A List Of Fallacious Arguments|url=http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{vanchor|[[If-by-whiskey]]}} – an argument that supports both sides of an issue by using terms that are selectively emotionally sensitive.
* [[Incomplete comparison]] – insufficient information is provided to make a complete comparison.
* [[Inconsistent comparison]] – different methods of comparison are used, leaving a false impression of the whole comparison.
* [[Intentional Fallacy|Intentionality fallacy]] – the insistence that the ultimate meaning of an expression must be consistent with the intention of the person from whom the communication originated (e.g. a work of fiction that is widely received as a blatant allegory must necessarily not be regarded as such if the author intended it not to be so.)&lt;ref&gt;[[W.K.

* [[Ludic fallacy]] – the belief that the outcomes of non-regulated random occurrences can be encapsulated by a statistic; a failure to take into account [[there are known knowns|unknown unknowns]] in determining the probability of events taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nassim |last=Taleb |title=The Black Swan |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |isbn=1-4000-6351-5 |page=309 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wMuF4A4XF8C&amp;pg=PA127 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[McNamara fallacy]] (quantitative fallacy) – making a decision based only on quantitative observations, discounting all other considerations.
* [[Mind projection fallacy]] – subjective judgments are "projected" to be inherent properties of an object, rather than being related to personal perceptions of that object.
* [[Moralistic fallacy]] – inferring factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises in violation of [[fact–value distinction]]. For instance, inferring ''is'' from ''ought'' is an instance of moralistic fallacy. Moralistic fallacy is the inverse of naturalistic fallacy defined below.
* [[Moving the goalposts]] (raising the bar) – argument in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded.
* [[Nirvana fallacy]] (perfect-solution fallacy) – solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect.
* ''[[Philosophic burden of proof|Onus probandi]]'' – from the Latin ''onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat'' the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim, not on the person who denies (or questions the claim). It is a particular case of the ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad ignorantiam}}'' fallacy, here the burden is shifted on the person defending against the assertion. Also known as "[[shifting the burden of proof]]".
* [[Proof by assertion]] – a proposition is repeatedly restated regardless of contradiction; sometimes confused with [[argument from repetition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad infinitum}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad nauseam}}'')
* [[Prosecutor's fallacy]] – a low probability of false matches does not mean a low probability of {{em|some}} false match being found.
* [[Proving too much]] – using a form of argument that, if it were valid, could be used to reach an additional, invalid conclusion.
* [[Psychologist's fallacy]] – an observer presupposes the objectivity of their own perspective when analyzing a behavioral event.
* [[Direct reference theory|Referential fallacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Semiotics Glossary R, [http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~blue/xhx/books/semiotics/glossaryR/section81/main.html ''Referential fallacy or illusion'']&lt;/ref&gt; – assuming all words refer to existing things and that the meaning of words reside within the things they refer to, as opposed to words possibly referring to no real object or that the meaning of words often comes from how they are used.
* [[Reification (fallacy)|Reification]] (concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) – a fallacy of ambiguity, when an abstraction (abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity. In other words, it is the error of treating as a "real thing" something that is not a real thing, but merely an idea.
* [[Retrospective determinism]] – the argument that because an event has occurred under some circumstance, the circumstance must have made its occurrence inevitable.
* [[Special pleading]] – a proponent of a position attempts to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule or principle without justifying the exemption.

=== Improper premise ===
* [[Begging the question]] (''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'') – providing what is essentially the conclusion of the argument as a premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/begging-the-question|title=Your logical fallacy is begging the question|work=Thou shalt not commit logical fallacies|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/begging-the-question.html|title=Fallacy: Begging the Question|work=nizkor.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/61-begging-the-question|title=Begging the Question|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Begging-the-Question.html|title=Begging the Question|work=txstate.edu|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Loaded label – while not inherently fallacious, use of evocative terms to support a conclusion is a type of [[begging the question]] fallacy.  When fallaciously used, the term's connotations are relied on to sway the argument towards a particular conclusion.  For example, an organic foods advertisement that says "Organic foods are safe and healthy foods grown without any pesticides, herbicides, or other unhealthy additives." Use of the term "unhealthy additives" is used as support for the idea that the product is safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John D. Ramage|author2=John C. Bean|author3=June Johnson|title=Writing Arguments: A Rhetoric with Readings, Concise Edition, MLA Update Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-HEjwEACAAJ|year=2016|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-13-458649-6|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Circular reasoning]] (''{{lang|la|circulus in demonstrando}}'') – the reasoner begins with what he or she is trying to end up with; sometimes called ''assuming the conclusion''.
* [[Loaded question|Fallacy of many questions]] (complex question, fallacy of presuppositions, loaded question, ''{{lang|la|plurium interrogationum}}'') – someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved. This fallacy is often used rhetorically so that the question limits direct replies to those that serve the questioner's agenda.

=== Faulty generalizations ===
[[Faulty generalization]] – reach a conclusion from weak premises. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions yet only weakly buttress the conclusions. A faulty generalization is thus produced.
* [[Accident (fallacy)|Accident]] – an exception to a generalization is ignored.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=5}}
** [[No true Scotsman]] – makes a generalization true by changing the generalization to exclude a counterexample.{{sfn|Flew|1984|loc="No-true-Scotsman move"}}
* [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] (suppressed evidence, incomplete evidence) – act of pointing at individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position.{{sfn|Hurley|2007|p=155}}
** [[Survivorship bias]] – a small number of successes of a given process are actively promoted while completely ignoring a large number of failures
* [[False analogy]] – an [[argument by analogy]] in which the analogy is poorly suited.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=151}}
* [[Hasty generalization]] (fallacy of insufficient statistics, fallacy of insufficient sample, fallacy of the lonely fact, hasty induction, ''secundum quid'', converse accident, [[jumping to conclusions]]) – basing a broad conclusion on a small sample or the making of a determination without all of the information required to do so.{{sfn|Hurley|2007|p=134}}
* [[Inductive fallacy]] – A more general name to some fallacies, such as hasty generalization. It happens when a conclusion is made of premises that lightly support it.
* [[Misleading vividness]] – involves describing an occurrence in vivid detail, even if it is an exceptional occurrence, to convince someone that it is a problem; this also relies on the [[appeal to emotion]] fallacy.
* [[Overwhelming exception]] – an accurate generalization that comes with qualifications that eliminate so many cases that what remains is much less impressive than the initial statement might have led one to assume.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=127}}
* [[Thought-terminating cliché]] – a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell [[cognitive dissonance]], conceal lack of forethought, move on to other topics, etc. – but in any case, to end the debate with a cliché rather than a point.

=== Questionable cause ===
[[Questionable cause]] - Is a general type error with many variants.  Its primary basis is the confusion of association with causation.  Either by inappropriately deducing (or rejecting) causation or a broader failure to properly investigate the cause of an observed effect.  
* ''{{lang|la|[[Cum hoc ergo propter hoc]]}}'' (Latin for "with this, therefore because of this"; correlation implies causation; faulty cause/effect, coincidental correlation, correlation without causation) – a faulty assumption that, because there is a correlation between two variables, one caused the other.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=41}}
** ''{{lang|la|[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]}}'' (Latin for "after this, therefore because of this"; temporal sequence implies causation) – X happened, then Y happened; therefore X caused Y.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=180}}
** [[Wrong direction]] (reverse causation) – cause and effect are reversed. The cause is said to be the effect and vice versa.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=135}} The consequence of the phenomenon is claimed to be its root cause.
** [[Ignoring a common cause]]
* [[Fallacy of the single cause]] (causal oversimplification{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=178}}) – it is assumed that there is one, simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes.&lt;!-- Damer describes this in more general terms. --&gt;
* [[Furtive fallacy]] – outcomes are asserted to have been caused by the malfeasance of decision makers.
* [[Gambler's fallacy]] – the incorrect belief that separate, independent events can affect the likelihood of another random event. If a fair coin lands on heads 10 times in a row, the belief that it is "due to the number of times it had previously landed on tails" is incorrect.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=186}}
** [[Inverse gambler's fallacy]]
* [[Magical thinking]] – fallacious attribution of causal relationships between actions and events. In [[anthropology]], it refers primarily to cultural beliefs that ritual, prayer, sacrifice, and taboos will produce specific supernatural consequences. In [[psychology]], it refers to an irrational belief that thoughts by themselves can affect the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it.
* [[Regression fallacy]] – ascribes cause where none exists. The flaw is failing to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of ''post hoc'' fallacy.

=== Relevance fallacies ===
* [[Appeal to the stone]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad lapidem}}'') – dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2709600|title=Johnson's Refutation of Berkeley: Kicking the Stone Again}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Argument from ignorance]] (appeal to ignorance, ''argumentum ad ignorantiam'') – assuming that a claim is true because it has not been or cannot be proven false, or vice versa.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=165}}
* [[Argument from incredulity]] (appeal to common sense) – "I cannot imagine how this could be true; therefore, it must be false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toolkit for Thinking|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/denial-arguments/argument-from-personal-incredulity}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ad nauseam|Argument from repetition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad nauseam}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad infinitum}}'') – repeating an argument until nobody cares to discuss it any more;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/repetition.htm|title=Repetition|work=changingminds.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/inductive-logic-arguments/ad-nauseam|title=Ad nauseam – Toolkit For Thinking|work=toolkitforthinking.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes confused with [[proof by assertion]]
* [[Argument from silence]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ex silentio}}'') – assuming that a claim is true based on the absence of textual or spoken evidence from an authoritative source, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/inductive-logic-arguments/argument-from-silence|title=Argument from silence – Toolkit For Thinking|work=toolkitforthinking.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/55-argument-from-silence|title=Argument from Silence|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Ignoratio elenchi]]'' (irrelevant conclusion, missing the point) – an argument that may in itself be valid, but does not address the issue in question.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=105}}

==== Red herring fallacies ====
A red herring fallacy, one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/redherrf.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Red Herring|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/red-herring/|title=Logical Fallacies|work=logicalfallacies.info|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red herring]] – a speaker attempts to distract an audience by deviating from the topic at hand by introducing a separate argument the speaker believes is easier to speak to.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=208}} Argument given in response to another argument, which is irrelevant and draws attention away from the subject of argument. ''See also [[ignoratio elenchi|irrelevant conclusion]].''
* ''{{lang|la|[[Ad hominem]]}}'' – attacking the arguer instead of the argument.
** ''[[Ad hominem#Circumstantial|Circumstantial ad hominem]]'' - stating that the arguers personal situation or perceived benefit from advancing a conclusion means that their conclusion is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/circumstantial-ad-hominem.html |title=Circumstantial Ad Hominem |author=Nizkor |accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Poisoning the well]] – a subtype of ''{{lang|la|ad hominem}}'' presenting adverse information about a target person with the intention of discrediting everything that the target person says.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=187}}
** [[Abusive fallacy]] – verbally abusing the opponent rather than arguing about the originally proposed argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/10-ad-hominem-abusive|title=Ad Hominem (Abusive)|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to motive]] – dismissing an idea by questioning the motives of its proposer.
** [[Kafka-trapping]] – A sophistical and unfalsifiable form of argument that attempts to overcome an opponent by inducing a sense of guilt and using the opponent's denial of guilt as further evidence of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybell.com/editorials/wendy-mcelroy-beware-of-kafkatrapping/ |title= Beware of Kafkatrapping |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |date=14 August 2014 |website=The Daily Bell |access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Tone policing]] – focusing on emotion behind (or resulting from) a message rather than the message itself as a discrediting tactic.
** [[Ergo decedo|Traitorous critic fallacy]] (''{{lang|la|ergo decedo}}'', 'thus leave') – a critic's perceived affiliation is portrayed as the underlying reason for the criticism and the critic is asked to stay away from the issue altogether.  Easily confused with the [[association fallacy]] ("guilt by association"), below.
* [[Appeal to authority]] (argument from authority, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad verecundiam}}'') – an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it.{{sfn|Clark|Clark|2005|pp=13–16}}{{sfn|Walton|1997|p=28}} The term is also used more broadly to describe arguments that are not always fallacious; {{crossref|printworthy=y|see entry in the [[#Conditional or questionable fallacies|Conditional or questionable fallacies]] section}}.
** [[Appeal to accomplishment]] – an assertion is deemed true or false based on the accomplishments of the proposer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/19-appeal-to-accomplishment|title=Appeal to Accomplishment|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may often also have elements of appeal to emotion (see below).
** [[Courtier's reply]] – a criticism is dismissed by claiming that the critic lacks sufficient knowledge, credentials, or training to credibly comment on the subject matter.
* [[Appeal to consequences]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad consequentiam}}'') – the conclusion is supported by a premise that asserts positive or negative consequences from some course of action in an attempt to distract from the initial discussion.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=27}}
* [[Appeal to emotion]] – an argument is made due to the manipulation of emotions, rather than the use of valid reasoning.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=111}}
** [[Appeal to fear]] – an argument is made by increasing fear and prejudice towards the opposing side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/32-appeal-to-fear|title=Appeal to Fear|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_fear.htm|title=Appeal to Fear|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to flattery]] – an argument is made due to the use of flattery to gather support.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=12}}
** [[Appeal to pity]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad misericordiam}}'') – an argument attempts to induce pity to sway opponents.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=128}}
** [[Appeal to ridicule]] – an argument is made by incorrectly presenting the opponent's argument in a way that makes it appear ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_ridicule.htm|title=Appeal to Ridicule|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/42-appeal-to-ridicule|title=Appeal to Ridicule|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to spite]] – an argument is made through exploiting people's bitterness or spite towards an opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_spite.htm|title=Appeal to Spite|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Judgmental language]] – insulting or pejorative language to influence the audience's judgment.
** [[Pooh-pooh]] – dismissing an argument perceived unworthy of serious consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munson |first1=Ronald |last2=Black |first2=Andrew |date=2016 |title=The Elements of Reasoning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fr4aCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257 |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=257 |isbn=1305886836}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Wishful thinking]] – a decision is made according to what might be pleasing to imagine, rather than according to evidence or reason.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=146}}
* [[Appeal to nature]] – judgment is based solely on whether the subject of judgment is 'natural' or 'unnatural'.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adnature.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Appeal to Nature|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sometimes also called the "naturalistic fallacy", but is not to be confused with the other fallacies by that name.)
* [[Appeal to novelty]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum novitatis}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad antiquitatis}}'') – a proposal is claimed to be superior or better solely because it is new or modern.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=116}}
* [[Appeal to poverty]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad Lazarum}}'') – supporting a conclusion because the arguer is poor (or refuting because the arguer is wealthy). (Opposite of [[appeal to wealth]].){{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=104}}
* [[Appeal to tradition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad antiquitatem}}'') – a conclusion supported solely because it has long been held to be true.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=14}}

* [[Association fallacy]] (guilt by association and honor by association) – arguing that because two things share (or are implied to share) some property, they are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/guiltbya.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Guilt by Association|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* {{lang|la|[[Ipse dixit]]}} (bare assertion fallacy) – a claim that is presented as true without support, as self-evidently true, or as dogmatically true. This fallacy relies on the implied expertise of the speaker or on an unstated truism.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=73tEAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3179 "''Ipse dixit''"], ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia,'' pp. 379–380; Westbrook, Robert B.

The most basic way to distort an issue is to deny that it exists. This fallacy claims, 'That's just how it is.' "&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bulverism]] (psychogenetic fallacy) – inferring why an argument is being used, associating it to some psychological reason, then assuming it is invalid as a result. The assumption that if the origin of an idea comes from a biased mind, then the idea itself must also be a falsehood.&lt;ref name="Fallacious Arguments" /&gt;
* [[Chronological snobbery]] – a thesis is deemed incorrect because it was commonly held when something else, known to be false, was also commonly held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidlavery.net/Barfield/Encyclopedia_Barfieldiana/Lexicon/Chronological.html|title=Encyclopedia Barfieldiana|work=davidlavery.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbergan.com/Summa/Chronological_snobbery |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205021701/http://www.davidbergan.com/Summa/Chronological_snobbery |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{visible anchor|Fallacy of relative privation}} (also known as "appeal to worse problems" or "not as bad as") – dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world, regardless of whether those problems bear relevance to the initial argument. [[First World problem]]s are a subset of this fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZXSDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22first+world%22+%22relative+privation%22|title=All about Them: Grow Your Business by Focusing on Others|first=Bruce|last=Turkel|date=6 September 2016|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Genetic fallacy]] – a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's origin rather than its current meaning or context.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=93}}
* [[Moralistic fallacy]] – inferring factual conclusions from evaluative premises, in violation of [[fact–value distinction]]; e.g. making statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. This is the inverse of the naturalistic fallacy.
* [[Naturalistic fallacy]] – inferring evaluative conclusions from purely factual premises{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Naturalistic "Naturalistic"]}}&lt;ref name="nat-fal"&gt;{{cite web |work=TheFreeDictionary.com |title=Naturalistic fallacy |url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/naturalistic+fallacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in violation of [[fact–value distinction]].  ''Naturalistic fallacy'' in the stricter sense defined in the section "[[#Conditional or questionable fallacies|Conditional or questionable fallacies]]" (below) is a variety of this broader sense. Naturalistic fallacy (sometimes confused with [[appeal to nature]]) is the inverse of [[moralistic fallacy]].
** [[Is–ought problem|Is–ought fallacy]]{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Is-Ought "Is-Ought"]}} – statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. 
* {{sic|hide=y|reason=This is not a typo; the naturalistic fallacy fallacy and the naturalistic fallacy are different.|''Naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy}}&lt;ref&gt;John Searle, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183201 How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is']", ''The Philosophical Review'', '''73''':1 (January 1964), 43–58&lt;/ref&gt; (anti-naturalistic fallacy)&lt;ref&gt;Alex Walter, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150209025135/http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep043348.pdf The Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts]", ''Evolutionary Psychology'', '''4''' (2006), 33–48&lt;/ref&gt; – inferring an impossibility to infer any instance of ''ought'' from ''is'' from the general invalidity of ''is-ought fallacy'', mentioned above. For instance, ''is'' &lt;math&gt;P \lor \neg P&lt;/math&gt; does imply ''ought'' &lt;math&gt;P \lor \neg P&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, although the ''naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy would falsely declare such an inference invalid. ''Naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy is a type of [[argument from fallacy]].
* [[Straw man]] fallacy – an argument based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=22}}
* [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]] – improperly asserting a cause to explain a cluster of data.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/texsharp.html "The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"]}}
* ''[[Tu quoque]]'' ('you too' – appeal to hypocrisy, [[whataboutism]]) – the argument states that a certain position is false or wrong or should be disregarded because its proponent fails to act consistently in accordance with that position.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=164}}
* [[Two wrongs make a right]] – occurs when it is assumed that if one wrong is committed, another wrong will rectify it.{{sfn|Johnson|Blair|1994|p=122}}
* [[Vacuous truth]] – a claim that is technically true but meaningless, in the form of claiming that no ''A'' in ''B'' has ''C'', when there is no ''A'' in ''B''. For example, claiming that no mobile phones in the room are on when there are no mobile phones in the room at all.

* [[Appeal to authority]] (argument from authority, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad verecundiam}}'') – a form of [[Defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] argument in which a claimed authority's support is used as evidence for an argument's conclusion. The argument may actually be cogent when all sides of a discussion agree on the reliability of the authority in the given context. {{crossref|See the [[#Red herring fallacies|Red herring fallacies]] section, above, for the fallacious variant.}}
* [[Broken window fallacy]] – an argument that disregards lost opportunity costs (typically non-obvious, difficult to determine or otherwise hidden) associated with destroying property of others, or other ways of externalizing costs onto others. For example, an argument that states breaking a window generates income for a window fitter, but disregards the fact that the money spent on the new window cannot now be spent on new shoes.
* [[Definist fallacy]] – involves the confusion between two notions by defining one in terms of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Naturalistic Fallacy |first=W. K. |last=Frankena |work=Mind |volume=48 |date=October 1939 |pages=464–77 |publisher=Oxford University Press |jstor=2250706 |issue=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ends justify the means – an assertion that may or may not be defensible depending on the ends and means in question. The various approaches to this sort of question are the subject of the normative ethical theories of [[consequentialism]].
* [[Naturalistic fallacy]] – attempts to prove a claim about ethics by appealing to a definition of the term "good" in terms of either one or more claims about natural properties. The naturalistic fallacy also has a more general version, covered in the [[#Informal fallacies|"Red herring fallacies" section]], above.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles.org" /&gt;
* [[Slippery slope]] (thin edge of the wedge, [[camel's nose]]) – asserting that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact/event that should not happen, thus the first step should not happen. It is, in its essence, an appeal to probability fallacy.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=315}}

'''Male expendability''' is the idea that society can better cope with the loss of a typical man than with the loss of a typical woman.

[[Øystein Gullvåg Holter]] argues that the male-led Russian government's belief in male expendability contributed to their delay in seeking international help during the [[Kursk submarine disaster]], in which an all-male crew was lost. He notes, "If 118 women had been killed, alarm bells regarding discrimination against women would probably have gone off around the world." He notes that able-bodied males were viewed as a more legitimate target during wars in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovan War|Kosovo]], [[Timorese War|Timor]], [[Rwandan War|Rwanda]], and [[Second Chechen War|Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holter |first=Øystein Gullvåg |authorlink=Øystein Gullvåg Holter |title=A theory of gendercide |journal=[[Journal of Genocide Research]] |date=March 2002 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=11–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivana Milojević notes that while patriarchy assigns the role of [[sex object]] to women, it assigns to men the role of violence-object, with male expendability being corollary to the sexual objectification of girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ivana Milojević |title=Why the Creation of a Better World is Premised on Achieving Gender Equity and on Celebrating Multiple Gender Diversities |journal=[[Journal of Futures Studies]] |date=June 2012 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=51–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' or ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' often are about all-male combat teams. Michael D. Clark notes that [[Adolf Hitler]] considered gay men expendable by means of [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[Nazi medical experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=J. Michael |title=From Gay Men's Lives: Toward a More Inclusive, Ecological Vision |journal=[[The Journal of Men's Studies]] |date=May 1993 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=347–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manosphere]] critics of feminism have argued that poor and working-class men "are cannon fodder abroad and expendable labor at home, trapped beneath a glass floor in jobs nobody really wants—farm workers, roofers, garbage men—and injured at far higher rates than women".&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/mens-rights-activism-the-red-pill|author=[[Jeff Sharlet (writer)|Jeff Sharlet]] |date=February 3, 2014 |title=What Kind of Man Joins the Men's Rights Movement? |publisher=GQ |accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Block]] argues in ''The Case for Discrimination'' that male expendability is the result of women's being the bottleneck of reproductive capacity in a population. This theme was echoed in [[Warren Farrell]]'s ''[[The Myth of Male Power]]''.

{{redirect|Narrator}}
'''Narration''' is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the [[author|creator of the story]] presents their story, including:
* '''Narrative point of view'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ezproxy.dacc.edu:4443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.dacc.edu:4048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=98402287&amp;site=eds-live|title=Narration|last=Woltag|first=Laura|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative voice'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: the format through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative time''': the [[grammatical tense|grammatical placement]] of the story's time-frame in the past, the present, or the future.

A ''narrator'' is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered ''participant'' if he/she is a character within the story, and  ''non-participant'' if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.

Narration encompasses not only ''who'' tells the story, but also ''how'' the story is told (for example, by using [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] or [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]]). In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.

== Narrative point of view ==
Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.

=== First-person ===
{{Main article|First-person narrative}}
With the ''first-person'' point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a [[Character (arts)|character]] within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyile|first=Andrea Schwenke|date=1999|title=Expanding the View of First-Person Narration|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=185–202|doi=10.1023/a:1022433202145|issn=0045-6713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of "I" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, "we". Frequently, the narrator is the [[protagonist]], whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the [[focal character]].

=== Second-person ===

The ''second-person'' point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns "you", "your", and "yours." The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare.  Examples include the short fiction of [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Junot Díaz]]. An example in contemporary literature is [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]],'' in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy."—Opening lines of [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|third}}Third-person&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ===
In the ''third-person'' narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as "he", "she", or "they", but never as "I" or "we" (first-person), or "you" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified [[entity]] or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.&lt;ref name="Ricoeur1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ricoeur|title=Time and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjBw9NuSkuEC&amp;pg=PA89|date=15 September 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71334-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied "commentary" or "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the  "he/she" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid.  ''The Narrator'', Iran: Baqney 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with ''third person subjective'' narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and ''third person objective'' narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A ''third person omniscient'' narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a ''third person limited '' narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.

=== Alternating person ===
While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the ''[[Pendragon: Journal of an Adventure through Time and Space|Pendragon]]'' adventure series, by [[D. J. MacHale]], switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Claire E (2004). "[http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/oct04/a-conversation-with-d-j-machale-10041 A Conversation With D.J. MacHale]." ''The Internet Writing Journal''. Writer Write, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Alias Grace]]'' provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]''.

[[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'' is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. [[John Green (author)|John Green]] &amp; [[David Levithan]]'s novel ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[A Long Way Down]]'' has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.

== Narrative voice ==
The narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by "viewing" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.

=== Stream-of-consciousness voice ===
{{Main article|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)}}
A ''stream of consciousness'' gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''. Irish writer [[James Joyce]] exemplifies this style in his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

=== Character voice ===
One of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the ''character voice'', in which a conscious "person" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a ''viewpoint character''. In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the [[storytelling]]. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include [[Doctor Watson]], Scout in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and Nick Carraway of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

==== Unreliable voice ====
{{Main article|Unreliable narrator}}
The unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]," for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jlse.2017.46.issue-1/jls-2017-0005/jls-2017-0005.xml Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield], ''Journal of Literary Semantics,'' Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistolary voice ===
{{Main article|Epistolary novel}}

The ''epistolary narrative voice'' uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]],'' which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons), ''by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story "Passing", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.

=== Third-person voices ===
The third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.

==== {{anchor|omni3}}Third-person, omniscient&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ====
Historically, the ''third-person omniscient'' (or simply ''omniscient'') perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Eliot]]. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Herman |first1=David |last2=Jahn |first2=Manfred |last3=Ryan |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-28259-8 |page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.

In addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic "cast-of-thousands" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==== Third-person, subjective ====
The ''third-person subjective'' is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed ''third-person limited'', in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the [[protagonist]]) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using "he", "she", "it", and "they", but not "I". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'', or Santiago in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as "third person, subjective" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.

This style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the "over the shoulder" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', or [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.

The [[focal character]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.

==== Third-person, objective ====
The ''third-person objective'' employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called ''camera-eye perspective'' is ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This narrative mode is also called the ''third-person dramatic'' because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the ''nouveau roman'' tradition.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

==== Third-person, free/indirect ====
{{main|Free indirect speech}}
The third person indirect style or [[Free indirect speech|free indirect style]] is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.

==== Third-person, alternating ====

Many stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more [[omniscient]] third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series and the books by [[George R. R. Martin]], a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. ''[[The Home and the World]]'', written in 1916 by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series is told in "third person limited" (in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7475-8108-6|location=London|pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative time ==
The ''narrative tense'' or ''narrative time'' determines the [[grammatical tense]] of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in [[present|real time]]. In English, this tense, also known as the "[[historical present]]", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a [[prophecy|prophetic]] tone.

== Other narrative modes ==

=== Fiction-writing mode ===
''Narration'' has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, "true crime", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term ''narration'' refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.

Along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[description]], narration (broadly defined) is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.

Narrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.

The ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing [[Marking scheme|mark schemes]] used for [[National Curriculum assessment]]s in [[England]] reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.

=== Other types and uses ===
In literature, ''person'' is used to describe the viewpoint from which the [[narrative]] is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. ''Third person omniscient'' specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.

In [[film|movies]] and [[video game]]s first- and third-person describe [[virtual camera system|camera viewpoints]]. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, "general" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.

For example, in a [[horror film]], the first-person perspective of an [[antagonist]] could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.

In video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the [[first-person shooter]] genre, such as in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', or in simulations (racing games, flight [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of [[3D computer graphics]] in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' franchise.

Text-based [[interactive fiction]] conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as [[Zork]]. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from [[Spiderweb Software]] which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions.  [[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Halting State]] was written in second person as an allusion to this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-01498-9|title=Halting State, Review|work=Publishers Weekly|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/05/and-another-thing.html|title=And another thing|author=Charles Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narratology''' is the study of [[narrative]] and [[narrative structure]] and the ways that these affect our perception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/modules/introduction.html General Introduction to Narratology], College of Liberal Arts, [[Purdue University]]&lt;/ref&gt; While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is an anglicisation of French ''narratologie'', coined by [[Tzvetan Todorov]] (''Grammaire du Décaméron'', 1969).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Prince]], "Narratology," ''Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', ed. Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994) 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the [[Russian Formalists]], particularly [[Vladimir Propp]] (''Morphology of the Folktale'', 1928), and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theories of [[heteroglossia]], [[dialogism]], and the [[chronotope]] first presented in ''The Dialogic Imagination'' (1975).

==History==
The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the [[Structuralism | structuralist]] quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the [[Formal grammar|grammars]] used as a basis for [[parsing]] [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in some forms of [[linguistics]]. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; [[Percy Lubbock]]'s work in [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]] (''The Craft of Fiction'', 1921) offers a case in point.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1966 a special issue of the journal ''Communications'' proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"/&gt; It included articles by [[Barthes]], Claude Brémond, [[Genette]], [[Greimas]], [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov]] and others, which in turn often referred to the works of [[Vladimir Propp]]&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"&gt;Herman, David and Jahn, Manfred and Ryan, Marie-Laure (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], pp.574–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"&gt;Bamberg, Michael G. W. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HozLdEhiN-8C&amp;pg=PA40 ''Oral Versions of Personal Experience: Three Decades of Narrative Analysis. A Special Issue of the Journal of Narrative and Life History''], p.40{{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1895–1970).

[[Jonathan Culler]] (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between "story," a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and "discourse," the discursive presentation or narration of events.'&lt;ref&gt;
Jonathan Culler, ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'', Routledge Classics ed. (London: Routledge, 2001) 189.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Russian Formalists]] first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet [[fabula and sujet]]. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. ''histoire''/''discours'', ''histoire''/''récit'', ''story''/''plot''. The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ronen, "Paradigm Shift in Plot Models: An Outline of the History of Narratology", ''Poetics Today'', 11(4):817–842 (Winter 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg]], ''Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction'', (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1993.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], 1984, and [[Raphaël Baroni|Baroni]], 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphaël Baroni]], ''La Tension narrative. Suspense, curiosité et surprise'', (Paris: Seuil, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.

[[James Phelan (literary scholar) | James Phelan]], editor of ''Narrative'' (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list). With [[Frederick Luis Aldama]], [[Brian McHale]] and [[Robyn Warhol]], Phelan directs [[Project Narrative]] at [[The Ohio State University]]:)

==Applications==
Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term "narratology" is most typically applied to [[literary theory]] and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[film theory]] and (to a lesser extent) [[film criticism]]. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] studies of oral storytelling ([[William Labov]]) and in [[conversation analysis]] or [[discourse analysis]] that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, [[graphic novels]], the [[infinite canvas]], and narrative sculptures linked to [[topology]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt; Félix Lambert, 2015, "[https://www.academia.edu/11744670/Narrative_sculptures_graph_theory_topology_and_new_perspectives_in_narratology Narrative sculptures: graph theory, topology and new perspectives in narratology]." &lt;/ref&gt;
However, constituent analysis of a type where [[narreme]]s are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of [[linguistics]], [[semiotics]], or [[literary theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann, "[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1975a-theonarreme.pdf Théorie des narrèmes et algorithmes narratifs]," ''Poetics'' 4.1 (1975): 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a [[soccer ball]]. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one [[primary color]]. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Big Olli==
There are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard [[plastic]] [[polyester]] [[statue]] at the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children's Hospital]] and another one has a temporarily place at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]]. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.

==Fictional character biography==
Olli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a [[Japan]]ese [[fantasy]] world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]. Together they are the main cast of a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fr12.nl/dump/9360-olli--amp--giovanni-van-bronckhorst.html
|title=Olli &amp; Giovanni van Bronckhorst|publisher=FR12|language=Dutch|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, [[Netherlands]] of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam [[Zoo]] and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club [[Feyenoord]] and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://christianneblogs.com/2013/03/21/olli-een-aaibare-briljante-reclame

==Background==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] have a history in creating things that help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.nl/2014/03/wereldheerschappij-voor-rotterdamse-olli|title=Wereldheerschappij voor Rotterdamse Olli|publisher=FAB|language=Dutch|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate [[awareness]] and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a [[ZOO]] in [[Rotterdam]].

== copyright infringement ==
In 2015 John Doe BV/Ollimania started a lawsuit against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] insurance company [[ASR Nederland]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=John Doe BV Olli|publisher=IE Forum |date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch [[Insurance]] company used illegally images and foto’s from Ollimania to sell insurances to their customers. The Dutch court ruled in favor of John Doe BV/ Ollimania and urged ASR Nederland to stop their [[copyright infringement]].
[[ASR Nederland]] had a license for a year on one of the Olli toys that expired in August 2014. The insurance company also kept 30.000 toys that were meant for the Rotterdam zoo to earn [[money]] to keep the [[ZOO]] open. [[ASR Nederland]] was entitled to keep the toys and distribute them however they see fit as long they would not infringe the copyrights of John Doe BV and Olli again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=ASR en Olli|publisher=Reclameboek|date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR Nederland is the biggest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.slimmeropweg.nl/het-nieuwe-werken-stappenplan/gerelateerd-nieuws/item/asr-het-nieuwe-generatie-werken|title=Het nieuwe werken|publisher=Slimmer op weg|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; insurance company of the Netherlands with almost 3000 [[employees]].

'''''Ostforschung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔɔstˌfɔʁʃʊŋ|lang}}, "research on the east") is a [[German language|German]] term dating from the 18th century for the study of the areas to the east of [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|the core German-speaking region]].

Traditional ''Ostforschung'' has fallen into disrepute with modern German historians as it often reflected Western European [[Anti-Polish sentiment|prejudices of the time]] towards [[Poles]].&lt;ref name=Karin&gt;{{cite book |first=Karin |last=Friedrich |date=2006 |title=The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=5, 13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpulHjDt8UEC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''Ostforschung'' itself remained in use in the names of some journals and institutes throughout the [[Cold War]], but was replaced by more specific terms by the 1990s (e.g., the journal ''Zeitschrift für Ostforschung'', established in 1952, was renamed ''[[Zeitschrift für Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung]]'' in 1994).

Since the 1990s, ''Ostforschung'' itself has become a subject of historical research.

''Ostforschung'' was also the name of a multidisciplinary organization set up before [[World War II]] by Nazi German chief propagandist [[Albert Brackmann]] supporting Nazi genocidal policies, ethnic cleansing and anti-semitism. Brackmann and several other Nazi and nationalist historians and anthropologists co-ordinated Nazi German research on [[Eastern Europe]], mainly the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The research conducted by this organisation, as well as the [[Ahnenerbe]], was instrumental in planning of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] of local non-German populations in [[Generalplan Ost]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">'''Parallelism''' is a rhetorical device that compounds words or phrases that have equivalent meanings so as to create a definite pattern. This structure is particularly effective when "specifying or enumerating pairs or series of like things".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; A scheme of balance, parallelism represents "one of the basic principles of grammar and rhetoric".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelism as a [[rhetorical device]] is used in many languages and cultures around the world in poetry, epics, songs, written prose and speech, from the folk level to the professional. It is very often found in Biblical poetry and in proverbs in general. 

==Examples==

The following sentences and verses possess "similarity in structure" in words and phrases:

{{quote |''She tried to make the law clear, precise and equitable.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

In the quote above, the compounded adjectives serve as parallel elements and support the noun "law".

{{quote |''Her purpose was to impress the ignorant, to perplex the dubious, and to confound the scrupulous.''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In the above quote, three prepositional phrases produce the parallel structure supporting the noun "purpose". Note that this rhetorical device requires that the coordinate elements agree with one another grammatically: "nouns with nouns, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases and adverb clauses with adverb clauses."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the coordinate elements possess that same number of words (or in the example below, the same number of syllables) the scheme is termed [[Isocolon|isocolon]]:

==Forms of parallelism==
Parallelisms of various sorts are the chief [[rhetoric]]al device of [[Biblical poetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Parallelism}} [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11473a.htm Online version of article].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Tristich]] and in multiples of [[Distich]] parallels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11902-parallelism-in-hebrew-poetry | title=PARALLELISM IN HEBREW POETRY | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Casanowicz, I. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the poetry of many other cultures around the world, particularly in their oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;p. 216. James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Lowth]] coined the term ''parallelismus membrorum'' (parallelism of members, i.e. poetic lines) in his 1788 book, ''Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrew Nation''. [[Roman Jakobson]] pioneered the secular study of parallelism in poetic-linguistic traditions around the world, including his own Russian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, Roman. 1987. "The Poetry of Grammar and the Grammar of Poetry." In Language in Literature. K. Pomorska and S. Rudy, eds. Pp. 121-144. Cambridge, MA: The Belnap Press of Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese and Vietnamese classical poetry and prose have frequently made use of parallelism. Conversations between learned men in many cases involved exchanging single [[:zh:对偶|parallel couplets]] as a form of playing with words, as well as a kind of mental duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann Huss|first1=Ann|last2=Liu|first2=Jianmei|title=The Jin Yong Phenomenon: Chinese Martial Arts Fiction and Modern Chinese Literary History|date=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=9781934043080|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2j5o95IZZAMC&amp;pg=PA223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Tai Thu|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|date=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=9781565180987|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel couplet, not only must the content, the parts of speech, the mythological and historico-geographical allusions, be all separately matched and balanced, but most of the tones must also be paired reciprocally. Even tones are conjoined with inflected ones, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinavista.com/culture/letters/poetry/home.html Chinese Poetic Literature] ChinaVista, 1996-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelisms in artistic speech are common in some languages of Mesoamerica, such as [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec).&lt;ref&gt;William Bright. 1990. "With one lip, with two lips": Parallelism in Nahuatl. ''Language'' 66.3:437-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been observed in a language of Indonesia (that Fox imprecisely referred to as "Rotinese")&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Navajo language|Navajo]].&lt;ref&gt;Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. Anthony K. Webster. 2004. Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal'' 28.4:69-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found parallelisms in the languages of the Ural-Altaic area (including Finnish-Karelian folk poetry and the epics and songs of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples) and [[Toda language|Toda]], suggesting wider distribution among Dravidian languages.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

== In proverbs ==
Parallelisms in [[Proverb|proverbs]] are very common in languages around the world. Parallel structures in short passages such as proverbs help direct the listener or reader to compare the parallel elements and thereby more easily deduce the point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">The '''phantom time hypothesis''' is a historical [[conspiracy theory]] asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III]], [[Pope Sylvester II]], and possibly the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]], to fabricate the [[Anno Domini]] dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Ulrich Niemitz, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf ''Did the Early Middle Ages Really Exist?''] pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.&lt;ref name="fomenko1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly | year = 2007 | publisher = Mithec | isbn = 2-913621-07-4 | title = History: Chronology 1: Second Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this scenario, the entire [[Carolingian period]], including the figure of [[Charlemagne]], is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.

== Heribert Illig ==
Illig was born in 1947 in [[Vohenstrauß]], [[Bavaria]].
He was active in an association dedicated to [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[catastrophism]] and [[historical revisionism]],
''Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte''.
From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal ''Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart''.
Since 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, ''Mantis-Verlag'', and publishing his own journal, ''Zeitensprünge''.
Outside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of [[Egon Friedell]].

Before focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.
His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 ''Das erfundene Mittelalter'' also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Fried: ''Wissenschaft und Phantasie. Das Beispiel der Geschichte'', in: Historische Zeitschrift Band 263,2/1996, 291–316.
Matthias Grässlin, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 1. Oktober 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the journal ''Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften'' offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.&lt;ref&gt;EuS 1997 Heft 4.
Theo Kölzer (Bonn University) refused to contribute, and the journal printed his letter of refusal instead in which Kölzer criticizes the journal for lending credibility to Illig's "abstruse" idea.
A favourable review was published by sociologist Gunnar Heinsohn, which later led to a collaboration between Illig and Heinsohn until 2011, when Heinsohn left the board of editors of Illig's journal and published his rejection of Illig's core idea that the figure of Charlemagne is a high medieval fiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as [[pseudohistory]] in German popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Borgolte]]. In: [[Der Tagesspiegel]] vom 29. Juni 1999. Stephan Matthiesen: ''[http://www.stephan-matthiesen.de/de/texte/archaeologie-geschichte/erfundenes-mittelalter-illig.html Erfundenes Mittelalter – fruchtlose These!]'', in: Skeptiker 2/2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Illig continued to publish on the "phantom time hypothesis" until at least 2013.
Also in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of [[art history]], on [[German Renaissance]] master [[Anton Pilgram]], but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Anton, gen. Pilgram, oder Abschied vom Manierismus'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal ==
The bases of Illig's hypothesis include:&lt;ref name="Illig 1"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Wer hat an der Uhr gedreht? |isbn=3-548-75064-8 | publisher = Econ Verlag | year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illig 2"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Das erfundene Mittelalter |isbn=3-548-36429-2 | publisher = | year =
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scarcity of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence that can be reliably dated to the period AD 614–911, the perceived inadequacies of radiometric and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] methods of dating this period, and the over-reliance of medieval historians on written sources.
* The presence of [[Romanesque architecture]] in tenth-century Western Europe, suggesting the Roman era was not as long ago as conventionally thought.
* The relation between the [[Julian calendar]], [[Gregorian calendar]] and the underlying astronomical [[tropical year|solar or tropical year]]. The Julian calendar, introduced by [[Julius Caesar]], was long known to introduce a discrepancy from the tropical year of around one day for each century that the calendar was in use. By the time the Gregorian calendar was introduced in AD 1582, Illig alleges that the old Julian calendar should have produced a discrepancy of thirteen days between it and the real (or tropical) calendar. Instead, the astronomers and mathematicians working for [[Pope Gregory XIII]] had found that the civil calendar needed to be adjusted by only ten days. (The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582). From this, Illig concludes that the [[Anno Domini|AD]] era had counted roughly three centuries which never existed.

== Criticism ==
* The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in [[Archaeoastronomy|ancient astronomy]], especially those of [[solar eclipse]]s cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to disprove the hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. One is reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] in 59 AD&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder. [http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20II ''Natural History'' (Book II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}, accessed 14 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and one by [[Photius]] in 418 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Photius. [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/philostorgius.htm ''Epitome of the Church History of Philosturgius''], accessed 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these dates and times have confirmed [[Lists of solar eclipses|eclipses]]. In addition, observations during the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, and [[Halley's Comet]], for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no "phantom time" added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Dieter Herrmann|periodical=Beiträge zur Astronomiegeschichte&amp;nbsp;3|title=Nochmals: Gab es eine Phantomzeit in unserer Geschichte? |year=2000|at=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutch|first=Stephen|title=Is a Chunk of History Missing?|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/Phantom%20Time.HTM|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Archaeological remains and dating methods such as [[dendrochronology]] refute, rather than support, "phantom time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Amalie |last=Fößel |title=Karl der Fiktive? |work=[[Damals]], Magazin für Geschichte und Kultur |issue=8 |year=1999 |pages=20f }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325, the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], which had established a method for [[Computus|determining the date]] of [[Easter Sunday]] by fixing the [[vernal equinox]] on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's "three missing centuries" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mütz: ''Die „Phantomzeit“ 614 bis 911 von Heribert Illig. Kalendertechnische und kalenderhistorische Einwände.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für Württembergische Landesgeschichte.'' Band 60, 2001, S. 11–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the [[History of the papacy|Papacy]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The "phantom time" period also encompasses the life of [[Muhammad]] and the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] into the areas of the former Roman Empire, including the conquest of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Iberia]]. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the [[Tang dynasty]] of China and its contact with Islam, such as at the [[Battle of Talas]].&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did the Middle Ages Not Really Happen?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2992/did-the-middle-ages-not-really-happen|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">The best-known '''pleorama''' was a 19th-century moving [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.

Architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]] introduced a pleorama in [[Breslau]] in 1831 with scenes of the [[Bay of Naples]] on both sides of 24 "voyagers" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, [[Vesuvius]] erupting. Writer/artist [[August Kopisch]] was involved in designing the hour-long show.

Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a [[diorama]] exhibit in [[Berlin]], took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river [[Rhine]]. 

The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious [[mareorama]] at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition]].

A similar idea was used for a [[London]] ''padorama'' in 1834. Spectators were seated in [[railway]] carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

In 1850s [[Finland]] the name ''pleorama'' was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibbild.abo.fi/nojen/ Posters in Swedish for pleoramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''pleorama'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in ''-orama'' - [[diorama]] and [[cyclorama]], for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The ''pleo-'' part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. ''Pleorama'' is also the 21st century name of an innovative "floating house".

[[File:Helianthus annuus pollen 1.jpg|thumb|right|Helianthus annuus pollen]]
'''Pollen zones''' are a system of subdividing the [[last glacial period]] and [[Holocene]] paleoclimate using the data from [[pollen core]]s. The sequence provides a global chronological structure to a wide variety of researchers, such as [[geology|geologists]], [[climatology|climatologisist]]s, [[geography|geographers]] and [[archaeologist]]s, who study the physical and cultural environment of the last 15,000 years.

==History==
The palynological aspects of the system were first investigated extensively by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[palynology|palynologist]] [[Lennart von Post]] in the years before the [[World War I|First World War]]. By analysing pollen  in [[core sample]]s taken from [[peat]] bogs, von Post noticed that different plant species were represented in bands through the cores.

The differing species and differing quantities of the same species are caused by changes in climate. Von Post was able to confirm the [[Blytt-Sernander]] climatic sequence showing fluctuations between warmer and colder periods across thousands of years. He used local peat sequences combined with [[varve]] dating to produce a regional climatic chronology for [[Scandinavia]].

In 1940 [[Harry Godwin]] began applying von Post's methods to pollen cores from the [[British Isles]] to produce the wider European sequence accepted today. It basically expanded the Blytt-Sernander further into the late [[Pleistocene]] and refined some of its periods. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], the technique spread to the Americas.

Currently scientists are focusing a repertory of several different methods on [[core sample]]s in peat, ice, lake and ocean bottoms, and sediments to achieve "high resolution" dating not possible to only one method: [[Carbon dating]], [[Dendrochronology]], [[Oxygen isotope ratio cycle|isotope ratios]] on a number of gases, studies of insects and molluscs, and others. While often doubting the utility of the modified Bytt-Sernander, they seem to confirm and expand it all the more.

==Notes on the sequence table==
At present nine main pollen zones, I-IX, are defined, based on the work of [[Johannes Iversen|J. Iversen]], published in 1954. These are matched to period names called "biostratigraphic divisions" in the table, which were defined for Denmark by Iverson based on layers in the peat bogs. They represent climatic and biological zones in the peat. 

Others have used these names in different senses, such as the 1974 chronozones of J. Mangerud. The sequences in Germany and Sweden are not exactly the same as those in Denmark, inviting scientists there to use the names still differently or make other definitions. Moreover, the names are apt to be used interchangeably for glacials, interglacials, stadial, interstadials, or oscillations, leading some scientists to deplore the lack of system.

The system of the table below covers from around 13,000 BC to the modern day. Dates, given in years BC, are best viewed as being based on uncalibrated C-14 dates, which, when calibrated, would result in much earlier BC dates. For example, an Older Dryas start date of 10,000 BC translates roughly into an uncalibrated BP date of 12,000. Calibrated, that becomes 14,000 BP, 12,000 BC. To obtain quick, on-line calibrations, you may use [http://www.calpal-online.de/index.html CalPal].

The dates in the table correspond relatively well to more modern dates for the earlier periods. Larger discrepancies begin at the end of the Boreal. More, and more modern, details on the dating of the periods are given under the article for each one.

The archaeological periods listed only apply to north Europe, and do so approximately. For example, there is no uniform chronozone, "the Bronze Age", which would apply globally or even be of the same dates between north and south Europe.

The geological stages listed are only defined for the British Isles. Scientists use different names for north Europe, south Europe and other regions. However, they are cross-correlated in the articles for the ones listed.

In contrast to glacial periods, these pollen zones are being used to apply globally, with but few exceptions. It is acceptable, for example, to refer to the "Younger Dryas" of [[Antarctica]], which has no pollen of its own. A few scientists disapprove of such uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8392">The '''priming''' theory states that [[Multimedia|media]] images [[association (psychology)|stimulate related thoughts]] in the minds of audience members.&lt;ref name="SLD"&gt;Straubhaar, LaRose, Davenport.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grounded in [[cognitive psychology]], the theory of media priming is derived from the associative network model of human memory, in which an idea or concept is stored as a node in the network and is related to other ideas or concepts by semantic paths.  Priming refers to the activation of a node in this network, which may serve as a filter, an interpretive frame, or a premise for further information processing or judgment formation.&lt;ref&gt;Pan, Z. &amp; Kosicki, G.M. (1997). Priming and Media Impact on the Evaluations of the President's Performance. Communication Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General aggression model==
The '''general aggression model''' ('''GAM''') integrates the priming theory with the [[social learning theory]] to describe how previously learned violent behavior may be triggered by thoughts, emotions, or physiological states provoked by media exposure.&lt;ref name=SLD/&gt;  However, the GAM has come under considerable criticism in recent years regarding underlying and unproven assumptions and poor data support for the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson &amp; Dyck|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|year=2012|volume=17|pages=220–228|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.02.007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103208/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political media priming==
[[Political media]] priming is "the process in which the media attend to some issues and not others and thereby alter the standards by which people evaluate election candidates".&lt;ref&gt;Severin &amp; Tankard, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have demonstrated that there is a dimension of powerful media effects that goes beyond agenda setting. In 1982, Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder first identified this added dimension as the “[[Priming (psychology)|priming effect]].”&lt;ref name="Iyengar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder|title=Experimental Demonstrations of the "Not-So-Minimal" Consequences of Television News Programs|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1982|volume=76|issue=4|pages=848–858|doi=10.2307/1962976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is founded on the assumption that people do not have elaborate knowledge about political matters and do not take into account all of what they do know when making political decisions — they must consider what more readily comes to mind. Through drawing attention to some aspects of politics at the expense of others, the media might help to set the terms by which political judgments are reached, including evaluations of political figures.&lt;ref&gt;Alger, D.E.  (1989).  The Media and Politics.  New Jersey:  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that priming is often discussed in tandem with [[agenda-setting theory]]. The reason for this association is two-fold. The first, per Hastie &amp; Park, is that both theories revolve around salient information recall, operating on the idea that people will use information that is most readily available when making decisions. The second, per Iyengar and Kinder, is that priming is latter part of a two-fold process with agenda-setting that takes place over time. Once agenda setting has made an issue salient, priming is the process by which "mass media can... shape the considerations that people take into account when making judgements about political candidates or issues". In short, both theories point to ease of accessibility of information in one's mind but priming is something that can occur over a period of time after exposure to a given media segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scheufele &amp; Tewksbury|title=Framing, Agenda Setting, and Priming: The Evolution of Three Media Effects Models|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2007|volume=57|pages=9–20|doi=10.1111/j.0021-9916.2007.00326.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Priming isn’t always unintentional, as Jacobs and Shapiro demonstrate in a quantitative and historical analysis of [[John F. Kennedy]]’s [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential campaign]]. Their research extends the application of priming theory from its original focus of how individuals form attitudes and make decisions to the study of candidate behavior. This new approach, they say, "changes the analytic focus from unintentional priming to intentional priming, namely, the deliberate strategies that candidates pursue to influence voters". Priming can be an effective [[political campaign|campaign]] strategy for presidential candidates, the authors indicate, by a process of carefully calculated uses of [[public opinion]] on policy issues to influence voters’ standards for assessing the candidates’ attributes. In this study, the authors focus on the 1960 election because innovative public opinion surveys were incorporated into Kennedy’s campaign strategy that enabled him to use position taking to shape his image. Their research was based on primary evidence drawn from archival records and interviews, as well as a combination of interpretative and quantitative analysis. They found that a relationship exists between Kennedy’s positions on policy matters and results from his private public opinion surveys. His campaign combined image building with position taking on issues that responded to perceived public opinion. Though this study does neglect questions concerning how and why real politicians use polling results to prime voters, Jacobs and Shapiro effectively demonstrate that the priming process is powerful enough to be used intentionally by political candidates as a tool to influence public opinion during election campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs and Shapiro (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 study of priming, they set out to determine what effect intentional priming might have on the public's evaluation of president [[Jimmy Carter]]. Their hypothesis stated that making certain political topics salient through primetime media, such as defense or spending, would cause viewers to evaluate president Carter based on said topics. The experiment's results demonstrated the phenomena of agenda-setting and priming. First, Iyengar et al. found evidence of agenda-setting in the positive correlation between exposure to a given political topic and its importance when evaluating the president. They then found that said standards affected the actual evaluation of the president's performance, demonstrating priming. This experiment points to the potential of news media to direct the public's attention and perception of political figures, though the researchers also indicate that subjects with higher self-reported levels of knowledge of politics showed decreased effects of priming. This lead Iyengar's team to the conclusion that priming has varied implications depending on an individual's given knowledge prior to political news media exposure.&lt;ref name="Iyengar"/&gt;

In art and archaeology, in sculpture as well as in painting, a '''register''' is a horizontal level in a work that consists of several levels arranged one above the other, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines.  Modern [[comic books]] typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. In the study of ancient writing, such as [[cuneiform]] and Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s, "register" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in [[cylinder seal]]s, which often mix text and images.  Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically.  

Among many other cultures, the use of registers is common in [[Ancient Egyptian art]], from the [[Narmer Palette]] onwards, and in [[medieval art]] in large [[fresco]]s and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  [[Narrative art]], especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers.  

Sculpted [[Luwian language hieroglyphs]] were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T., ''The World's Writing Systems'', pp. 120-121, 1996, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195079930}}, 9780195079937, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ospMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples, in the [[art of Mesopotamia]], are [[Kudurru]], or boundary stones, which often had registers of [[god]]s on the upper registers of the scenes.

'''Secular arm''', in [[ecclesiastical law]], refers to the legal authority of the civil power, the State, or any [[Laity|lay]] authority, invoked by the Church to punish offenders in cases properly belonging to the jurisdiction of the Church. In the [[Middle Ages]] especially in Inquisition trials for [[heresy]], or grave immorality, ecclesiastical courts delivered convicted clerical and lay offenders over to the secular arm to administer severe capital punishments. The phrase "[[Spanish Inquisition#Sentencing|relaxed]] to the secular arm" was used by the [[Spanish Inquistion]] to describe the handover of the condemned heretic.

The medieval Latin phrase 'brachium seculare' was translated first into late Middle English.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Religion&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Introduced circa 1180–1250 at the time of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the church inquisitors delivered a [[Cathar]] heretic, or any heretic, to the secular arm, to be burnt at the stake. 
Under [[canon law]] church tribunals had no jurisdiction to impose penalties involving mutilation or death.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages p.260&lt;/ref&gt;
Notably the contrary circumstance of appeal by individuals to the secular authorities to interfere with, or hinder, the process of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was until recently punished in the [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]] [[Catholic Church|Church]] by [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (3 ed.)p.532&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''Sexual violence by intimate partners''' deals with the incidence by country of [[physical abuse]], forced sex, or [[marital rape]] within the context of domestic violence. 

==Domestic violence and sexual abuse==
Domestic [[sexual violence]], such as forced sex or marital rape, may follow or be part of physical abuse, but is not always the case. In [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], studies estimate that 40–52% of women experiencing physical violence by an intimate partner have also been sexually coerced by that partner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell JC, Soeken KL. Forced sex and intimate partner violence: effects on women’s risk and women’s health. Violence Against Women, 1999, 5:1017–1035.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granados Shiroma M.Salud reproductiva y violencia contra la mujer: un ana lisis desde la perspectiva de género. [Reproductive health and violence against women: an analysis from the gender perspective of Nuevo Leon, Asociación Mexicana de Población, Colegio de México, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sexual violence may occur without physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hakimi M et al. Silence for the sake of harmony: domestic violence and women’s health in central Java. Yogyakarta, Gadjah Mada University, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in a representative sample of over 6000 men, 7% reported having sexually and physically abused their wives, 22% reported using sexual violence without physical violence and 17% reported that they had used physical violence alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin SL et al. Sexual behaviour and reproductive health outcomes: associations with wife abuse in India. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1999, 282:1967–1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence by country==
Studies indicate that sexual assault by an intimate partner is neither rare nor unique to any particular region of the world. For instance, 23% of women in North [[London]], [[England]], reported having been the victim of either an attempted or completed rape by a partner in their lifetime. Similar figures have been reported for [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (23.0%), [[León, Nicaragua]], (21.7%), [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (22.5%), and for the [[Midlands Province]] in [[Zimbabwe]] (25.0%). The prevalence of women sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetime (including attempted assaults) has also been estimated in a few national surveys (for example, [[Canada]] 8.0%, [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] (combined) 14.2%, [[Finland]] 5.9%, [[Switzerland]] 11.6% and the [[United States]] 7.7%).

The table below summarizes some available data on the prevalence of sexual coercion by intimate partners.

[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Adriaen van Ostade]]. ''Selfportrait.'' 1663. [[Gemäldegalerie]].]]

A '''studio''' is an [[artist]] or worker's workroom. This can be for the purpose of [[acting]], [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[pottery]] ([[ceramic]]s), [[sculpture]], [[origami]], [[woodworking]], [[scrapbooking]], [[photography]], [[graphic design]], [[filmmaking]], [[animation]], [[industrial design]], [[radio]] or [[television production]] [[broadcasting]] or the making of [[music]]. The term is also used for the workroom of [[dancer]]s, often specified to [[dance studio]].

The word ''studio'' is derived from the {{Lang-it|studio}}, from {{Lang-lat|studium}}, from ''studere'', meaning to [[Wiktionary:study|study]] or zeal.

The French term for studio, '''[[atelier]]''', in addition to designating an artist's studio is used to characterize the studio of a fashion designer. Atelier also has the connotation of being the home of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] or [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]].

''Studio'' is also a metonym for the group of people who work within a particular studio. 

==Art studio==
[[File:Jane Frank Portrait .jpg|thumb|Artist [[Jane Frank]] in her studio, 1960s or 1970s. The studio of a contemporary [[mixed media]] artist can be quite a messy affair.]]

The studio of any artist, especially from the 15th to the 19th centuries, characterized all the assistants, thus the designation of paintings as "from the [[workshop]] of..." or "studio of..."
An art studio is sometimes called an '''atelier''', especially in earlier eras. In contemporary, English language use, "atelier" can also refer to the [[Atelier Method]], a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist's studio. 

The above-mentioned "method" calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space. A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline. Academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression. A versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment, which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist's expression. Thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop.

Safety is or may be a concern in studios, with some painting materials required to be handled, stored, or used properly to prevent poisoning, chemical burns, or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Friel, Michael (2010). ''Still Life Painting Atelier: An Introduction to Oil Painting'', p.20. {{ISBN|978-0-8230-3408-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Commons-inline|bullet=none|Category:Ateliers|atelier}}

==Educational studio==
In educational studios, students learn to develop skills related to design, ranging from architecture to product design.  In specific, educational studios are studio settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college.  Educational studios are colloquially referred to as "studio" by students, who are known for staying up late hours into the night doing projects and socializing.

The studio environment is characterized by 2 types in education:
# The workspace where students do usually visually-centered work in an open environment. This time and space is beyond that of instructional time and faculty guidance is not available. It allows for students to engage each other, help each other, and inspire each other while working.
# A type of class that takes the above-mentioned workshop space, and recreates its core component of an open working environment. It differentiates itself based on a topic of instruction, isolated space, instructor led/included, and an added focus of directed criticism. A great take on this latter type of "studio classroom" is [http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html described by Carleton University].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is studio teaching?|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery studio==
[[Pottery|Studio pottery]] is made by an individual potter working on his own in his studio, rather than in a ceramics factory (although there may be a design studio within a larger manufacturing site).

==Production studios==
Production studios are those studios which act as centres for the production in any of the [[arts]]; alternatively they can also be the financial and commercial entity behind such endeavours. In radio and [[television production]] studio is the place where programs and [[radio commercial]] and [[television advertising]] are recorded for further emission.

===Animation studio===
[[Animation studio]]s, like [[movie studio]]s, may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in [[anime]], they continue the tradition of a studio where a [[Master tradesman|master]] or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision. Animation studios are a fast rising entity and they include established firms such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] and [[Pixar]].

===Comics studio===
Artists or writers, predominantly those producing [[comics]], still employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a [[comic strip]], [[comic book]] or [[graphic novel]].  In the early days of [[Dan Dare]], [[Frank Hampson]] employed a number of staff at his studio to help with the production of the strip.  [[Eddie Campbell]] is another creator who has assembled a small studio of colleagues to help him in his art, and the comic book industry of the United States has based its production methods upon the studio system employed at its beginnings.

==Instructional studio==
[[File:Student using Laptop.jpg|thumbnail|right|Student using a laptop in an instructional studio.]]
Many [[University|universities]] are creating studio settings for courses outside the artist's realm. There are several different projects along these lines, most notably the [[SCALE-UP]] (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) initiated at [[NC State]].

===Mastering studio===
In audio, a mastering studio is a facility specialised in [[audio mastering]]. Tasks may include but not be limited to audio restoration, corrective and tone-shaping EQ, dynamic control, stereo or 5.1 surround editing, vinyl and tape transfers, vinyl cutting, and CD compilation. Depending on the quality of the original mix, the mastering engineer's role can change from small corrections to improving the overall sound of a mix drastically. Typically studios contain a combination of high-end analogue equipment with low-noise circuitry and digital hardware and plug-ins. Some may contain tape machines and vinyl lathes. They may also contain full-range monitoring systems and be acoustically tuned to provide an accurate reproduction of the sound information contained in the original medium. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be radio, CD, vinyl or digital distribution.

In [[video production]], a mastering studio is a facility specialized in the [[post-production]] of video recordings. Tasks may include but not be limited to: [[video editing]], [[colour grading]] correction, mixing, [[DVD authoring]] and [[audio mastering]]. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be broadcast, DVD or digital distribution.

===Acting studio===

An "acting studio" is an institution or workspace (similar to a dance studio) in which actors rehearse and refine their craft. The [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] and [[Actors Studio]] are legendary acting studios in New York.

===Movie studio===
{{Main|Movie studio}}

A '''movie studio''' is a [[company (law)|company]] which develops, equips and maintains a controlled environment for [[filmmaking]].  This environment may be interior ([[sound stage]]), exterior ([[backlot]]) or both.

===Photographic studio===
{{Main|Photographic studio}}

A photographic studio is both a workspace and a [[corporation|corporate]] body. As a workspace it provides space to take, develop, print and duplicate photographs.

===Radio studio===
{{Main|Radio studio}}

A radio studio is a room in which a [[Radio programming|radio program]] or show is produced, either for live [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] or for recording for a later broadcast.  The room is soundproofed to avoid unwanted noise being mixed into the broadcast.

===Recording studio===
{{Main|Recording studio}}

A recording studio is a facility for [[sound recording]] which generally consists of at least two rooms: the studio or live room, and the control room, where the sound from the studio is recorded and manipulated. They are designed so that they have good [[acoustics]] and so that there is good isolation between the rooms.

===Television studio===
{{Main|Television studio}}

A television studio is an installation in which television or [[video production]]s take place, for [[live television]], for recording [[video tape]], or for the acquisition of raw [[footage]] for [[post-production]]. The design of a studio is similar to, and derived from, [[movie studio]]s, with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production. A professional television studio generally has several rooms, which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons.

==Yoga and martial arts studios==
Many of the healing arts and activities such as yoga, judo, karate are "studied" in a studio.  It is very common to see yoga studios and martial arts studios established in settings that might previously have been for other uses, described as studios.  These are not really recreation centers, or gyms in the traditional sense, but places where students of these activities practice or study their art.

The '''Vienna School of Art History''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Schule der Kunstgeschichte}}) was the development of fundamental [[art history|art-historical]] methods at the [[University of Vienna]]. This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity.

A characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a "scientific" ("wissenschaftlich") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School  combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments.

The concept of a Viennese "school" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kramář in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by [[Otto Benesch]] in 1920 and by [[Julius von Schlosser]] in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.

== History ==

===Pragmatic art history===

[[Rudolf Eitelberger]] is considered to have been the "forefather" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the [[Vormärz]], and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture.

The first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was [[Moritz Thausing]], who in 1879 became the second ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from [[aesthetics]].

===Formalist art history===

Thausing's students [[Franz Wickhoff]] (Professor 1891) and [[Alois Riegl]] (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of [[late antiquity]], which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of [[positivism]], focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation.

===Idealist art history===

After the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art-historical positions at the University was filled by [[Max Dvořák]], who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvořák's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvořák, in part influenced by the contemporary [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of [[Mannerism]]. Dvořák's idealistic method, which would later be termed "''Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte''" ("art history as intellectual history"), found its most committed champions in [[Hans Tietze]] and [[Otto Benesch]].

===Structuralist art history===

Dvořák also died young, and in 1922 [[Julius von Schlosser]] was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher [[Benedetto Croce]] and of [[Karl Vossler]], a Munich-based professor of the [[Romance languages]], under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the "''Stilgeschichte''" ("style-history") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the "''Sprachgeschichte''" ("language-history") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides [[Ernst Gombrich]], were [[Hans Sedlmayr]] and [[Otto Pächt]], who in the 1930s founded art-historical "structuralism." Their methodology was described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as the "New Vienna School"; it has also been described as the "Second Vienna School."

===Ideological art history===

[[Josef Strzygowski]], who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvořák, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original "Nordic" character, which was superior to the "Mediterranean." As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the "orthodox" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the "arch-humanist" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the "Attila of art history." The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of "''Planforschung''," which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely "Nordic," was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School.

===Synthesis===

The era of [[Nazism]] signified a turning point for the Vienna School.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Aurenhammer, "Zäsur oder Kontinuität? Das Wiener Kunsthistorische Institut im Ständestaat und im Nationalsozialismus." In ''Wiener Schule. Erinnerung und Perspektiven'' (''Wiener Jahrbuch für Kunstgeschichte'', 53). Vienna, Cologne and Weimar 2004, pp. 11-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methdological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. [[Hans Sedlmayr]], a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, [[Karl Maria Swoboda]] assumed leadership of the ''Insitut'', where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two ''Ordinarius'' positions were once more created, and were filled by [[Otto Pächt]] (a student of Schlosser) and [[Otto Demus]] (a student of Strzygowski). Under the "two Ottos" Vienna became a "''Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte''" ("a mecca for medieval art history"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of [[Fritz Novotny]]. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.

'''Yde Girl''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ɪ|d|ə|audio=Yde IPA.ogg}}) is a [[bog body]] found in the ''Stijfveen'' [[peat]] bog near the village of [[Yde]], [[Netherlands]]. She was found on 12 May 1897 and was reputedly uncannily well-preserved when discovered (especially her [[hair]]), but by the time the body was turned over to the authorities a [[fortnight]] later it had been severely damaged and deteriorated.&lt;ref name=deem&gt;{{cite web|last=Deem|first=James M.|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|title=Drents Museum in Assen, the Netherlands: The Yde Girl|accessdate=16 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152742/http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her teeth had been pulled from the skull by villagers as well as a large amount of hair.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt; The peat cutting tools had also been reported to have severely damaged the body.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

[[Carbon-14]] tests have indicated that Yde Girl died between 54 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 128 CE at an approximate age of 16 years.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; She had long reddish blond hair, but one side of her head was initially thought to have been shaved before she died. Recent studies of [[Windeby I]], however, have suggested that the shaved hair phenomenon in some bog bodies may simply attest to one side of the head being exposed to oxygen slightly longer than the other. Scans have shown that she suffered from [[scoliosis]]. She stood at {{convert|137|cm|ftin}}, which is comparatively small for a sixteen-year-old.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

The body was found clad in a woolen cape and with a woolen band, made in a braiding technique known as [[sprang]], wrapped around the neck, suggesting she was executed or sacrificed.&lt;ref name=city&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper|title=BEST MUSEUM EXHIBIT: THE MYSTERIOUS BOG PEOPLE|date=7 December 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dan&gt;{{cite news|last=Nephin|first=Dan|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=AP Online|title=Mummy Exhibit Shows Off Interactive Side|date=6 July 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a stab wound in the area of her collarbone, but that was not determined as the cause of death. It is thought that she may have died while unconscious, as defensive wounds were absent on the hand that was recovered from the body, unlike a similar case in Germany, the [[Kayhausen Boy]], who had a cut on his left hand from an apparent defense attempt.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; As with most bog bodies, the skin and features are still preserved because of the [[tannic acid]] in the marsh water. When Yde Girl was excavated, the diggers accidentally caused a wound to the skull. Only the torso of the girl, the head, the right hand and the feet remain intact today. The rest of her body was not preserved or had been damaged by peat cutting tools.

The Yde Girl was put on display and further study was not carried out on the remains until 1992. [[Richard Neave]], of University of Manchester, took a [[CT scan]] of the skull of Yde Girl and determined her age, both anatomically and historically.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohd Isa|first=Marisa|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82747279.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=News Straits Times|title=Unveiling mummy secrets|date=6 January 2006}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yde Girl became internationally known when Neave made a reconstruction of her head, using techniques from [[plastic surgery]] and criminal [[pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Prag | first1 = John | last2 = Neave | first2 = Richard | title = Making faces: using forensic and archaeological evidence |trans-title=Bodies from the Bog | year = 1997 | publisher = British Museum | location = London | language = | isbn = 0-7141-1743-9 | pages = 157–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the state of the body, the work on the reconstruction included some guesswork, for example, the nose.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the [[Drents Museum]] in [[Assen]].

Yde Girl, along with [[Roter Franz]] and the [[Weerdinge Men]], were transported across the world for a museum tour in both the early and mid 2000s.&lt;ref name=visit&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Sue Ellen|title=Visit the mummies before they leave for L.A.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-71012131.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Sunday Gazette-Mail|date=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref name=dan/&gt; Due to the intensity of the girl's death, protests in [[Canada]] prevented the tour from traveling through several locations in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CULTURE-CANADA: 'BOG PEOPLE' MUMMIES PROVOKE PROTESTS|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Inter Press Service English News Wire|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2003/01/arts-weekly-culture-canada-bog-people-display-provokes-protest/|first=Mark|last=Bourrie|date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
