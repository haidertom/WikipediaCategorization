'''AKTIP – Konzultační a terapeutický institut Praha''' (The Consultation and Therapeutic Institute Prague) is a private institute run by the public business company Progressive consulting, offering services in the field of psychosomatic care.&lt;ref name="group" /&gt; The head of the institute is psychiatrist Jarmila Klímová.&lt;ref name="kontakty" /&gt;

Controversy about the methods of the institute emerges&lt;ref name="news" /&gt; when the documentary Infiltrace: Obchod se zdravím (Infiltration: Health Business) was broadcast by Czech television on May 21, 2018.
The documentary revealed that the company uses unethical techniques to the detriment of its patients for its financial gain, including [[pseudoscience]], manipulation, and incitement of fear of cancer and anxiety. AKTIP offers examinations and healing by instrumentation&lt;ref name="ans" /&gt; and [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] preparations of doubtful effectiveness for various somatic diseases, including [[thyroid disease]].&lt;ref name="CT" /&gt;
Although it has physicians on staff, this institution is not a legitimate provider of health services. It is not a medical facility.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt;

== Erratic Boulder award in the category of teams 2016 ==
AKTIP is the holder of the Silver Erratic Boulder award in the category of teams for 2016.
''“An eventual client meets here imaginary care in a wide range of disciplines. His complex problems will be treated by a [[graphology|graphologist]], an expert in oriental diagnostics and bioresonance therapy will also supply its part of information. If it fails, a miraculous ANESA device, known as the non-invasive AMP blood analyzer (Golden Erratic Boulder award for 2011), will come to the scene”'', said [[Český klub skeptiků Sisyfos|Sisyfos]].&lt;ref name="sisyfos" /&gt;

In the awards report its representatives also cite the statement of the head of AKTIP Jarmila Klímová that the human body is set for 400 years of life. ''“If we really lived only by biological hours, we could be at rest between 380 and 460 years, because this age is set up for our body ... And why do we live only 60 or 80 years? No, because the most important influence outside of ourselves, which fundamentally affects the length and quality of life, we do not accept.”''&lt;ref name="e15" /&gt;

== Professional public response ==
The practices of AKTIP was already criticized by the Czech Oncological Society in 2014.&lt;ref name="otazky" /&gt;
Procedures used by AKTIP employees have been critically evaluated by doctors&lt;ref name="CT" /&gt; (f.ex. by cardiologist Věra Adámková) The psychologist Petr Weiss described AKTIP's practices as charlatan fabrications, fraud, and money-pulling activities.&lt;ref name="rozhlas" /&gt;

According to the President of the Czech Medical Chamber Milan Kubka, AKTIP's position in the future could be solved by a law on healers that would force "all such charlatan institutions" to mandatory registration. ''“This institution only looks like a medical facility, and that's a scam from my point of view.”''&lt;ref name="lidovky" /&gt;

[[Český klub skeptiků Sisyfos|Sisyfos]], in response to the AKTIP case, has published an article analyzing the principles of some devices used by individual "consultants" of AKTIP. This article also expresses concern that AKTIP is not an exceptional case, but that it is a fairly common phenomenon among institutions that provide services of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="sramek" /&gt;

Called Medical Laboratory Scientist or Bachelor of science in the United States depending on their training, bacteriologists to homologate their title in the United States are called Bachelor of Bacteriology.

== Aims ==
The main aim of a bacteriologist is prognosticate, diagnose and the [[disease surveillance]] by a huge range of laboratory test, all of them in the context of health care. Hence, a bacteriologist plays a role in research, management of the [[health care]], promoting health and [[disease prevention]].

There are plenty of methods and procedures used by the bacteriologist in the clinical laboratory whose purpose is the diagnosis of various diseases, some of these techniques are:

'''Techniques in Clinical Chemistry:''' used for determination of various analyses in various biological fluids, different reagents are used to play colorimetric techniques and enzyme kinetics, among others. The result of these reactions were measured by spectrometer or other similar physical techniques to quantitatively determine the value of an analyte, so as measured quantitatively analytes such as creation, BUN, lipid profile, total protein, glucose, direct bilirubin and overall, among others.

'''Techniques in Immunology:''' many of the immunological techniques used in clinical laboratory are based on the ability of antibodies to bind to specific antigens either in vitro or vivo, is how this feature that is exploited by the professional laboratory diagnose various diseases and / or semi-quantitative or quantitative determination of various analytes, among the various techniques used in immunology section include: immunology Test as ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunodeficient assay) for its acronym in English, with agglutination techniques latex particles coated with antibody or antigen, agglutination techniques, articulation chromatography techniques, microorganisms stereotyping techniques, fluorescence, among many others. Some of the tests performed in this section mentioned techniques are: rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies by agglutination with latex particles, c-reactive protein, chromatography for determination of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus, ELISA for determination of hormones and the presence of other microorganisms causing diseases among other tests.

'''Techniques in Microbiology:''' mainly used to determine infectious diseases the causative agent of the disease, regardless of whether it is caused by a bacterium, virus, fungi or parasites, bacteriologist through various coloration's, microscopic observation, specific crops for growth of each organism, biochemical tests whether manual, semi-automated or automated used to determine the genus and species of the organism causing the disease. a bacteriologist should be able to identify and name any parasitic observe microscopic structure, recently antimicrobial susceptibility tests have become very important for the emergence of multi-resistant bacterial strains in clinical microbiology section of the laboratory tests performed bacteriologists antimicrobial susceptibility to determine which antibiotics should treat various infectious diseases.

'''Techniques in Hematology:''' Section of Hematology various examinations are performed as: Table He mic, FSP (peripheral blood smear), reticulated count, observation and identification of parasites, determining blood type and RH, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, among other . Bacteriologists in specialized clinical laboratory hematology specialists perform more specific tests for diagnosis of hematologic diseases such as leukemia, anemia, regardless of etiology or other genetic alterations by various techniques such wherein phenotype cell markers studies performed by flow optometry, molecular biology techniques molecular as electroscopes, PCR and other tests such as: osmotic fragility, analysis of bone marrow aspirates, among others.

'''Techniques in Molecular Biology and Genetics:''' in specialized clinical laboratory services are included with molecular biology and genetics where the bacteriologist makes techniques such as chain reaction (PCR), electroscopes, Southern blot, Western blot, and DNA sequencing techniques genetically among others, which can be quite useful for diagnosis of various diseases.

'''Techniques in Blood Bank and Transfusion Unit:''' Section blood bank and / or transfusion unit performs professional laboratory testing donated blood units to ensure they are in good condition to be transfused to a patient, tests are done as presence or absence of infectious agents that produce diseases such as HIV, Sagas disease, Hepatitis, HTLV I, syphilis and others. Equally prepared and necessary processes are separated by centrifugal units of RBCs, precipitate, and platelet units reductionist procedures among others. Different unit processes in transfusion procedures are performed to measure the compatibility of the donor - recipient, the bacteriologist must verify the absence of antibodies that produce severe thrombolytic reactions at the time of transfusion between these procedures include: cross match minor, major crosspatch, determining blood type and RH, direct Combs, Combos indirect detection of antibodies and antibodies.

All manual or automated procedures require the strictest quality control. Checks should be made internal and external quality, make the appropriate calibrations, maintenance of equipment when necessary and properly validate every bacteriologist should follow the protocols are conducted in the clinical laboratory for quality control concerns, besides being constantly updated theoretical and academic in this way make a correct clinical correlation and ensure the accuracy of the results reported to the doctor.

== Biosecurity ==
One of the most important properties that should be a bacteriologist is his biosecurity. A bacteriologist should work with the right equipment depending on the level of the laboratory where the work and the danger of working with samples, this equipment includes: gown, masks, goggles biosecurity, latex gloves, biohazard cabinet, if it is a laboratory where highly dangerous microorganisms work bacteriologist must use special biosafety suits.

Some of the samples analyzed by bacteriologists are:

* Blood samples 
* Samples of suppurative lesions 
* Samples of cerebrospinal fluid 
* Pleural fluid samples 
* Samples of ascitic fluid 
* Tissue infected 
* Samples of synovial fluid 
* Samples for urinalysis 
* Samples for stool tests 
* Samples of parasitic structures

== Competencies ==
Many medical diagnoses are based on the various examinations conducted by the bacteriologist in the clinical laboratory

A bacteriologist has general knowledge in bacteriology, hematology, parasitology, mycology, virology, immunology, genetics, cytogenetics, molecular biology, quality control, biotechnology, among other disciplines. The bacteriologist can reinforce the knowledge acquired through specialization, diploma, masters and doctoral degrees recognized by official institutions.

A bacteriologist performs in different fields as either professional or coordinator of clinical laboratory and blood banks, scientific research groups, microbiological quality control, quality control in clinical laboratory equipment epidemiology and public health, clinical laboratory veterinarian forensic clinical laboratory teaching in the fields of competence, among others. Besides this is the duty of bacteriologist transmit their knowledge to practitioners and bacteriologists future clinical laboratory professionals.

== Motivations ==
* Passion for the profession. 
* Social Status 
* Conduct research across the breadth of his knowledge. 
* Perform various specializations (Hematology, Microbiology, Clinical Chemistry, Genetics,   Cytogenetics, Immunology, etc. degree in various fields of life sciences and medical commitment to the medical staff.  
* Providing accuracy, precision, reliability, etc. of the obtained results. 
* Opportunities to expand their knowledge to any branch of biology. 
* Compensation of the work. 
* Size of workplace (clinical laboratory in different specialties, research, quality control,  clinical epidemiology, public health, industry, forensics lab, among others.

== Ethic ==
A bacteriologist have the obligation of have the following attitudes;
* Good reception and attention of the patients.
* Complete monitoring of the samples.
* To save the professional secrecy.
* To know and implement the profession ethic code established by the authorities.

== Professional career ==
In [[Colombia]] is regulated by the Bacteriologist National School ''“[http://www.cnbcolombia.org Colegio Nacional de Bacteriólogo] (CNB)”''&lt;ref name=testad&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacteriologist National School|url=http://www.cnbcolombia.org|work=Colombia|publisher=Dyservet.com|accessdate=15 May 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which determine whether the professional is ready or not to perform the professional career by the obtaining of a professional card. that qualify to the professional to perform the professional career, it is regulated by the law (Article 2 of Act 1193 of 2008 which amends Act 841 of 2003), which determines;
"The National Association of Bacteriologists assumes the functions of issuing of the professional card referred in Article 5 of Act, the Professional Cards, meanwhile inscriptions or records Bacteriologists will be issued by the Ministries of Health of the different departments"

''“While the National Association of Bacteriologists acts as the issue of the professional card referred to in Article 5 of this Law, the Professional Cards, inscriptions or records Bacteriologists will be issued by the Ministries of Health of the different departments”''&lt;ref name=testaa /&gt;

In Bioethical see National Court and Ethics Bacteriology know will handle disciplinary proceedings on appeal - Bioethics - ethics - which identify professionals who practice in the profession of bacteriology in Colombia for petty offenses established in the existing laws matter. under Article 8 of Law 1193 of 2008.

== Approval ==
Currently, to carry out the career in a different country of the initial studies, it is necessary to do a type approval or validation. As long as the professional be interested to work in the destiny country.

It is not necessary the approval or validate, when the professionals pretend to improve the knowledge in a  Hague member country ([[Apostille Convention|Hague Convention]]),  As long as the interested provided the correct documents legalization performed by the [[apostille convention]], thus as ask for the postgraduates certificate access in accordance with paragraph c of Article 14 of Act 30 of 1992 (within Colombia),&lt;ref name=texah&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Accreditation Council, Republic of Colombia|title=Act 30 of 1992|url=http://www.cna.gov.co/1741/articles-311056_Ley30_1992.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary determine whether the destiny country is on the haya member list.&lt;ref name=texaf&gt;{{cite web|publisher=cancilleria|title=Hague member countries|url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/tramites_servicios/apostilla_legalizacion/paises-convenio-de-la-haya.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bacteriologist's day ==
In [[Colombia]], 28 April is celebrated as Bacteriologist's day. However, in other countries this does not exist or is not celebrated. An international day is not present.

'''Biomesotherapy''' is an alternative therapy practice that combines [[homotoxicology]], [[mesotherapy]], and [[acupuncture]]. [[Saline solution]] and homeopathic formulations are injected subcutaneously at specific acupuncture or trigger points, and homeopathic formulations are administered orally during treatment sessions. Biomesotherapy is used for pain management and general well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivan | first1 = M | last2 = Dancer | first2 = C | last3 = Koehler | first3 = AP | last4 = Hobby | first4 = M | last5 = Lease | first5 = C | year = 2013 | title = Mycobacterium chelonae abscesses associated with biomesotherapy, Australia, 2008 | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume =  19| issue = | page =  | doi = 10.3201/eid1909.120898 | pmid=23968779 | pmc=3810901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science''''' is a 1979 book by astrophysicist [[Carl Sagan]]. Its chapters were originally articles published between 1974 and 1979 in various magazines, including ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[Physics Today]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Scientific American]]''.  In the introduction, Sagan wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science|first=Carl|last=Sagan|origyear=1979|year=2011|publisher=[[Random House Publishing Group]]|page=xiii|isbn=9780307800992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYpP6zmD9G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22broca's%20brain%22&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|As long as there have been human beings, we have posed the deep and fundamental questions...If we don't destroy ourselves, most of us will be around for the answers...  By far the most exciting, satisfying and exhilarating time to be alive is the time in which we pass from ignorance to knowledge on these fundamental issues.|p. xiii}}

==Title==
The title essay is named in honor of the French [[physician]], [[anatomist]] and [[anthropologist]], [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880). He is best known for his discovery that different functions are assigned to different parts of the brain. He believed that by studying the brains of cadavers and correlating the known experiences of the former owners of the organs, human behavior could eventually be discovered and understood. To that end, he saved hundreds of human brains in jars of [[formalin]]; among the collection is his own neural organ. When Sagan finds it in [[Musée de l'Homme]], he poses questions that challenge some core ideas of human existence such as "How much of that man known as Paul Broca can still be found in this jar?"—a question that evokes both [[Religion|religious]] and [[Science|scientific]] argument.

==Contents==

A major part of the book is devoted to debunking "paradoxers" who either live at the edge of science or are outright [[charlatan]]s. An example of this is the controversy surrounding [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s ideas presented in the book ''[[Worlds in Collision]]''. Another large part of the book discusses naming conventions for the members of our solar system and their physical features. Sagan also discusses [[Science fiction]] at some length. Here, he mentions [[Robert A. Heinlein]] as being one of his favorite science fiction authors in his childhood. [[Near death experience]]s and their cultural ambiguity is another topic of the essays. Sagan also criticizes ideas developed in [[Robert K. G. Temple]]'s book ''[[The Sirius Mystery]]'', published three years earlier in 1975.

In the final section of the book, "Ultimate Questions." Sagan writes:
{{quote|...My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, our curiosity and intelligence were provided by such a god...on the other hand if such a god does not exist then our curiosity and intelligence are the essential tools for survival. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is essential for the welfare of the human species.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6797">'''CEASE''' (Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) therapy is used by [[Naturopathy|naturopaths]] (particularly [[Homeopathy|homeopaths]]) who claim, without evidence, that it can treat or even cure people with [[autism]]. It involves a mixture of supplements, high-dose vitamin C, 'orthomolecular support', dietary restrictions and [[homeopathy]] and was developed by the late Tinus Smits - a Dutch doctor. Smits claimed to have used it to treat over 300 children with autism. The therapy became more notable in 2017/2018 because of regulatory action taken by professional bodies in The Netherlands, UK and Canada following a series of complaints about unfounded claims. 

Smits in the book "Autism Beyond Despair - CEASE Therapy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654303657|title=Autism : beyond despair : CEASE therapy|last=Tinus.|first=Smits,|date=2010|publisher=Emryss Publishers|others=Owens, Tim.|isbn=9076189285|location=[Haarlem, The Netherlands]|oclc=654303657}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that autistic children should never be vaccinated.   

In October 2017 the Dutch Advertising Code Foundation (Stichting Reclame Code) found that the official website for CEASE therapy was in breach of advertising regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reclamecode.nl/webuitspraak.asp?ID=199321&amp;acCode|title=2017/00594|publisher=Stichting Reclame|date=3 October 2017|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Homeopathy Regulation: More on CEASE Therapy |url=http://ukhomeopathyregulation.blogspot.com/2017/10/more-on-cease-therapy.html |website=UK Homeopathy Regulation |accessdate=14 July 2018 |date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care|Professional Standards Authority]] (PSA) placed some requirements on the Society of Homeopaths (SoH) when they reaccredited their members' register under their Accredited Register scheme, due to concerns about the way in which members marketed CEASE therapy. The PSA asked the SoH to confirm "what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation".&lt;ref name=CEASE120homeopaths&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/27/more-than-120-homeopaths-trying-to-cure-autism-in-uk|title=More than 120 homeopaths trying to ‘cure’ autism in UK|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the Society of Homeopaths published a position statement advising their members not to imply any cure of autism when marketing CEASE therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715064408/https://homeopathy-soh.org/society-publishes-position-statement-on-cease/|title=Society publishes position statement on CEASE|publisher=Society of Homeopaths|date=1 June 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that more than 120 homeopaths are offering CEASE in the UK though not all are SoH members.&lt;ref name=CEASE120homeopaths /&gt; In July 2015 the UK's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) found Teddington Homeopathy's marketing of CEASE therapy in breach of the Advertising Standards Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/teddington-homeopathy-a15-299143.html|title=ASA Ruling on Teddington Homeopathy|publisher=Advertising Standards Authority|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month the ASA added the company to its list of [https://www.asa.org.uk/codes-and-rulings/non-compliant-online-advertisers.html non-compliant online advertisers] for "making unproven efficacy claims for CEASE therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/non-compliant/teddington-homeopathy.html|title=Teddington Homeopathy|publisher=Advertising Standards Authority|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2018 the ASA upheld an adjudication against Bubbling Life's website, determining that the claims relating to CEASE, vaccination, autism and [[Autism_spectrum|ASD]] could discourage customers from seeking appropriate advice or treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/elle-fox--a18-443476.html|title=ASA Ruling on Bubbling Life|date=18 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[British Columbia]], Canada, the Board of the College of Naturopathic Physicians investigated three CEASE practitioners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/homeopathy-for-autism-certainly-not-based-on-science-b-c-health-official-says-1.4677128|title=Homeopathy for autism 'certainly not based on science,' B.C. health official says|publisher=CBC News|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; following complaints from the public and subsequently "determined that naturopathic doctors in British Columbia must not advertise or offer CEASE therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/naturopath-college-outlaws-therapy-promising-complete-elimination-of-autism-1.4682714|title=Naturopath college outlaws therapy that promises 'complete elimination' of autism|publisher=CBC News|date=29 May 2018 |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this prohibition the College's updated position statements also clarify that naturopathic doctors in BC must not offer anti-vaccination materials or advice (including on social media) and must not imply that vaccination causes autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpbc.bc.ca/changes-to-the-colleges-immunization-standard-and-prohibition-of-cease-therapy-2/|title=Changes to the College’s Immunization Standard and prohibition of CEASE therapy|publisher=College of Naturopathic Physicians of British Columbia|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5431">{{distinguish|Chief Scientific Adviser (disambiguation){{!}}Chief Scientific Adviser}}
A '''chief science officer''' ('''C.S.O.''') is a position at the head of scientific research operations at organizations or companies performing significant scientific research projects.

==Description==
A C.S.O. typically is responsible for envisioning and developing research capabilities (human, methodological, and technological), for developing evidence of the validity and utility of research products, and for communicating with the scientific and customer communities concerning capabilities and scientific product offerings. 

In some organizations, the same person may hold this title along with that of [[chief technology officer]] (C.T.O.). Alternatively, a company could have one or the other, or both occupied by separate people. Often, C.S.Os exists in heavily research-oriented companies, while C.T.Os exists in [[product development]] focused companies. The typical category of [[research and development]] that exists in many science and technology companies can be led by either post, depending upon which area is the organization's primary focus. 

A C.S.O. almost always has a pure science background and an advanced degree, whereas a C.T.O. often has a background in engineering or business development.

Some academic research organizations, such as the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Chase Cancer Center News {{!}} Fox Chase Cancer Center - Philadelphia, PA|url=http://www.fccc.edu/news/2008/2008-07-28-Jeff-Boyd.html|website=www.fccc.edu|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research - Dana-Farber Cancer Institute {{!}} Boston, MA|url=http://www.dana-farber.org/res/scientificreport/message-from-chief-scientific-officer.html|website=www.dana-farber.org|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] have adopted a similar title of C.S.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael L. Norman Appointed Chief Scientific Officer of SDSC|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/supercomputer/06-08MichealNorman.asp|website=ucsdnews.ucsd.edu|accessdate=1 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, their role is to evaluate and set scientific priorities and coordinate the administrative structure that supports scientists. A C.S.O. commonly has a scientific or academic background, yet they may or may not be practicing scientists or academics.

==England==

In the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], the C.S.O. is the head of profession for the 53,000 [[Healthcare science|healthcare scientists]] working in the organization and its associated bodies. The C.S.O. is one of six NHS professional officers (including the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|chief medical officer]] and the [[Chief Nursing Officer|chief nursing officer]]) who are employed within [[NHS England]]. These roles lead their own professional groups as well as providing expert knowledge about their specific disciplines to the NHS and wider health and care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/appointments/ |title=Appointments |publisher=NHS England |accessdate=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411073747/http://www.england.nhs.uk/appointments/ |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C.S.O. provides professional leadership and expert clinical advice across the health system, as well as working alongside senior clinical leaders within NHS England and the broader commissioning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/02/11/nhs-commissioning-board-appoints-its-first-chief-scientific-officer/ |title=NHS Commissioning Board appoints its first Chief Scientific Officer |publisher=Department of Health |date = 11 February 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The C.S.O. is also responsibility for delivering the government's strategy for a modernised healthcare science workforce, [[Modernising Scientific Careers]].

[[Professor Sue Hill|Professor Dame Sue Hill]] has been the C.S.O. since October 2002 first within the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|department of health]] and subsequently NHS England .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Aboutus/Chiefprofessionalofficers/Chiefscientificofficer/DH_63 |title=Chief Scientific Officer |publisher=Department of Health |accessdate=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was strengthened in March 2013, with the appointment of a deputy C.S.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/03/25/dr-fiona-carragher-appointed-deputy-chief-scientific-officer-by-nhs-commissioning-board/ |title=Fiona Carragher appointed Deputy Chief Scientific Officer by NHS Commissioning Board |publisher=Department of Health |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130123162412/http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/03/25/dr-fiona-carragher-appointed-deputy-chief-scientific-officer-by-nhs-commissioning-board/ |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmic pluralism''', the '''plurality of worlds''', or simply '''pluralism''', describes the philosophical belief in numerous "[[world]]s" ([[planet]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s or [[natural satellite]]s) in addition to [[Earth]] (possibly an infinite number), which may harbour [[extraterrestrial life]].

The debate over pluralism began as early as the time of [[Anaximander]] (c. 610 – c. 546 BC) as a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical argument]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''Commentary on Aristotle's Physics'', 1121, 5–9&lt;/ref&gt; long predating the scientific [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican conception]] that the Earth is one of numerous [[planet]]s. It has continued, in a variety of forms, until the modern era.

==Ancient Greek debates==
In [[Ancient Greece|Greek times]], the debate was largely philosophical and did not conform to present notions of [[cosmology]]. Cosmic pluralism was a corollary to notions of infinity and the purported multitude of life-bearing worlds were more akin to parallel universes (either contemporaneously in space or infinitely recurring in time) than to different solar systems. After [[Anaximander]] opened the door to an infinite universe, a strong pluralist stance was adopted by the [[atomists]], notably [[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], and [[Epicurus]]. While these were prominent thinkers, their opponents—[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]—had greater effect. They argued that the Earth is unique and that there can be no other systems of worlds.&lt;ref name=crowe1999&gt;

==Medieval Islamic thought==
Many medieval Muslim scholars endorsed the idea of cosmic pluralism. Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]  (676–733) wrote "Maybe you see that God created only this single world and that God did not create humans besides you. Well, I swear by God that God created thousands and thousands of worlds and
thousands and thousands of humankind."&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

[[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi]] (1149–1209), in dealing with his conception of physics and the physical world in his Matalib, rejects the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] notion of the Earth's centrality within the universe. Instead he argues that there are "a thousand thousand worlds (alfa alfi 'awalim) beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has."&lt;ref name =Weintraub&gt;David A. Weintraub (2014). "Islam," ''Religions and Extraterrestrial Life'' (pp 161-168). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; To support his theological argument, he cites the [[Qur'an]]ic verse, "All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds," in surah [[fatiha]] emphasizing the term "Worlds."

Two Qur'anic verses support the idea of God being Lord of multiple worlds: 1:2 and 41:09. Qur'an 16:8 says "He has created other things of which ye have no knowledge."&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

Cosmic pluralism was depicted in fictional [[Arabic literature]]. "[[The Adventures of Bulukiya]]", a tale from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), depicted a [[cosmos]] consisting of different worlds, some larger than Earth and each with their own inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=204 &amp; 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholastic thinkers==
Eventually the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian system was challenged and pluralism reasserted, first tentatively by [[scholastics]] and then more seriously by followers of [[Copernicus]]. The [[telescope]] appeared to prove that a multitude of life was reasonable and an expression of God's creative omnipotence; still powerful theological opponents, meanwhile, continued to insist that although the Earth may have been displaced from the center of the cosmos, it was still the unique focus of God's creation. Thinkers such as [[Johannes Kepler]] were willing to admit the possibility of pluralism without truly supporting it.

==Renaissance==
[[Giordano Bruno]] introduced in his works the idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One. Bruno (from the mouth of his character Philotheo) in his ''De l'infinito universo et mondi'' (1584) claims that "innumerable celestial bodies, stars, globes, suns and earths may be sensibly perceived therein by us and an infinite number of them may be inferred by our own reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Teaching this was among the charges the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]] made against him.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Firpo, Il processo di Giordano Bruno, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment==
During the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the later [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], cosmic pluralism became a mainstream possibility. [[Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]'' (''Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds'') of 1686 was an important work from this period, speculating on pluralism and describing the new Copernican cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/2529.html Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]— Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], astronomers such as [[William Herschel]] and even politicians, including [[John Adams]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. As greater [[scientific skepticism]] and rigour were applied to the question it ceased to be simply a matter of philosophy and theology and was properly bounded by astronomy and biology.

The French astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] was one of the chief proponents of cosmic pluralism during the latter half of the nineteenth century. His first book, ''La pluralité des mondes habités'' (1862) was a great popular success, going through 33 editions in its first twenty years. Flammarion was one of the first people to put forward the idea that extraterrestrial beings were genuinely alien, and not simply variations of earthly creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925)]— The Internet Encyclopedia of Science&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern thought==
In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries the term "cosmic pluralism" became largely archaic as knowledge diversified and the speculation on extraterrestrial life focused on particular bodies and observations. The historic debate continues to have modern parallels, however. [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], for instance, could well be considered "pluralists" while proponents of the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]] are modern skeptics.

Modern Islamic scholars like [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] point to the Qur'an (42:29) to argue for life on other planets: "And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them". The verses uses the word ''da’bbah'', which denotes living creatures on the surface of a planet.&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

{{Paranormal}}
'''Cryptozoology''' is a [[pseudoscience]] and [[subculture]] that aims to prove the existence of entities from the [[folklore]] record, such as [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], or [[Mokele-mbembe]]. Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as ''cryptids'', a term coined by the subculture. Because it does not follow the [[scientific method]], cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world: it is neither a branch of [[zoology]] nor [[folkloristics]].

Originally founded in the 1950s by zoologists [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], scholars have noted that the pseudoscience rejected mainstream approaches from an early date, and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science. Scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence (including the pseudoscience's association with [[young Earth creationism]]), and have noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]].

==Terminology, history, and approach==
As a field, cryptozoology originates from  the works of colleagues Bernard Heuvelmans, a [[Belgian]] zoologist, and Ivan T. Sanderson, a Scottish zoologist. Notably, Heuvelmans published ''[[On the Track of Unknown Animals]]'' (French ''Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées'') in 1955, a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works. Similarly, Sanderson published a series of books that assisted in developing hallmarks of cryptozoology, including ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life'' (1961).&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"&gt;Regal, Brian (2011) "Cryptozoology", pp. 326-329 as published in McCormick, Charlie T. and Kim Kennedy (2011). ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art''. 2nd edition. [[ABC-CLIO]]. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-241-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cryptozoology'' dates from cryptozoologist circles from 1959 or before&amp;nbsp;– Heuvelmans attributes the coinage of the term ''cryptozoology'' ('the study of hidden animals') to Sanderson.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTOZOOLOGY"&gt;Additionally, see discussion at "cryptozoology, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterned after ''cryptozoology'', the term ''cryptid'' was coined in 1983 by cryptozoologist J. E. Wall in the Summer issue of the [[International Society of Cryptozoology]] newsletter.&lt;ref name="Regal2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Regal|first=B.|title=Searching for Sasquatch: Crackpots, Eggheads, and Cryptozoology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a7GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|date=11 April 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-11829-4|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wall "[It has been] suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like 'monster'. My suggestion is 'cryptid', meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wall |first=J.E. |title=The ISC Newsletter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSfXAAAAMAAJ |date=Summer 1982 |publisher=International Society of Cryptozoology |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=10 |quote=The Spring, 1983, issue featured an interview with Paul LeBlond and Forrest Wood, in which it was suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like "monster." My suggestion is "cryptid," meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown. As far as I know, this would be an entirely new word , describing those creatures which are (or may be) subjects of cryptozoological investigation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the noun ''cryptid'' as "an animal whose existence or survival to the present day is disputed or unsubstantiated; any animal of interest to a cryptozoologist".&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTID"&gt;"cryptid, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While used by most cryptozoologists, the term ''cryptid'' is not used by academic zoologists.&lt;ref name="PAXTON-2011"&gt;Paxton, C.G.M.  (2011). "Putting the “ology” into cryptozoology." . ''Biofortean Notes''. Vol. 7, pp. 7-20, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

While biologists regularly identify new species, cryptozoologists often focus on creatures from the [[folklore]] record. Most famously, these include the [[Loch Ness Monster]], [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], as well as other "imposing beasts that could be labeled as monsters". In their hunt for these entities, cryptozoologists may employ devices such as motion-sensitive cameras, night-vision equipment, and audio-recording equipment. While there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches, unlike biologists, zoologists, botanists, and other academic disciplines, however, "there are no accepted, uniform, or successful methods for pursuing cryptids".&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt; Some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record, and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;

Few cryptozoologists have a formal science education, and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology. Adherents often misrepresent the academic backgrounds of cryptozoologists. According to writer [[Daniel Loxton]] and paleontologist [[Donald Prothero]], "Cryptozoologists have often promoted 'Professor [[Roy Mackal]], PhD.' as one of their leading figures and one of the few with a legitimate doctorate in biology. What is rarely mentioned, however, is that he had no training that would qualify him to undertake competent research on exotic animals. This raises the specter of 'credential mongering', by which an individual or organization feints a person's graduate degree as proof of expertise, even though his or her training is not specifically relevant to the field under consideration." Besides Heuvalmans, Sanderson, and Mackal, notable cryptozoologists with academic backgrounds include [[Grover Krantz]], [[Karl Shuker]], and [[Richard Greenwell]].&lt;ref name="LOXTON-PROTHERO-2013-304-305"&gt;Loxton, Daniel and Donald Prothero. 2013. ''Abominable Science: Origins of the Yeti, Nessie, and other Famous Cryptids'', p. 304-305. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-231-52681-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young Earth creationism===
A subset of cryptozoology promotes the pseudoscience of [[Young Earth creationism]], rejecting conventional science in favor of a Biblical interpretation and promoting concepts such as "[[Young Earth creationism#Flood geology, the fossil record, and dinosaurs|living dinosaur]]s". [[Science journalism|Science writer]] [[Sharon A. Hill]] observes that the Young Earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is "well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 66. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Jeb J. Card says that "Creationists have embraced cryptozoology and some cryptozoological expeditions are funded by and conducted by creationists hoping to disprove evolution."&lt;ref name="CARD-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] notes an uptick in creationist cryptozoologists. He observes that "[p]eople who actively search for Loch Ness monsters or Mokele Mbembe do it entirely as creationist ministers. They think that if they found a dinosaur in the Congo it would overturn all of evolution. It wouldn't. It would just be a late-occurring dinosaur, but that's their mistaken notion of evolution."&lt;ref name="NAT-GEO-PROTHERO"&gt;Shea, Rachel Hartigan. 2013. "The Science Behind Bigfoot and Other Monsters".''[[National Geographic]]'', September 9, 2013. [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/09/130907-cryptid-crytozoology-bigfoot-loch-yeti-monster-abominable-science/ Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and pseudoscience==
The 2003 discovery of the [[fossil]] remains of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' was cited by paleontologist [[Henry Gee]], a senior editor at the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', as possible evidence that "in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as yetis are founded on grains of truth." "Cryptozoology," Gee says, "can come in from the cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry Gee |year=2004 |journal=Nature News |url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=1329 |title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology: The discovery poses thorny questions about the uniqueness of Homo sapiens | doi = 10.1038/news041025-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, cryptozoology is widely criticised for an array of reasons and is rejected by the academic world. There is a broad consensus from academics that cryptozoology is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jeffrey A. (2000). ''The Scientific Endeavor: A Primer on Scientific Principles and Practice''. [[Benjamin Cummings]]. p. 119. {{ISBN|978-0805345964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roesch, Ben S; Moore, John L. (2002). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: Volume One''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 71-78. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}} "Pointing to this rampant speculation and ignorance of established scientific theories in cryptozoology, as well as the field's poor record of success and its reliance on unsystematic, anecdotal evidence, many scientists and skeptics classify cryptozoology as a pseudoscience."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church, Jill M. (2009). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[H. James Birx]]. ''Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology &amp; Culture, Volume 1''. [[SAGE Publications]]. pp. 251-252. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-4164-8}} "Cryptozoology has acquired a bad reputation as a pseudoscience... Until detailed, methodical research becomes standard practice among cryptozoologists, the field will remain disrespected by more traditional biologists and zoologists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lack, Caleb W; Rousseau, Jacques. (2016). ''Unknown Animals and Cryptozoology''. In ''Critical Thinking, Science and Pseudoscience: Why We Can't Trust Our Brains.'' [[Springer Publishing]]. pp. 153-174. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-9419-0}} "Cryptids are the focus of study in cryptozoology, a field most scientists label as pseudoscientific."&lt;/ref&gt; The field is regularly criticized for reliance on anecdotal information&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shermer|first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Shermer | year=2003|title=Show Me the Body|work=[[Scientific American]]|issue=288 (5)|page=27|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/05/show-me-the-body}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because in the course of investigating animals that most scientists believe are unlikely to have existed, cryptozoologists do not follow the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="luumsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown|publisher=[[Overlook Press]]|year=2000 |isbn=0-440-23656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill notes that "there is no academic course of study in cryptozoology or no university degree program that will bestow the title 'cryptozoologist'."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"/&gt;

Anthropologist Jeb J. Card summarizes cryptozoology in a survey of pseudoscience and [[pseudoarchaeology]]:

:Cryptozoology purports to be the study of previously unidentified animal species. At first glance, this would seem to differ little from zoology. New species are discovered by field and museum zoologists every year. Cryptozoologists cite these discoveries as justification of their search but often minimize or omit the fact that the discoverers do not identify as cryptozoologists and are academically trained zoologists working in an ecological paradigm rather than organizing expeditions to seek out supposed examples of unusual and large creatures.&lt;ref name="CARD-23-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 23-32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card notes that "cryptozoologists often show their disdain and even hatred for professional scientists, including those who enthusiastically participated in cryptozoology", which he traces back to Heuvelmans's early "rage against critics of cryptozoology". He finds parallels with cryptozoology and other pseudosciences, such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]], and compares the approach of cryptozoologists to colonial big-game hunters, and to aspects of European imperialism. According to Card, "Most cryptids are framed as the subject of indigenous legends typically collected in the hayday of [[comparative folklore]], though such legends may be heavily modified or worse. Cryptozoology's complicated mix of sympathy, interest, and appropriation of indigenous culture (or non-indigenous construction of it) is also found in [[New Age]] circles and dubious "[[Indian burial grounds]]" and other [[legend]]s ... invoked in [[haunting]]s such as the [[The Amityville Horror|"Amityville" hoax]] ...".&lt;ref name="CARD-24-25"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 24-25. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 foreword for ''The American Biology Teacher'', then [[National Association of Biology Teachers]] president [[Dan Ward (educator)|Dan Ward]] uses cryptozoology as an example of "technological pseudoscience" that may confuse students about the scientific method. Ward says that "Cryptozoology … is not valid science or even science at all. It is monster hunting."&lt;ref name="WARD-2011"&gt;Ward, Daniel. 2011. “From the President”. The American Biology Teacher 73.8 (2011): 440–440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of science|Historian of science]] [[Brian Regal]] includes an entry for cryptozoology in his ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (2009). Regal says that "as an intellectual endeavor, cryptozoology has been studied as much as cryptozoologists have sought hidden animals".&lt;ref name="NAGEL-50"&gt;Nagel, Brian. 2009. ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'', p. 50. [[ABC-CLIO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1992 issue of ''[[The Folklore Society|Folklore]]'', [[folkloristics|folklorist]] Véronique Campion-Vincent says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Unexplained appearances of mystery animals are reported all over the world today. Beliefs in the existence of fabulous and supernatural animals are ubiquitous and timeless. In the continents discovered by Europe indigenous beliefs and tales have strongly influenced the perceptions of the conquered confronted by a new natural environment. In parallel with the growing importance of the scientific approach, these traditional mythical tales have been endowed with sometimes highly artificial precision and have given birth to contemporary legends solidly entrenched in their territories. The belief self-perpetuates today through multiple observations enhanced by the media and encouraged (largely with the aim of gain for touristic promotion) by the local population, often genuinely convinced of the reality of this profitable phenomenon."&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"&gt;Campion-Vincent, Véronique. 1992. “Appearances of Beasts and Mystery-cats in France”. ''Folklore'' 103.2 (1992): 160–183.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Campion-Vincent says that "four currents can be distinguished in the study of mysterious animal appearances": "Forteans" ("compiler[s] of anomalies" such as via publications like the ''[[Fortean Times]]''), "occultists" (which she describes as related to "Forteans"), "folklorists", and "cryptozoologists". Regarding cryptozoologists, Campion-Vincent says that "this movement seems to deserve the appellation of parascience, like [[parapsychology]]: the same corpus is reviewed; many scientists participate, but for those who have an official status of university professor or researcher, the participation is a private hobby".&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"/&gt;

In her ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', academic [[Linda Watts]] says that "folklore concerning unreal animals or beings, sometimes called monsters, is a popular field of inquiry" and describes cryptozoology as an example of "American narrative traditions" that "feature many monsters".&lt;ref name="WATTS-271"&gt;Watts, Linda S. 2007. ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', p. 271. [[Facts on File]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of cryptozoology, folklorist [[Peter Dendle]] says that "cryptozoology devotees consciously position themselves in defiance of mainstream science" and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The psychological significance of cryptozoology in the modern world .. serves to channel guilt over the decimation of species and destruction of the natural habitat; to recapture a sense of mysticism and danger in a world now perceived as fully charted and over-explored; and to articulate resentment of and defiance against a scientific community perceived as monopolising the pool of culturally acceptable beliefs.&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2006-190-206"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2006. "Cryptozoology in the Medieval and Modern Worlds". ''Folklore'', Vol. 117, No. 2 (Aug., 2006), pp. 190-206. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a paper published in 2013, Dendle refers to cryptozoologists as "contemporary monster hunters" that "keep alive a sense of wonder in a world that has been very thoroughly charted, mapped, and tracked, and that is largely available for close scrutiny on Google Earth and satellite imaging" and that "on the whole the devotion of substantial resources for this pursuit betrays a lack of awareness of the basis for scholarly consensus (largely ignoring, for instance, evidence of evolutionary biology and the fossil record)."&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2013-439"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2013.

According to historian [[Mike Dash]], few scientists doubt there are thousands of unknown animals, particularly invertebrates, awaiting discovery; however, cryptozoologists are largely uninterested in researching and cataloging newly discovered species of [[ant]]s or [[beetle]]s, instead focusing their efforts towards "more elusive" creatures that have often defied decades of work aimed at confirming their existence.&lt;ref name="luumsh"/&gt;

Paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1984) lists cryptozoology among examples of human gullibility, along with [[creationism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Humans are the most inventive, deceptive, and gullible of all animals. Only those characteristics can explain the belief of some humans in creationism, in the arrival of UFO's with extraterrestrial beings, or in some aspects of cryptozoology. … In several respects the discussion and practice of cryptozoology sometimes, although not invariably, has demonstrated both deception and gullibility. An example seems to merit the old Latin saying 'I believe because it is incredible,' although Tertullian, its author, applied it in a way more applicable to the present day creationists.&lt;ref name="SIMPSON-1984-1-16"&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord (1984). "Mammals and Cryptozoology". ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''. Vol. 128, No. 1 (Mar. 30, 1984), pp. 1-19. [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paleontologist Donald Prothero (2007) cites cryptozoology as an example of pseudoscience, and categorizes it along with [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Ufology#As a pseudoscience|UFO abductions claims]] as aspects of American culture that are "clearly baloney".&lt;ref name="PROTHERO-2007"&gt;[[Donald R. Prothero|Prothero, Donald R.]]. 2007. ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters'', pp. 13-15. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780231511421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'' (2017), Hill surveys the field and discusses aspects of the subculture, noting internal attempts at creating more scientific approaches and the involvement of [[Young Earth creationists]] and a prevalence of hoaxes. She concludes that many cryptozoologists are "passionate and sincere in their belief that mystery animals exist. As such, they give deference to every report of a sighting, often without criticial questioning. As with the [[ghost hunting|ghost seekers]], cryptozoologists are convinced that they will be the ones to solve the mystery and make history. With the lure of mystery and money undermining diligent and ethical research, the field of cryptozoology has serious credibility problems."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-56-68"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017.

== Organizations ==
There have been several organizations, of varying types, dedicated or related to cryptozoology. These include:
{{Incomplete list|date=May 2018}}

* [[Centre for Fortean Zoology]] - a non-profit organisation based in the United Kingdom

An '''engineering technician'''  is primarily trained in the [[skill]]s and techniques related to a specific branch of [[engineering]], with a practical understanding of the relevant engineering concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos112.htm US Department of Labor job Description]&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering technicians often assist [[engineer]]s and [[Engineering technologist|technologist]]s in projects relating to [[research and development]], or focus on post-development activities like implementation or operation. An engineering technician is between a [[skilled worker|skilled craft worker]] and a technologist.

The [[Dublin Accord]] was signed in 2002 as an international agreement for the recognition of engineering technician qualifications. The Dublin Accord is analogous to the [[Washington Accord]] for [[engineer]]s and the [[Sydney Accord]] for [[engineering technologist]]s.

==Nature of work==
Engineering technicians help solve technical problems in many ways. They build or set up equipment, conduct experiments, and collect data and calculate results. They might also help to make a model of new equipment. Some technicians work in quality control, where they check products, do tests, and collect data. In manufacturing, they help to design and develop products. They also find ways to produce things efficiently.There are multiple fields in this job such as; software design, repair, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/k12/science05.htm Engineering Technician&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
They may also be people who produce [[technical drawing]]s or [[engineering drawing]]s.

==Education==
Engineering technician diplomas and 2-year degrees are generally offered by [[technical school]]s and non-[[university]] [[higher education]] institutions like colleges of further education, [[industrial school]]s, and [[community college]]s. Many 4-year colleges and universities offer bachelor's degrees in engineering technology, but engineering technologists are somewhat different from technicians.&lt;ref name=BLS2&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineering Technicians|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-technicians.htm#tab-2|work=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2012-13 Edition|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, there were [[vocational education]] schools that may have also conferred the title without awarding any degrees.

Both [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] use the title of ''engenharia técnica''/''ingeniería técnica'', literally "technical engineering", for the professionals who were awarded a short-cycle 3- to 4-year undergraduate degree ([[associate degree]] or [[bachelor's degree]]) in a [[technology|technical]] [[engineering]] field by colleges or technical engineering institutes in the case of Portugal, and universities in Spain. Spanish "technical engineers" have full competency in their respective professional field of engineering, being the difference that the three or four year Engineers have competence only in their speciality (Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, etc.)and the "Engineering Superior School" Engineers have wider competences.

In the [[United States]], the Technology Accreditation Commission of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) grants 2-year associate degree programs to students that meet a set of specified standards. These programs include at least a college algebra and trigonometry course and, if needed, one or two basic science courses at any accredited school. The number of math and science prerequisite courses depends on the branch of engineering that the student chooses.

Engineering technicians apply scientific and engineering skills usually gained in [[post secondary]] programs below the bachelor's degree level or through short-cycle bachelor's degrees. However, some university institutions award undergraduate degrees in the field of engineering which may confer the title of Engineering technician to the student, who is, however, eligible to become a fully chartered engineer after further studies at the master's degree level.  Engineering technicians are called professional engineers in the UK only.

==Certification==
In [[Canada]], the term '''certified engineering technician''' is protected by legislation and can only be used by technicians certified by provincial member organizations of the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]], such as the [[Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists]] and the [http://www.aset.ab.ca  Association of Science and Engineering Technology Professionals of Alberta].

In the [[United Kingdom]], the term '''Engineering Technician''' and [[post-nominals]] '''EngTech''' are protected in civil law, and can only be used by technicians registered with the [[Engineering Council UK]].

The term [[engineer]] is not protected in the UK, however those holding EngTech accreditation can be employed as Engineers, providing they have the additional experience/qualifications.  In the UK the term "Engineer" is used by thousands of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled trades.

In the eyes of professional engineers (but not the public) It is more acceptable to reserve the title 'Engineer' until you can fulfil the criteria required by the [[Engineering Council UK]] for Incorporated Engineer (IEng) or Chartered Engineer (CEng) status - A Bachelors / Masters Engineer Degree and additional professional practice experience (minimum 4 years), as well as a nominated sponsor who can verify your claims is the most common method for IEng/CEng accreditation.

This procedure helps reduce the saturation of the term 'Engineer', a concern to many who have completed years of undergraduate and postgraduate study and often work as 'Junior Support Engineers' for a number of years after graduation before being able to confidently state their profession.

'''Extrasensory perception''' or '''ESP''', also called '''sixth sense''' or '''[[second sight]]''', includes claimed reception of information not gained through the recognized physical [[sense]]s, but sensed with the mind. The term was adopted by Duke University psychologist [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] to denote [[psychic]] abilities such as [[intuition]], [[telepathy]], [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], [[Clairvoyance#Clairaudience (hearing/listening)|clairaudience]], and [[clairvoyance]], and their trans-temporal operation as [[precognition]] or [[retrocognition]].&lt;ref name="SheehyChapman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Noel Sheehy|author2=Antony J.

[[Parapsychology]] is the study of paranormal psychic phenomena, including ESP. Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research.&lt;ref name="Cordón"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cordón, Luis A. |title=Popular psychology: an encyclopedia |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |location=Westport, Conn |year=2005 |page= 182|isbn=0-313-32457-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |quote=The essential problem is that a large portion of the scientific community, .including most research psychologists, regards parapsychology as a pseudoscience, due largely to its failure to move beyond null results in the way science usually does.

Within parapsychology, however, more than a century of experimentation has failed even to conclusively demonstrate the mere existence of paranormal phenomenon, yet parapsychologists continue to pursue that elusive goal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scientific community]] rejects ESP due to the absence of an evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain ESP and the lack of positive experimental results; it considers ESP to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Diaconis, Persi.

==History==
[[File:Cartas Zener.svg|thumb|[[Zener cards]] were first used in the 1930s for experimental research into ESP.]]
[[File:Hubert Pearce with J. B. Rhine.png|thumb|[[Hubert Pearce]] with [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]].]]

In the 1930s, at [[Duke University]] in North Carolina, [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] and his wife [[Louisa E. Rhine]] conducted investigation into extrasensory perception. While Louisa Rhine concentrated on collecting accounts of spontaneous cases, J. B. Rhine worked largely in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and ''psi'' and designing experiments to test them. A simple set of cards was developed, originally called [[Zener card]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – now called ESP cards. They bear the symbols circle, square, wavy lines, cross, and star; there are five cards of each in a pack of 25.

In a telepathy experiment, the "sender" looks at a series of cards while the "receiver" guesses the symbols. To try to observe clairvoyance, the pack of cards is hidden from everyone while the receiver guesses. To try to observe precognition, the order of the cards is determined after the guesses are made. Later he used dice to test for [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sladek, John. (1974). ''The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs''. Panther. pp. 172–174. {{ISBN|0-87281-712-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansel, C. E. M. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-evaluation''. Prometheus Books. pp. 86–122. {{ISBN|978-0879751203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked criticism from academics and others who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine's experiments with failure. W. S. Cox (1936) from [[Princeton University]] with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded "There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Cox, W. S. (1936). ''An experiment in ESP''. Journal of Experimental Psychology 12: 437.&lt;/ref&gt; Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[C. E. M. Hansel]] ''The Search for a Demonstration of ESP'' in [[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 105–127. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}

In 1938, the psychologist [[Joseph Jastrow]] wrote that much of the evidence for extrasensory perception collected by Rhine and other parapsychologists was anecdotal, biased, dubious and the result of "faulty observation and familiar human frailties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow]]. (1938). ''ESP, House of Cards''. The American Scholar 8: 13–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhine's experiments were discredited due to the discovery that [[sensory leakage]] or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Gulliksen]]. (1938). ''Extra-Sensory Perception: What Is It?''. American Journal of Sociology. Vol. 43, No. 4. pp. 623–634. "Investigating Rhine's methods, we find that his mathematical methods are wrong and that the effect of this error would in some cases be negligible and in others very marked. We find that many of his experiments were set up in a manner which would tend to increase, instead of to diminish, the possibility of systematic clerical errors; and lastly, that the ESP cards can be read from the back."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Charles M; Wiggins, Arthur W. (2001). ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins''. Joseph Henry Press. p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-309-07309-7}} "In 1940, Rhine coauthored a book, ''Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years'' in which he suggested that something more than mere guess work was involved in his experiments. He was right! It is now known that the experiments conducted in his laboratory contained serious methodological flaws. Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester’s eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester’s facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 122. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}} "The procedural errors in the Rhine experiments have been extremely damaging to his claims to have demonstrated the existence of ESP. Equally damaging has been the fact that the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jonathan C. (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sJgONrua8IkC&amp;pg=PT226&amp;dq=rhine+pseudoscience&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MI2fUr7qIMqrhQelt4HgAg&amp;ved=0CDcQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rhine%20pseudoscience&amp;f=false ''Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit'']. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1405181228}}. "Today, researchers discount the first decade of Rhine's work with Zener cards. Stimulus leakage or cheating could account for all his findings. Slight indentations on the backs of cards revealed the symbols embossed on card faces. Subjects could see and hear the experimenter, and note subtle but revealing facial expressions or changes in breathing."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s parapsychologists became increasingly interested in the cognitive components of ESP, the subjective experience involved in making ESP responses, and the role of ESP in psychological life. This called for experimental procedures that were not limited to Rhine's favored forced-choice methodology. Such procedures have included [[dream telepathy]] experiments, and the [[ganzfeld experiment]]s (a mild sensory deprivation procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Marks, David; Kammann, Richard. (2000).

University Press of America. p. 227. {{ISBN|978-0761810674}} "When an experiment can't be repeated and get the same result, this tends to show that the result was due to some error in experimental procedure, rather than some real causal process.

Prometheus Books. p. 193. {{ISBN|978-0-87975-440-2}} "Transmission of information through space requires transfer of energy from one place to another. Telepathy requires transmission of an energy-carrying signal directly from one mind to another. All descriptions of ESP imply violations of conservation of energy in one way or another, as well as violations of all the principles of information theory and even of the principle of causality.

This is something that parapsychology has never succeeded in producing."&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics have pointed out that there is no viable theory to explain the mechanism behind ESP, and that there are historical cases in which flaws have been discovered in the experimental design of parapsychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;

There are many criticisms pertaining to experiments involving extrasensory perception, particularly surrounding methodological flaws. These flaws are not unique to a single experimental design, and are effective in discrediting much of the positive research surrounding ESP. Many of the flaws seen in the [[Zener cards]] experiment are present in the Ganzfeld experiment as well. First is the stacking effect, an error that occurs in ESP research. Trial-by-trial feedback given in studies using a “closed” ESP target sequence (e.g., a deck of cards) violates the condition of independence used for most standard statistical tests. Multiple responses for a single target cannot be evaluated using statistical tests that assume independence of responses. This increases likelihood of card counting and in turn, increases the chances for the subject to guess correctly without using ESP. Another methodological flaw involves cues through sensory leakage. For example, when the subject receives a visual cue. This could be the reflection of a Zener card in the holder’s glasses. In this case, the subject is able to guess the card correctly because they can see it in the reflection, not because of ESP. Finally, poor randomization of target stimuli could be happening. Poor shuffling methods can make the orders of the cards easier to predict, or the cards could’ve been marked and manipulated, again, making it easier to predict which cards come next.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, J. &amp; Wiseman, R. (1999). Does psi exist? Lack of replication of an anomalous process of information transfer. Psychological Bulletin, 125, 387–191. - meta-analysis of parapsychological research over 10 years following agreement on methodological criteria by proponents and skeptics.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The results of a meta-analysis found that when these errors were corrected and accounted for, there was still no significant effect of ESP. Many of the studies only appeared to have significant occurrence of ESP, when in fact, this result was due to the many methodological errors in the research.

The concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, chiefly in works of [[science fiction]]. Over the years, science fiction communicated scientific ideas, imagined a wide range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives of extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.

===Evolution===
A study published in 2017 suggests that due to how complexity evolved in species on Earth, the level of predictability for alien evolution elsewhere would make them look similar to life on our planet. One of the study authors, Sam Levin, notes "Like humans, we predict that they are made-up of a hierarchy of entities, which all cooperate to produce an alien. At each level of the organism there will be mechanisms in place to eliminate conflict, maintain cooperation, and keep the organism functioning. We can even offer some examples of what these mechanisms will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-10-31-aliens-may-be-more-us-we-think |title=Aliens may be more like us than we think |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential [[Planetary habitability|niches a planet]] contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary exobiology: Towards the qualitative assessment of biological potential on exoplanets |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |first1=David S. |last1=Stevenson |first2=Sean |last2=Large |date=25 October 2017 |doi=10.1017/S1473550417000349 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life on Earth requires [[water]] as a [[solvent]] in which biochemical reactions take place.

These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. The great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide the bases—even exotic ones—for the chemical composition of life on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=To Utopia and Back: The Search for Life in the Solar System |publisher=W.

The [[panspermia]] hypothesis proposes that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the [[Solar System]], it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth could have been seeded from elsewhere ([[Exogenesis (astrobiology)|exogenesis]]). The first known mention of the term 'panspermia' was in the writings of the 5th century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Anaxagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anaxagoras and the Origin of Panspermia Theory |publisher=iUniverse |first=Margaret R. |last=O'Leary |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-595-49596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century it was again revived in modern form by several scientists, including [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] (1834),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Analysis of the Alais meteorite and implications about life in other worlds |journal=[[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] |first=Jöns Jacob |last=Berzelius |author-link=Jöns Jacob Berzelius |volume=10 |pages=134–135 |date=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] (1871),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The British Association Meeting at Edinburgh |journal=Nature |first=William |last=Thomson |author-link=William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin |volume=4 |issue=92 |pages=261–278 |date=August 1871 |doi=10.1038/004261a0 |bibcode=1871Natur...4..261. |quote=We must regard it as probably to the highest degree that there are countless seed-bearing meteoritic stones moving through space. |pmc=2070380}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1879)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Darwin's Contribution to the Development of the Panspermia Theory |journal=Astrobiology |first=René |last=Demets |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=946–950 |date=October 2012 |doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0790 |pmid=23078643 |bibcode=2012AsBio..12..946D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, somewhat later, by [[Svante Arrhenius]] (1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/worldsinmakingev00arrhrich |title=Worlds in the Making: The Evolution of the Universe |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |first=Svante |last=Arrhenius |others=trans.

[[Sir Fred Hoyle]] (1915–2001) and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] (born 1939) are important proponents of the hypothesis who further contended that life forms continue to enter [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for [[macroevolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hoyle.org.uk/resources/virusesfromspacecompressed.pdf |title=Viruses from Space and Related Matters |publisher=University College Cardiff Press |first1=Fred |last1=Hoyle |first2=Chandra |last2=Wickramasinghe |first3=John |last3=Watson |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-906449-93-6 |bibcode=1986vfsr.book.....H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new stellar systems with life.

However, between an altitude of 50 and 65 kilometers, the pressure and temperature are Earth-like, and it has been speculated that thermoacidophilic  [[extremophile]] [[microorganisms]] might exist in the acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2843-acidic-clouds-of-venus-could-harbour-life.html |title=Acidic clouds of Venus could harbour life |work=New Scientist |first=Stuart |last=Clark |date=26 September 2003 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Martin (25 May 2004).

Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] has been subject to speculation about the existence of life due to the strong possibility of a liquid water ocean beneath its ice surface.&lt;ref name="Tritt2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulze-Makuch2001"/&gt; [[Hydrothermal vent]]s on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the ice and could be capable of supporting multicellular [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="EuropaPlanetary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |title=Projects: Europa Mission Campaign |publisher=The Planetary Society |first=Louis |last=Friedman |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811002508/http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Europa could support aerobic macrofauna using oxygen created by cosmic rays impacting its surface ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europa Capable of Supporting Life, Scientist Says |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |year=2009 |publisher=Universe Today |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2009/10/08/europa-capable-of-supporting-life-scientist-says/ |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case for life on Europa was greatly enhanced in 2011 when it was discovered that vast lakes exist within Europa's thick, icy shell. Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa's surface could be transferred to its interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/17/huge-lakes-of-water-may-exist-under-europas-ice/ |title=Huge lakes of water may exist under Europa's ice |series=Bad Astronomy Blog |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2011/11/scientists-find-evidence-for-great-lake-on-europa/ |title=Scientists Find Evidence for "Great Lake" on Europa and Potential New Habitat for Life |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models of heat retention and heating via [[radioactive decay]] in smaller icy Solar System bodies suggest that [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], [[Pluto (dwarf planet)|Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]] may have oceans underneath solid icy crusts approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km thick.&lt;ref name="Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2006.06.005| last1 = Hussmann| first1 = Hauke| last2 = Sohl| first2 = Frank| last3 = Spohn| first3 = Tilman| date = November 2006| title = Subsurface oceans and deep interiors of medium-sized outer planet satellites and large trans-neptunian objects| journal = [[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]| volume = 185| issue = 1| pages = 258–273| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225019299| bibcode = 2006Icar..185..258H| ref = {{sfnRef|Hussmann Sohl et al.|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest in these cases is the fact that the models indicate that the liquid layers are in direct contact with the rocky core, which allows efficient mixing of minerals and salts into the water.

The rover landed on Mars at [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name="Gale Crater2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chow |first1=Dennis |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover to Land at Huge Gale Crater |url=http://www.space.com/12394-nasa-mars-rover-landing-site-unveiled.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Crater3"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Mars rover aims for deep crater |date=22 July 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] stipulates that any planet with a robust population of life will have an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, which is relatively easy to determine from a distance by [[spectroscopy]]. However, significant advances in the ability to find and resolve light from smaller rocky worlds near their star are necessary before such spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze extrasolar planets. To that effect, the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] was founded in 2014 and is dedicated to the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in [[circumstellar habitable zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |title=Introducing: The Carl Sagan Institute |last=Glaser |first=Linda |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227012302/http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CSI-Research'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/research/ |title=Carl Sagan Institute – Research |date=May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary spectroscopic data will be obtained  from telescopes like [[Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope|WFIRST]] and [[Extremely Large Telescope|ELT]].&lt;ref name="ColorCatalog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cofield |first=Calla |url=http://www.space.com/28906-alien-life-earth-microbe-catalog.html |title=Catalog of Earth Microbes Could Help Find Alien Life |work=Space.com |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sugar Found In Space |journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=29 August 2012 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/ |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweet!

In 1961, [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[astronomer]] and [[astrophysicist]]  [[Frank Drake]] devised the [[Drake equation]] as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).&lt;ref name='December 2002'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm |title=Chapter 3 — Philosophy: "Solving the Drake Equation |accessdate=24 July 2015 |date=December 2002 |publisher=SETI League}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drake equation is a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the [[Milky Way]]  [[galaxy]]. The equation is best understood not as an equation in the strictly mathematical sense, but to summarize all the various concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of life elsewhere.&lt;ref name='Burchell'&gt;{{cite journal |title=W(h)ither the Drake equation? |last=Burchell |first=M. J. |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=243–250 |date=2006 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=597376&amp;fileId=S1473550406003107 |doi=10.1017/S1473550406003107 |bibcode=2006IJAsB...5..243B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Drake equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;N = R_{\ast} \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_{\ell} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''N'' = the number of Milky Way galaxy [[civilization]]s already capable of communicating across [[interplanetary space]]

and
:''R''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; = the average rate of [[star formation]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of those stars that have [[planet]]s
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; = the average number of planets that can potentially support [[life]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets that actually support life
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become [[intelligence|intelligent]] life (civilizations)
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space
:''L'' = the length of time over which such civilizations broadcast detectable signals into space

Drake's proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:

&lt;math&gt;10{,}000 = 5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 1 \cdot 10{,}000&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="NOVA"&gt;{{cite web |last=Aguirre |first=L. |date=1 July 2008 |title=The Drake Equation |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/drake.html |work=[[Nova ScienceNow]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drake equation has proved controversial since several of its factors are uncertain and based on conjecture, not allowing conclusions to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 6: What does a Martian look like? |title=Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |first1=Jack |last1=Cohen |author1-link=Jack Cohen (scientist) |first2=Ian |last2=Stewart |author2-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician) |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-09-187927-3|title-link=Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led critics to label the equation a [[guesstimate]], or even meaningless.

Based on observations from the ''[[Hubble Space Telescope]]'', there are between 125 and 250 billion galaxies in the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-many-galaxies/ |title=How many galaxies are there in the universe? |last=Temming |first=M. |work=Sky &amp; Telescope |date=18 July 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at least ten percent of all Sun-like stars have a system of planets,&lt;ref name="marcyprogth05"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Marcy |first2=R. |last2=Butler |first3=D. |last3=Fischer |display-authors=etal |title=Observed Properties of Exoplanets: Masses, Orbits and Metallicities |journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics Supplement |year=2005 |volume=158 |issue= |pages=24–42 |url=http://ptp.ipap.jp/link?PTPS/158/24 |doi=10.1143/PTPS.158.24 |arxiv=astro-ph/0505003 |bibcode=2005PThPS.158...24M |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002085400/http://ptp.ipap.jp/link?PTPS%2F158%2F24 |archivedate=2 October 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. there are {{val|6.25|e=18}} stars with planets orbiting them in the observable universe. Even if it is assumed that only one out of a billion of these stars has planets supporting life, there would be some 6.25 billion life-supporting planetary systems in the observable universe.

A 2013 study based on results from the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'']] spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets.&lt;ref name="Swift2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Characterizing the Cool KOIs.

The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for such civilizations is known as the [[Fermi paradox]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20150803"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=The Flip Side of Optimism About Life on Other Planets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/space/the-flip-side-of-optimism-about-life-on-other-planets.html |date=3 August 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==

===Cosmic pluralism===
{{main article|Cosmic pluralism}}
Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous "worlds" in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. Before the development of the [[heliocentric]] theory and a recognition that the Sun is just one of many stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html |title=Who discovered that the Sun was a Star? |publisher=Stanford Solar Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of pluralism was largely [[mythology|mythological]] and philosophical.&lt;ref name=crowe1999&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4TZPlihVUoC |title=The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900 |first=Michael J. |last=Crowe |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-486-40675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin D. |last=Wiker |date=4 November 2002 |title=Alien Ideas: Christianity and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life |url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2002/feature7.htm |work=Crisis Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030210140752/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2002/feature7.htm |archivedate=10 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion |first=Robert |last=Irwin |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-86064-983-7 |page=204 &amp; 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Muslim writers like [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] and [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name =Weintraub&gt;David A. Weintraub (2014). "Islam," ''Religions and Extraterrestrial Life'' (pp 161-168). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[scientific revolution|scientific]] and [[Copernican revolution]]s, and later, during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], cosmic pluralism became a mainstream notion, supported by the likes of [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] in his 1686 work ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds |publisher=University of California Press |first=Bernard le Bovier |last=de Fontenelle |others=trans. H. A. Hargreaves |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-520-91058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and astronomers such as [[William Herschel]]. The astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] promoted the notion of cosmic pluralism in his 1862 book ''La pluralité des mondes habités''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html |title=Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925) |publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these notions of pluralism were based on any specific observation or scientific information.

===Early modern period===
There was a dramatic shift in thinking initiated by the invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] assault on geocentric cosmology. Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds "have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth" and, like Earth, "contain animals and inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |publisher= |accessdate=4 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that "if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm |publisher=cosmovisions.com |title=Rheita.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.
The didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in "Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds" (1647).
In "The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books" (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: "We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested "our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere". [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s "Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.

The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed "cosmic pluralism" included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. At the height of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], even the [[Sun]] and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.

===19th century===
[[File:Lowell Mars channels.jpg|thumb|Artificial Martian channels, depicted by Percival Lowell]]

Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent [[Martian canals]]—which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Experiments as to the actuality of the "Canals" observed on Mars |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |first1=J. E. |last1=Evans |first2=E. W. |last2=Maunder |author2-link=Edward Walter Maunder |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=488–499 |date=June 1903 |doi=10.1093/mnras/63.8.488 |bibcode=1903MNRAS..63..488E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer [[Percival Lowell]] published his book ''Mars,'' followed by ''Mars and its Canals'' in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization.&lt;ref name="Wallace1907"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm |title=Is Mars Habitable? A Critical Examination of Professor Lowell's Book "Mars and Its Canals," With an Alternative Explanation |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |first=Alfred Russel |last=Wallace |date=1907 |oclc=8257449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of life on Mars led British writer [[H. G. Wells]] to write the novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet's desiccation.

[[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] analysis of Mars's atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer [[William Wallace Campbell]] showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the [[Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Paul |last=Chambers |title=Life on Mars; The Complete Story |place=London |publisher=Blandford |year=1999 |doi= |isbn=978-0-7137-2747-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.

The [[science fiction]] genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the Moon]]'' (1870) features a discussion of the possibility of life on the Moon, but with the conclusion that it is barren.
Stories involving extraterrestrials are found in e.g. [[Garrett P. Serviss]]'s ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'' (1898), an unauthorized sequel to
''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by H. G. Wells was published in 1897 which stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the "Martian invasion" of Earth prominent in 20th-century pop culture.

Most [[unidentified flying object]]s or [[List of UFO sightings|UFO sightings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anne |last=Cross |title=The Flexibility of Scientific Rhetoric: A Case Study of UFO Researchers |journal=Qualitiative Sociology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=3–34 |doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000015542.28438.41 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be readily explained as sightings of Earth-based aircraft, known [[astronomical object]]s, or as [[hoax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philippe |last=Ailleris |date=January–February 2011 |title=The lure of local SETI: Fifty years of field experiments |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=68 |issue=1–2 |pages=2–15 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.12.011 |bibcode=2011AcAau..68....2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a certain fraction of the public believe that UFOs might actually be of extraterrestrial origin, and, indeed, the notion has had influence on popular culture.

The possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains open.

===Recent history===
The failure so far of the [[SETI]] program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in [[pseudoscience]], conspiracy theories, and in popular [[folklore]], notably "[[Sector Four|Area 51]]" and [[Planets proposed in religion and ufology|legends]]. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.

In the words of SETI's Frank Drake, "All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.

In 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |first1=Peter |last1=Ward |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |date=2000 |bibcode=2000rewc.book.....W |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).

Theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in [[Americas|America]], which didn't turn out well for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hawking warns over alien beings |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] had earlier expressed similar concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 12 |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal |publisher=Harper Perennial |first=Jared M. |last=Diamond |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-06-084550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, "The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"&gt;{{cite web |last=Larson |first=Phil |title=Searching for ET, But No Evidence Yet |url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[White House]] |accessdate=6 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124052154/https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/Petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |archivedate=24 November 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=No Alien Visits or UFO Coverups, White House Says |url=http://www.universetoday.com/90717/no-alien-visits-or-ufo-coverups-white-house-says/ |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[UniverseToday]] |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the response, there is "no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt; The response noted "odds are pretty high" that there may be life on other planets but "the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent ones]]—are extremely small, given the distances involved."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;

In 2013, the [[exoplanet]] [[Kepler-62f]] was discovered, along with [[Kepler-62e]] and [[Kepler-62c]]. A related [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132.toc special issue] of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', published earlier, described the discovery of the exoplanets.&lt;ref name="SCI-20130503"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Special Issue: Exoplanets |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/exoplanets/ |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2014, the discovery of the Earth-size exoplanet [[Kepler-186f]], 500 light-years from [[Earth]], was publicly announced;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140417"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Scientists Find an 'Earth Twin', or Maybe a Cousin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/science/space/scientists-find-an-earth-twin-or-maybe-a-cousin.html |date=17 April 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the first Earth-size planet to be discovered in the [[habitable zone]] and it has been hypothesized that there may be liquid water on its surface.

On 20 July 2015, British physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] and Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], along with the [[SETI Institute]], announced a well-funded effort, called the [[Breakthrough Initiatives]], to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.  The group contracted the services of the 100-meter Robert C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">'''''Frame, Journal of Literary Studies''''' is a biannual journal run by (former) students of [[literature]] and [[literary theory]] (most from [[Utrecht University]])'''''.''''' Since its establishment in 1984 it has been the only Dutch publication forum that allows for a centered discussion on comparative literary studies. The journal publishes articles by international researchers as well as academic lectures, interviews, and critical reviews.  
Issues of ''Frame'' usually concentrate on a topic that resonates with cutting-edge research, debates, and discussions within the field of contemporary literary studies, and its editors select articles that provide readers with wide-ranging insight into the current topic. In the special "Masterclass" section, ''Frame'' offers Master students of literature the opportunity to acquire much-needed publishing experience. The journal furthermore offers room for conference announcements, symposiums or workshop reports, lectures, and interviews.

In the past, ''Frame'' has had the opportunity to work with well-known researchers such as [[Jonathan Culler]], [[N. Katherine Hayles]], [[J. Hillis Miller]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]]

'''FuseNet''' is an organization that unites, coordinates and sponsors European educational efforts in the field of [[nuclear fusion]] in order to increase, enhance, and broaden fusion training and education activities in [[Europe]].

== The FP7 Project ==
The FuseNet project exists of the establishment of a European Fusion Education Network (FuseNet) for education in fusion science and technology. The purpose of FuseNet is to coordinate and facilitate fusion education, to share best practices, to jointly develop educational tools, to organize educational events. The members of FuseNet have jointly established academic criteria for the award of European Fusion Doctorate and Master Certificates. These criteria are set to stimulate a high level of fusion education throughout Europe.

The FuseNet project started in October 2008 as a Coordination and Support Action under the [[seventh Framework Programme]], with financial support of the [[European Commission]]. The project consists of eleven focused work packages, with a total budget of 2 Million Euro. The project runs until October 1, 2013 and is bringing together a broad representation from the European fusion community with 36 participants from 18 countries, of which 22 Universities and 14 Euratom Associations.

The project consists of four groups of coordination actions: the establishment and running of the FuseNet network; development of individual learning opportunities and common educational goals; development of educational materials and hands-on experiments; and funding of joint educational activities.

== The Association ==
The FuseNet Association is an independent legal entity that was founded in December 2010 to form the sustainable continuation of the activities started by the equally named FuseNet project. The association provides a platform for the coordination of European fusion education activities, the initiation, development and implementation of new EU-wide actions, and for the exchange and dissemination of fusion education information. All European organizations that are active in the field of fusion education and research are welcome to join the association.
FuseNet is the umbrella organization and single voice for the training and education of the next generation fusion engineers and scientists. FuseNet is recognized as such by the European Commission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5688">[[File:International Network of Geoparks map.jpg|thumb|World locator map for geoparks included in the [[UNESCO]] [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) as of 2008]]
A '''geopark''' is a unified area that advances the protection and use of geological heritage in a sustainable way, and promotes the economic well-being of the people who live there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas_Zouros/publication/258100065_Geoparks_Celebrating_earth_heritage_sustaining_local_communities/links/0deec5272cb8fee05e000000.pdf Patrick J. Mc Keever and Nickolas Zouros (2005). Geoparks: Celebrating earth heritage, sustaining local communities. EPISODES, December 2005, pp. 274–278.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are global geoparks and national geoparks.

==Concepts==
A UNESCO definition of ''global geopark'' is a unified area with a geological heritage of international significance.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/global-geoparks/some-questions-about-geoparks/what-is-a-global-geopark/ |title=What is a Global Geopark? &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological [[hazard]]s, including [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s and many help prepare [[disaster]] mitigation strategies with [[Local community|local communities]]. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current [[climate change]]s as well as demonstrating a "best practise" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of "[[green tourism]]". [[Tourism]] industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.

Geoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for [[natural resource]]s, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding [[Natural environment|environment]] while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the [[landscape]]. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark" /&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of the concept of geopark and tourism promotion in geoparks differentiates itself from other models of [[sustainable tourism]]. In fact, sustainable tourism promotion within geoparks encompasses many of the features of sustainable tourism including geo-tourism (geo-site tourism: as a basic factor), community-based tourism and integrated rural tourism (as a vital need), [[ecotourism]], and [[cultural heritage]] tourism.

==Global Network and UNESCO==
The [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) is supported by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). Many national geoparks and other local geoparks projects also exist which are not included in the Global Geoparks Network.

The geoparks initiative was launched by UNESCO in response to the perceived need for an international initiative that recognizes sites representing an [[earth science]] interest.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About—UNESCO's role in geopark initiative |url=http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |publisher=Geopark Iskar Panega |year=2007 |work=Geopark Iskar Panega website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025602/http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |archivedate=2014-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Geoparks Network  aims at enhancing the value of such sites while at the same time creating [[employment]] and promoting regional [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt; The Global Geoparks Network works in synergy with UNESCO's [[World Heritage]] Centre and [[Man and the Biosphere]] (MAB) World Network of Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt;

===Qualification===
The Global Geoparks Network (GGN) is a UNESCO activity established in 1998. According to UNESCO, for a geopark to apply to be included in the GGN, it needs to:

* have a management plan designed to foster socio-economic development that is [[sustainable]] based on [[geotourism]]
* demonstrate methods for conserving and enhancing geological heritage and provide means for teaching geoscientific disciplines and broader environmental issues
* have joint proposals submitted by public authorities, local communities and private interests acting together, which demonstrate the best practices with respect to Earth heritage conservation and its integration into [[sustainable development]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;'April 2010 GEO4B/PM Advanced Level Examination - Advanced Information Booklet'&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 winners==

Shree Bose, a 17-year-old girl in Texas, won the grand prize and $50,000 for her research on the chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, that is commonly taken by women with ovarian cancer, tackling the problem of cancer cells growing resistant to cisplatin over time.

Naomi Shah of Portland, OR, won the age 15–16 category with a study of the effects of air quality on lungs, particularly for people who have asthma. Ms. Shah recruited 103 test subjects, performed 24-hour air quality measurements at their homes and workplaces and had each blow into a device that measured the force of their breath.

Lauren Hodge of York, PA, won the age 13–14 category for research on whether marinades reduce the amount of cancer-causing compounds produced by the grilling of [[meat]]. She found that [[lemon juice]] and brown sugar cut the level of carcinogens sharply, while [[soy sauce]] increased them.

People around the world (90 countries) had the opportunity to vote for their favorite projects in Google’s online voting gallery. Google has had more than 100,000 votes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/votes-are-in-for-google-science-fair.html |title= The Votes Are in for the Google Science Fair Finalists and People’s Choice Award Winner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the competition was really tight.

==2013==
The winners of the 2013 Google Science Fair were:

13-14 age category: Viney Kumar (Australia) — The PART (Police and Ambulances Regulating Traffic) Program. Viney’s project looked for new ways to provide drivers with more notice when an emergency vehicle is approaching, so they can take evasive action to get out of the emergency vehicle’s way.

15-16 age category: [[Ann Makosinski]] (Canada) — The Hollow Flashlight. Using Peltier tiles and the temperature difference between the palm of the hand and ambient air, Ann designed a flashlight that provides bright light without batteries or moving parts.

17-18 age category Grand Prize Winner: Eric Chen (USA) — Computer-aided Discovery of Novel Influenza Endonuclease Inhibitors to Combat Flu Pandemic. Combining computer modeling and biological studies, Eric’s project looks at influenza endonuclease inhibitors as leads for a new type of anti-flu medicine, effective against all influenza viruses including pandemic strains.

==2014==
The 2014 Google Science Fair started accepting entries on February 12, 2014 and the entries closed on May 13, 2014. And the results for the local, regional and Science in Action award nominees were declared. The Grand Prize was won by three girls from Ireland, [[Ciara Judge]] (16), Emer Hickey (16) and Sophie Healey (17). They were the first group winners of the competition and the youngest winners to date (they also won the 15-16 age category prize). Their project was entitled 'Combating the Global Food Crisis: Diazatroph Bacteria as a Cereal Crop Growth Promoter.'

The 13-14 age category was won by Mihir Garimella (14) from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a project titled 'Fruit-fly Inspired Robots.' Hayley Todesco (17) of Canada won the 17-18 age category with her project titled 'Cleaning up Oil Sands Waste.'

Along with the overall prizes for each category, a number of special awards were also announced. Kenneth Shinozuka (15) was declared as the Science In Action Award winner in recognition of the practical potential of his project 'Wearable Sensors for Aging Society.' [[Arsh Shah Dilbagi]] (16) from India won the Voter's Choice Award for creating an [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) device that converts breath into words, enabling mute people to speak.&lt;ref name="googlesciencefair.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/competition/previous-years|title=Previous Years - Google Science Fair|author=|date=|website=www.googlesciencefair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015==

The 2015 Google Science Fair closed for entries on May 18, 2015 with regional finalists announced in London on July 7, 2015. These included Lauren McKenzie (14) who built an automatic soil watering system, Shadab Karnachi (14) who designed a low-cost gaming device for people with visual impairments and Peter He (14) who developed an innovative wireless virtual reality system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing the Google Science Fair 2015 90 Regional Finalists!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7ivJch_7BE|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global finalists were announced on August 4, 2015 and the winners on September 21, 2015. The Grand Prize was won by [[Olivia Hallisey]] (16) with her project ‘Temperature-Independent, Portable, and Rapid Field Detection of Ebola via a Silk-Derived Lateral-Flow System’.  The Google Technologist Award was won by Girish Kumar (17) for his project ‘Revup: Automatically Generating Questions from Educational Texts’ and the Incubator Award was won by Elliott Sarrey (14) with his project ‘Bot2karot: Manage Your Vegetable Garden via Your Smartphone’. The Lego Education Builder Award won by Anurudh Ganesan (15), the Virgin Galactic Pioneer Award won by Jeff Cheema (15), the Scientific American Innovator Award won by Krtin Nithiyanandam (15), the National Geographic Explorer Award won by Deepika Kurup (17) and the Community Impact Award won by Lalita Prasida.&lt;ref name="googlesciencefair.com"/&gt;

==2016==

The 2016 Google Science Fair closed its entries on May 17, 2016, the Global 16 Finalist were announced on August 11, 2016. The final event took place during 24 to 27 September 2016 at Mountain View, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Science Fair Awards Show 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZSmqjtgkmo|website=You Tube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen finalists competed for top five awards. The first two rounds had two age groups 13-15 and 16-18. However, unlike previous years, top awards during the finalist event did not distinguish between the two age groups of the previous rounds, thus making it particularly challenging event for the contestant compared to all previous years.

The Grand Prize was won by [[Kiara Nirghin]] (16) of South Africa for her project 'Fighting Drought with Fruit'.&lt;ref&gt;'{{cite web|title= Combatting drought with a Low-Cost, biodegradable Superabsorbent Polymer made out of Orange Peels|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/deb654bce83b15eed364f52fa8685634649014602eca78858c58fec00aa6041a|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lego Education Builder award was won by Anushka Naiknaware (13) of United States, the youngest contestant to win a top award ever, for 'Smart Wound Care for the Future'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fractal inspired Chitosan and Carbon Nanoparticle Based Biocompatible Sensor for Wound Management|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/562f25503d252660ac0e8309b7711f3fc2ef084c0fa3598a7a7cf9377fc8adaa|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Geographic Explorer award was won by Mphatso Simbao (18) of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheap production of nitrogen pesticides and fertilizers through hydrolysis of plant protein for rural use|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/ae920a381dfc15613b9d8f530d904301ef5b23158fd60c5dc33af8d7a6d98d98|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scientific American Innovator Award was won by a team of three for 'Fighting Foam Waste with Recycled Filters' from the US [Ashton (14), Luke (14) and Julia (14)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">There are a large number of [[hardness]] testing methods available (e.g. [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]], [[Brinell scale|Brinell]], [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Meyer hardness test|Meyer]] and [[Leeb rebound hardness test|Leeb]]). Although it is impossible in many cases to give an exact conversion, it is possible to give an approximate material-specific comparison table e.g. for [[steel]]s.

In [[applied mathematics]], '''highly optimized tolerance (HOT)''' is a method of generating [[power law]] behavior in systems by including a [[global optimization]] principle.  For some systems that display a characteristic scale, a global optimization term could potentially be added that would then yield power law behavior.  It has been used to generate and describe internet-like graphs, [[forest fire]] models and may also apply to biological systems.

==Example==
The following is taken from Sornette's book.

Consider a [[random variable]], &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, that takes on values &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthmore, lets assume for another parameter &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_i = r_i^{ - \beta }&lt;/math&gt;
for some fixed &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  We then want to minimize
:&lt;math&gt; L = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} p_i x_i &lt;/math&gt;
subject to the constraint
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_i = \kappa &lt;/math&gt;
Using [[Lagrange multipliers]], this gives
:&lt;math&gt; p_i \propto x_i^{ - ( 1 + 1/ \beta) } &lt;/math&gt;
giving us a power law.  The global optimization of minimizing the energy along with the power law dependence between &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; gives us a power law distribution in probability.

An '''ignition tube''' is a piece of [[laboratory]] equipment.  It is a [[laboratory tube]] used much in the same way as a [[boiling tube]] except not being as large and thick-walled.  It is primarily used to hold small quantities of substances which are undergoing direct heating by a [[Bunsen burner]] or other heat source. 

Ignition tubes are used in the [[sodium fusion test]].

Ignition tubes are often difficult to clean due to the small bore. When used to heat substances strongly, some char may stick to the walls as well. They are usually disposable.

The '''Institute for Science and Society (ISS)''' was an international centre of excellence{{clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what is a centre of excellence}} in [[Science and Technology Studies]] located at the [[University of Nottingham]], [[UK]].

== History ==

It was founded in 1998 as the Genetics and Society Unit (GSU) and was later (2001) renamed the Institute for the Study of Genetics, Biorisks and Society (IGBiS) before its remit was expanded in 2006 to cover the social, legal, ethical and cultural implications of any field of science, medicine or technology, at which point it became ISS. The Institute was restructured in 2010 and mostly merged into the School of Sociology and Social Policy.

== About ISS ==

The Institute for Science and Society was a multidisciplinary centre drawing on a wide range of social sciences and humanities disciplines to conduct research into cutting edge aspects of the mutual relationship between science and society.{{clarify|date=May 2013}} Historically{{clarify|date=May 2013}}, the Institute's agenda was dominated by topics in the bio-sciences, broadly conceived, but it became increasingly involved in partnerships around physical science issues like nanotechnology, sustainable energy use and climate change.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} 

The Institute is now physically part of the School of Sociology and Social Policy at the University of Nottingham, but works virtually across the University under the University's Priority Group scheme as the Science and Technology Studies Priority Group.

Since its foundation, the Institute has been variously supported by grants and contracts from the [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] and [[Wellcome Trust]]s, the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC), the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC), the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC), the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), The [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC), the [[European Union]] and the [[National Health Service]] (NHS).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Dr. Sujatha Raman and Professor Brigitte Nerlich are the current co-directors of the Institute.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22497">[[Image:Inverse square law.svg|thumb|420px|S represents the light source, while r represents the measured points. The lines represent the [[flux]] emanating from the sources and fluxes.
 
The total number of [[flux line]]s depends on the strength of the source and is constant with increasing distance, where a greater density of flux lines (lines per unit area) means a stronger field. The density of flux lines is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source because the surface area of a sphere increases with the square of the radius. Thus the strength of the field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.]]

The '''inverse-square law''', in [[physics]], is any [[physical law]] stating that a specified physical [[quantity]] or intensity is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[distance]] from the source of that physical quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space (see diagram).

[[Radar]] energy expands during both the signal transmission and also on the [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] return, so the [[inverse square]] for both paths means that the radar will receive energy according to the inverse [[fourth power]] of the range.

In order to prevent dilution of [[energy]] while propagating a signal, certain methods can be used such as a [[waveguide]], which acts like a canal does for water, or how a gun barrel restricts hot gas expansion to one [[dimension]] in order to prevent loss of energy transfer to a [[bullet]].

== Formula ==
Mathematically notated (see [[∝]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\text{intensity} \ \propto \ \frac{1}{\text{distance}^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

It can also be mathematically expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{intensity}_1}{\text{intensity}_2} = \frac{\text{distance}_2^2}{\text{distance}_1^2}&lt;/math&gt;

or as the formulation of a constant quantity:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{intensity}_1 \times \text{distance}_1^2 = \text{intensity}_2 \times \text{distance}_2^2&lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] which is the resultant of radial inverse-square law fields with respect to one or more sources is everywhere proportional to the strength of the local sources, and hence zero outside sources. [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] follows an inverse-square law, as do the effects of [[electricity|electric]], [[magnetism|magnetic]], [[light]], [[sound]], and [[radiation]] phenomena.

== Justification ==
The inverse-square law generally applies when some force, energy, or [[flux|other conserved quantity]] is evenly radiated outward from a [[point source]] in [[three-dimensional space]].  Since the [[surface area]] of a [[sphere]] (which is&amp;nbsp;4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;) is proportional to the square of the radius, as the [[flux density|emitted radiation]] gets farther from the source, it is spread out over an area that is increasing in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Hence, the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area (directly facing the point source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source. [[Gauss's law]] is similarly applicable, and can be used with any physical quantity that acts in accordance with the inverse-square relationship.

==Occurrences==

===Gravitation===
[[Gravity|Gravitation]] is the attraction between objects that have mass. Newton's law states:
: ''The gravitational attraction force between two '''point masses''' is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force is always attractive and acts along the line joining them.''

If the distribution of matter in each body is spherically symmetric, then the objects can be treated as point masses without approximation, as shown in the [[shell theorem]].  Otherwise, if we want to calculate the attraction between massive bodies, we need to add all the point-point attraction forces vectorially and the net attraction might not be exact inverse square. However, if the separation between the massive bodies is much larger compared to their sizes, then to a good approximation, it is reasonable to treat the masses as a point mass located at the object's [[center of mass]] while calculating the gravitational force.

As the law of gravitation, this [[Law of universal gravitation|law]] was suggested in 1645 by [[Ismael Bullialdus]]. But Bullialdus did not accept [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler’s second and third laws]], nor did he appreciate [[Christiaan Huygens]]’s solution for circular motion (motion in a straight line pulled aside by the central force).  Indeed, Bullialdus maintained the sun's force was attractive at aphelion and repulsive at perihelion. [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]] both expounded gravitation in 1666 as an attractive force&lt;ref&gt;Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses: See page 239 in Curtis Wilson (1989), "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", ch.13 (pages 233–274) in "Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics: 2A: Tycho Brahe to Newton", CUP 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke’s lecture "On gravity" at the Royal Society, London, on 21 March;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Birch, ''The History of the Royal Society of London'', … (London, England:  1756), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 68–73]; see especially pages 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Borelli's "Theory of the Planets", published later in 1666&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZk_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Theoricae Mediceorum Planetarum ex Causius Physicis Deductae''] [Theory [of the motion] of the Medicean planets [i.e., moons of Jupiter] deduced from physical causes] (Florence, (Italy):  1666).&lt;/ref&gt;).  Hooke's 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to "all celestiall bodys" and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines. By 1679, Hooke thought gravitation had inverse square dependence and communicated this in a letter to [[Isaac Newton]]:&lt;ref name=Hooke1680&gt;{{cite journal |author = Koyré, Alexandre |authorlink = Alexandre Koyré |title = An Unpublished Letter of Robert Hooke to Isaac Newton |journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |year = 1952 |volume = 43 |issue = 4 |pages = 312–337 |jstor = 227384 |doi = 10.1086/348155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''my supposition is that the attraction always is in duplicate proportion to the distance from the center reciprocall''.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke's letter to Newton of 6 Jan. 1680 (Koyré 1952:332).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke remained bitter about Newton claiming the invention of this principle, even though Newton's 1686 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' acknowledged that Hooke, along with Wren and Halley, had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system,&lt;ref&gt;Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1 (in all editions): See for example the 1729 English translation of the ''Principia'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false at page 66].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as giving some credit to Bullialdus.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to Edmund Halley dated June 20, 1686, Newton wrote:  "Bullialdus wrote that all force respecting ye Sun as its center &amp; depending on matter must be reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of ye distance from ye center."  See:   I. Bernard Cohen and George E. Smith, ed.s, ''The Cambridge Companion to Newton'' (Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3wIzvqzfUXkC&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 204].
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrostatics===
The force of attraction or repulsion between two electrically charged particles, in addition to being directly proportional to the product of the electric charges, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them; this is known as [[Coulomb's law]]. The deviation of the exponent from 2 is less than one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Williams, Faller, Hill |title = New Experimental Test of Coulomb's Law: A Laboratory Upper Limit on the Photon Rest Mass |journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] |volume = 26 |issue = 12 |pages = 721–724 |year = 1971 |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.26.721 |first1 = E. |last2 = Faller |first2 = J. |last3 = Hill |first3 = H. |bibcode = 1971PhRvL..26..721W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light and other electromagnetic radiation===

The [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] (or [[illuminance]] or [[irradiance]]) of [[light]] or other linear waves radiating from a [[point source]] (energy per unit of area perpendicular to the source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source; so an object (of the same size) twice as far away, receives only one-quarter the [[energy]] (in the same time period).

More generally, the irradiance, ''i.e.,'' the intensity (or [[power (physics)|power]] per unit area in the direction of [[wave propagation|propagation]]), of a [[sphere|spherical]] [[wavefront]] varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source (assuming there are no losses caused by [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] or [[scattering]]).

For example, the intensity of radiation from the [[Sun]] is 9126 [[watt]]s per square meter at the distance of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (0.387 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]); but only 1367 watts per square meter at the distance of [[Earth]] (1 AU)—an approximate threefold increase in distance results in an approximate ninefold decrease in intensity of radiation.

For non-[[isotropic radiator]]s such as [[parabolic antenna]]s, headlights, and [[laser]]s, the effective origin is located far behind the beam aperture. If you are close to the origin, you don't have to go far to double the radius, so the signal drops quickly. When you are far from the origin and still have a strong signal, like with a laser, you have to travel very far to double the radius and reduce the signal. This means you have a stronger signal or have [[antenna gain]] in the direction of the narrow beam relative to a wide beam in all directions of an [[Isotropic radiator|isotropic antenna]].

In [[photography]] and [[stage lighting]], the inverse-square law is used to determine the "fall off" or the difference in illumination on a subject as it moves closer to or further from the light source. For quick approximations, it is enough to remember that doubling the distance reduces illumination to one quarter;&lt;ref&gt;Millerson,G. (1991) ''Lighting for Film and Television – 3rd Edition'' p.27&lt;/ref&gt; or similarly, to halve the illumination increase the distance by a factor of 1.4 (the [[square root of 2]]), and to double illumination, reduce the distance to 0.7 (square root of 1/2). When the illuminant is not a point source, the inverse square rule is often still a useful approximation; when the size of the light source is less than one-fifth of the distance to the subject, the calculation error is less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Ryer,A. (1997) "The Light Measurement Handbook", {{ISBN|0-9658356-9-3}} p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

The fractional reduction in electromagnetic [[fluence]] (Φ) for indirectly ionizing radiation with increasing distance from a point source can be calculated using the inverse-square law. Since emissions from a point source have radial directions, they intercept at a perpendicular incidence. The area of such a shell is 4π''r'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''r'' is the radial distance from the center.  The law is particularly important in diagnostic [[radiography]] and [[radiotherapy]] treatment planning, though this proportionality does not hold in practical situations unless source dimensions are much smaller than the distance.  As stated in fourier theory of heat "as the point source is magnification by distances , its radiation is dilute proportional to  the sin of the angle, of the increasing circumference arc from the point of origin"

====Example====

Let the total power radiated from a point source, for example, an omnidirectional [[isotropic radiator]], be&amp;nbsp;''P''. At large distances from the source (compared to the size of the source), this power is distributed over larger and larger spherical surfaces as the distance from the source increases.  Since the surface area of a sphere of radius ''r'' is ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4''πr''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] ''I'' (power per unit area) of radiation at distance ''r'' is
:&lt;math&gt;
I = \frac P A = \frac P {4 \pi r^2}. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The energy or intensity decreases (divided by&amp;nbsp;4) as the distance ''r'' is doubled; measured in [[Decibel|dB]] it would decrease by 6.02&amp;nbsp;dB per doubling of distance.

===Sound in a gas===

In [[acoustics]], the [[sound pressure]] of a [[sphere|spherical]] [[wavefront]] radiating from a point source decreases by 50% as the distance ''r'' is doubled; measured in [[Decibel|dB]], the decrease is still 6.02&amp;nbsp;dB, since dB represents an intensity ratio. The pressure ratio (as opposed to power ratio) is not inverse-square, but is inverse-proportional (inverse distance law):

:&lt;math&gt; p \ \propto \ \frac{1}{r} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The same is true for the component of [[particle velocity]] &lt;math&gt; v \,&lt;/math&gt; that is [[Phase (waves)#In-phase and quadrature (I&amp;Q) components|in-phase]] with the instantaneous sound pressure &lt;math&gt;p \,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; v \ \propto \frac{1}{r} \ \, &lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Near and far field|near field]] is a [[quadrature phase|quadrature component]] of the particle velocity that is 90° out of phase with the sound pressure and does not contribute to the time-averaged energy or the intensity of the sound.  The [[sound intensity]] is the product of the [[root mean square|RMS]] sound pressure and the ''in-phase'' component of the RMS particle velocity, both of which are inverse-proportional. Accordingly, the intensity follows an inverse-square behaviour:

:&lt;math&gt; I \ = \ p v \ \propto \ \frac{1}{r^2}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Field theory interpretation==
For an [[irrotational vector field]] in three-dimensional space, the inverse-square law corresponds to the property that the [[divergence]] is zero outside the source. This can be generalized to higher dimensions. Generally, for an irrotational vector field in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the intensity "I" of the vector field falls off with the distance "r" following the inverse (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power law

: &lt;math&gt;I\propto \frac 1 {r^{n-1}},&lt;/math&gt;

given that the space outside the source is divergence free. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==History==

[[John Dumbleton]] of the 14th-century [[Oxford Calculators]], was one of the first to express functional relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the [[mean speed theorem]] stating that "the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint" and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination  in his ''Summa logicæ et philosophiæ naturalis'' (ca. 1349), stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the Inverse-square law.&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, ''Before Galileo: The Birth of Modern Science in Medieval Europe'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In proposition 9 of Book 1 in his book ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena, quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur'' (1604), the astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] argued that the spreading of light from a point source obeys an inverse square law:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena, quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur'' (Frankfurt, (Germany):   Claude de Marne &amp; heir Jean Aubry, 1604), [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00007828/images/index.html?id=00007828&amp;fip=eayaxsewqxsfsdreayasdasxdsydeayaxsewq&amp;no=32&amp;seite=30 page 10.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation of the Latin quote from Kepler's ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena'' is from:  Gal, O. &amp; Chen-Morris, R.(2005) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2005HisSc..43..391G/0000398.000.html "The Archaeology of the Inverse Square Law: (1) Metaphysical Images and Mathematical Practices,"] ''History of Science'', '''43''' :   391–414 ; see especially p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Original:  ''Sicut se habent spharicae superificies, quibus origo lucis pro centro est, amplior ad angustiorem:  ita se habet fortitudo seu densitas lucis radiorum in angustiori, ad illamin in laxiori sphaerica, hoc est, conversim.  Nam per 6. 7. tantundem lucis est in angustiori sphaerica superficie, quantum in fusiore, tanto ergo illie stipatior &amp; densior quam hic.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Translation'':  Just as [the ratio of] spherical surfaces, for which the source of light is the center, [is] from the wider to the narrower, so the density or fortitude of the rays of light in the narrower [space], towards the more spacious spherical surfaces, that is, inversely.  For according to [propositions] 6 &amp; 7, there is as much light in the narrower spherical surface, as in the wider, thus it is as much more compressed and dense here than there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1645 in his book ''Astronomia Philolaica'' …, the French astronomer [[Ismaël Bullialdus]] (1605 – 1694) refuted Johannes Kepler's suggestion that "gravity"&lt;ref&gt;Note:  Kepler's notion of "gravity" was not the modern notion:  Kepler believed that the Sun exerted a force on the planets which propelled them in their orbits around the Sun.  Like beams of light from a light house, this force rotated with the Sun as it turned.&lt;/ref&gt; weakens as the inverse of the distance; instead, Bullialdus argued, "gravity" weakens as the inverse square of the distance:&lt;ref&gt;Ismail Bullialdus, ''Astronomia Philolaica'' … (Paris, France:  Piget, 1645), [http://diglib.hab.de/drucke/2-1-4-astron-2f-1/start.htm?image=00005 page 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation of the Latin quote from Bullialdus' ''Astronomia Philolaica'' … is from: O'Connor, John J. and Roberson, Edmund F.  (2006)  [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Boulliau.html "Ismael Boulliau"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130062658/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Boulliau.html |date=30 November 2016 }}, The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive,  School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Saint Andrews, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Original:  ''Virtus autem illa, qua Sol prehendit seu harpagat planetas, corporalis quae ipsi pro manibus est, lineis rectis in omnem mundi amplitudinem emissa quasi species solis cum illius corpore rotatur:  cum ergo sit corporalis imminuitur, &amp; extenuatur in maiori spatio &amp; intervallo, ratio autem huius imminutionis eadem est, ac luminus, in ratione nempe dupla intervallorum, sed eversa.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Translation'':  As for the power by which the Sun seizes or holds the planets, and which, being corporeal, functions in the manner of hands, it is emitted in straight lines throughout the whole extent of the world, and like the species of the Sun, it turns with the body of the Sun; now, seeing that it is corporeal, it becomes weaker and attenuated at a greater distance or interval, and the ratio of its decrease in strength is the same as in the case of light, namely, the duplicate proportion, but inversely, of the distances [that is, 1/d²].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England, the Anglican bishop [[Seth Ward (bishop of Salisbury)|Seth Ward]] (1617 – 1689) publicized the ideas of Bullialdus in his critique ''In Ismaelis Bullialdi astronomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis'' (1653) and publicized the planetary astronomy of Kepler in his book ''Astronomia geometrica'' (1656).

In 1663–1664, the English scientist [[Robert Hooke]] was writing his book ''Micrographia'' (1666) in which he discussed, among other things, the relation between the height of the atmosphere and the barometric pressure at the surface.  Since the atmosphere surrounds the earth, which itself is a sphere, the volume of atmosphere bearing on any unit area of the earth's surface is a truncated cone (which extends from the earth's center to the vacuum of space; obviously only the section of the cone from the earth's surface to space bears on the earth's surface).  Although the volume of a cone is proportional to the cube of its height, Hooke argued that the air's pressure at the earth's surface is instead proportional to the height of the atmosphere because gravity diminishes with altitude.  Although Hooke did not explicitly state so, the relation that he proposed would be true only if gravity decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the earth's center.&lt;ref&gt;(Gal &amp; Chen-Morris, 2005), pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hooke, ''Micrographia'' … (London, England:  John Martyn, 1667), [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=goto&amp;id=HistSciTech.HookeMicro&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=227 page 227:]  "[I say a ''Cylinder'', not a piece of a ''Cone'', because, as I may elsewhere shew in the Explication of Gravity, that ''triplicate'' proportion of the shels of a Sphere, to their respective diameters, I suppose to be removed in this case by the decrease of the power of Gravity.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iron stress repressed RNA''' (IsrR) is a cis-encoded [[antisense]] RNA which regulates the expression of the photosynthetic protein isiA. IsiA expression is activated by the [[Ferric uptake regulator family|Ferric uptake regulator protein]] (Fur) under [[iron]] stress conditions. IsiA enhances photosynthesis by forming a ring around [[photosystem I]] which acts as an additional antenna complex.&lt;ref name="pmid16636284"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dühring U, Axmann IM, Hess WR, Wilde A |title=An internal antisense RNA regulates expression of the photosynthesis gene isiA |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=18 |pages=7054–8 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16636284 |pmc=1459017 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600927103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IsrR is abundant when there is a sufficient iron concentration. IsrR is encoded for within the opposite stand of isiA gene and contains a conserved [[stem loop]] secondary structure. Under sufficient iron conditions IsrR binds to its complementary region which corresponds to the central third of the isiA [[mRNA]]. The resulting duplex RNA is then targeted for degradation. This allows the antisense RNA to act as a reversible switch that responds to changes in environmental conditions to modulate the expression of the isiA protein.

IsrR was originally identified within cyanobacteria but may be conserved throughout a number of photosynthetic species from multiple kingdoms. At present, IsrR is the only non coding RNA identified that has a regulatory role on photosynthetic proteins.

'''John E. Penick''' is an American professor of [[science education]] who has taught in high schools, community college, and at several universities in the United States and abroad. Author of more than 200 articles in professional journals and 40 books and monographs, Penick is best known for promoting innovative programs and processes for enhancing undergraduate teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;Yager, R. E. and Penick, J. E. (1990). Science education. Chapter 36 of Houston, R. E. (Ed.) Handbook of Research on Teacher Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiiBmQ0bQGg |title=IT'S ABOUT TIME® Interviews Dr. John Penick at NSTA 2014 |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-04-11 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his innovations were based on his studies of exemplary teachers in the United States, studies that focused on determining the roles of effective teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E., Yager, R. E., and Bonnstetter, R. (October, 1986). Teachers make exemplary programs. Educational Leadership, 44(2), 14-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work with undergraduates, Penick has conducted workshops and presentations for teachers in almost every state of the U.S., speaking about and demonstrating how research can inform teacher practice and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J.E. and Harris, R.L. (2005). Teaching with Purpose. Arlington VA: NSTA Press. 66 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Widening his scope, Penick has worked extensively with a variety of international universities, ministries of education, and organizations in 35 countries.

==Education==
Penick received his B.S. in zoology and chemistry (1966) and his M.A. in biology education (1969) from the [[University of Miami]].  He received his Ph.D. in Science Education from [[The Florida State University]] in 1973. At Florida State he was mentored by Professor Dorothy M. Schlitt, known for her innovative ideas related to science teacher education. At Florida State, Penick was also significantly influenced by Professors Charles Matthews and Ron Good. While at Florida State Penick met fellow student [[James A. Shymansky]], with whom he would continue to work for many years.

==Professional career==
Following his graduation in 1973, Penick became assistant professor at [[Loyola University of Chicago]], where he taught and was Director of Teacher Education in his second year. In 1975 Penick left Loyola for the [[University of Iowa]], where his classmate, [[James A. Shymansky]], had been for two years. At Iowa, Penick was promoted to Associate Professor (1977) and Professor (1982) and eventually was named Department Chair (1982).  While at Iowa, Penick worked closely with Vincent Lunetta in developing and expanding a preservice science teacher education program, initially funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], called Iowa UPSTEP.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E. and Lunetta, V. N. (Autumn, 1980). Iowa-UPSTEP: A dynamic model in science teacher education now. The Teacher Educator, 16(1), 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E. and Yager, R. E. (Nov–Dec, 1988) Science teacher education: A program with a theoretical and pragmatic rationale. Journal of Teacher Education, 39(6), 59–64&lt;/ref&gt; During Penick’s years at the University of Iowa, the department of science education was noted as being large, dynamic, and highly productive of scholarly publications and outstanding students at every level. In 1985 he was a senior [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] Scholar at the [[University of Lisbon]] (Portugal) and [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|The Technion]] ([[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]]).

After more than 22 years at the University of Iowa, Penick was named Head of the Department of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education at [[North Carolina State University]]. As Department Head, Penick emphasized research productivity and hired a number of new faculty members. During his more than 10 years as Head, the value of grants obtained by his department grew significantly and his department grew in research productivity.

Following his retirement from NC State in 2009, Penick accepted a position as Director for Research and Development at [[Sangari do Brasil]], in Sao Paulo Brazil. With the creation of Sangari USA, Penick became vice president for research and development of the American subsidiary. He retired from Sangari in 2011 and currently resides in Miami Florida.

==Honors and offices==
Active academically, Penick has been or is on the editorial boards of a number of journals. Penick has received formal recognition from a number of groups, including the [[Association for Science Teacher Education]] (ASTE), which has presented him with its Outstanding Research award (1976, with [[James A. Shymansky]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theaste.org/awards/past-award-winners/#a5 |title=Past Award Winners |website=Theaste.org |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outstanding Mentor award (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theaste.org/awards/past-award-winners/#a2 |title=Past Award Winners |website=Theaste.org |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named him Outstanding Science Educator in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theaste.org/awards/past-award-winners/ |title=Past Award Winners |website=Theaste.org |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penick was elected president of ASTE in 2002-2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theaste.org/about/history/past-presidents/ |title=Past Presidents |website=Theaste.org |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), of which he was president in 2003-2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsta.org/conferences/schedule.aspx?id=2014bos&amp;action=search&amp;format=Featured%20Speaker |title=National Science Teachers Association |website=Nsta.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; awarded him with several awards before naming him to receive the Robert H. Carleton award, its highest honor, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsta.org/about/pressroom.aspx?id=59956 |title=NSTA Pressroom |website=Nsta.org |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of the [[National Association of Biology Teachers]] in 1989, he has also received its highest award, Honorary Membership. [[Epsilon Pi Tau]], the national honorary for technology education presented Penick with a Distinguished Service Citation in 2003 for his contributions to technology education.  In 1987 and again in 2015, the [[Florida State University College of Education]] presented him with the Distinguished Educator award, its highest award, for his contributions to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.fsu.edu/alumni-and-friends/distinguished-alumni/past-recipients |title=Past Recipients &amp;#124; College of Education - FSU |website=Education.fsu.edu |date=2015-11-10 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=) |url=http://fsuednews.com/2015/10/19/fsu-college-of-education-names-2015-distinguished-alumni-award-winners/ |title=FSU College of Education names 2015 Distinguished Alumni Award winners |website=FSU EdNews |date=2015-10-19 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born while his father, Edgar C. Penick Jr., was stationed at Langley Virginia during WW II,  young John lived in Austin Texas prior to his family moving to Miami Florida in 1947, where, like many others, he dreamed of being the undersea explorer, Jacques Cousteau. After earning his B.S., Penick finished a year of graduate work there in Zoology before becoming a high school biology and chemistry teacher at [[Miami Jackson High School|Miami Jackson Senior High School]]. After his masters degree, Penick taught one summer at [[Miami Dade College|Miami-Dade Community College]] before being named department head at Miami Jackson. During the 1972-73 school year, he taught  high school biology at the Florida State University lab school, with Professor Dorothy Schlitt, Sharyl Bender, and Judy Lewis . A 1978 article describes the innovations they implemented during that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Student-structured learning in biology.|last = Penick, J. E., Schlitt, D., Bender, S., and Lewis, J.|first = |date = 1975|journal = Science Education|volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=13-18|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Penick married his high school sweetheart, Nell Inman in 1966 and, after she taught English at Jackson High School for three years, they had two children, Lucas (1969) and Megan (1973).  Nell Inman Penick received her Ph.D. in Counseling and Human Development from the University of Iowa in 1990 and had a private practice for [[marriage and family therapy]] for 20 years in Iowa and North Carolina, Lucas is a private teacher and tutor, primarily in science and mathematics, in Miami and Megan is an attorney in New York City. Megan, with her husband, Yong Jae Lee, has given her parents three grandchildren, Juliet Lee (2006), Renee Lee (2008), and Lia Lee (2010).

'''Juice fasting''', also known as '''juice cleansing''', is a [[fad diet]] in which a person consumes only [[fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]]s while abstaining from solid food consumption. It is used for [[detoxification (alternative medicine)|detoxification]], an [[alternative medicine]] treatment, and is often part of [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)#Detox diets|detox diets]]. The diet can typically last for two to seven days and involve a number of fruits and vegetables and even spices that are not among the juices typically sold or consumed in the average Western diet. 

This diet is sometimes promoted with implausible and unsubstantiated claims about its [[Health benefit (medicine)|health benefits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Do Juice Cleanses Work? 10 Truths About The Fad |date=27 May 2015 |publisher=Huffington Post |author=Valiant, Melissa |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/22/do-juice-cleanses-work_n_1372305.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Catherine Collins, chief dietician of [[St George's, University of London|St George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, England, states that: "The concept of ‘[[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|detox]]’ is a marketing myth rather than a physiological entity. The idea that an avalanche of vitamins, minerals, and laxatives taken over a 2 to 7 day period can have a long-lasting benefit for the body is also a marketing myth."&lt;ref name="senseaboutscience.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/debunking-detox.html Debunking detox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418091439/http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/debunking-detox.html |date=2014-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detox diets, depending on the type and duration, are potentially dangerous and can cause various health problems including muscle loss and an unhealthy regaining of fat after the detox ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/detox-diets-purging-myths The Truth About Detox Diets]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46776">The survival of some [[microorganisms]] exposed to [[outer space]] has been studied using both simulated facilities and [[low Earth orbit]] exposures. Bacteria were some of the first organisms investigated, when in 1960 a Russian satellite carried ''Escherichia coli'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Enterobacter aerogenes'' into orbit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.indy100.com/article/bacteria-get-dangerously-weird-in-space-7380481| title=Bacteria get dangerously weird in space| last=Love| first=Shayla|date=2016-10-26| newspaper=The Independent| access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments since, as listed in the table below.

Experiments of the adaption of microbes in space have yielded unpredictable results. While sometimes the microorganism may weaken, they can also increase in their disease-causing potency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is possible to classify these microorganisms into two groups, the [[Medical microbiology|human-borne]], and the [[extremophiles]]. Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future [[Human spaceflight|crewed missions in space]], whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in space.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'&gt;

Extremophiles have adapted to live in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. This includes [[hypersaline lake]]s, [[desert|arid regions]], [[deep sea]], acidic sites, cold and dry polar regions and [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of extremophiles has led to the speculation that microorganisms could survive the harsh conditions of extraterrestrial environments and be used as model organisms to understand the fate of biological systems in these environments. The focus of many of the experiments has been to investigate the possible survival of organisms inside rocks ([[lithopanspermia]]),&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt; or their survival on [[Mars]] for understanding the likelihood of past or present life on that planet.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt;  Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial [[spore]]s are considered likely potential [[Planetary protection|forward contaminants]] on robotic missions to [[Mars]].  Measuring the resistance of such organisms to space conditions can be applied to develop adequate decontamination procedures.&lt;ref&gt;

Research and testing of microorganisms in outer space could eventually be applied for [[directed panspermia]] or [[terraforming]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9461">'''Parson-naturalists''' were [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers of religion]] who also studied [[natural history]]. The archetypical [[parson-naturalist]] was a [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest in the Church of England]] in charge of a country parish, who saw the study of science as an [[Relationship between religion and science|extension of his religious work]]. The philosophy entailed the belief that God, as the Creator of all things, wanted man to understand his Creations and thus to study them through [[scientific technique]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; They often collected and preserved natural artefacts such as leaves, flowers, birds' eggs, birds, insects, and small mammals to classify and study. Some wrote books or kept nature diaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="109296">'''[[Scientific misconduct]]''' is the violation of the standard codes of [[scholarly method|scholarly conduct]] and [[ethics|ethical behavior]] in the publication of professional [[science|scientific research]].  A ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' review on ''Handling of Scientific Misconduct in Scandinavian countries'' gave examples of policy definitions. In Denmark, scientific misconduct is defined as "intention[al] or gross negligence leading to fabrication of the scientific message or a false credit or emphasis given to a scientist", and in Sweden as "intention[al] distortion of the research process by fabrication of data, text, hypothesis, or methods from another researcher's manuscript form or publication; or distortion of the research process in other ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nylenna M, Andersen D, Dahlquist G, Sarvas M, Aakvaag A | title = Handling of scientific dishonesty in the Nordic countries.

A 2009 [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] of survey data found that about 2% of scientists admitted to falsifying, fabricating, or modifying data at least once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fanelli D | title = How many scientists fabricate and falsify research?

'''Los Angeles Science Teachers Network''' is a professional development network for [[science education]] by science teachers for science teachers committed to creating the most engaging hands-on curriculum possible through [[inquiry-based learning]] and [[scientific literacy]].

==History==
The first meeting was held in [[Lisa Ellen Niver]]'s home in September 2009. In October 2013, the professional development network had its fifteenth session. Over seventy teachers and forty schools have been involved to date. In ''[[Westside Today]]'', information about teaching, science and LASTN was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Advisory Council==
Several teachers formed the core group and served as advisors to Niver over the first three years: Susan Bagdasarian, Sasha Moore, Joseph Rose and Judy Weiskopf. Niver was frequently asked about teaching science, she has been quoted in Parenting.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.parenting.com/gallery/everyday-ways-sneak-learning |title      =Everyday Ways to Sneak in Learning |work     =Parenting.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]].org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.pbs.org/parents/education/science/tips/weather-science-lessons/ |title      =Weather Science Lessons |work      = PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Green Living Arizona'' (in print),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.greenlivingaz.com/2012/05/08/5528/ |title      =Science vs. Nutrition the GMO debate |work      =Green Living Magazine Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Huffington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url        =  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/back-to-school-divorce-teachers_n_1761147.html?ir=Divorce#slide=1376638 |title      =Back to School 2012: Teachers Reveal Divorced Parents Biggest Mistakes |work     =  Huffington Post | date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on National television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqZqdq7Al24 |title      =Career Day |work     =National Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        = http://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/2012/08/success-story-science-fair-projects-with-real-world-impact.php |title      =  Success Story: Science Fair Projects with Real-World Impact |work      =Science Buddies}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Niver is on sabbatical with [[We Said Go Travel]], Susan Bagdasarian has been the director of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lisa-niver-rajna/0/871/6a3f |title      =LASTN |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/company/3148346?trk=tyah |title      =LASTN company |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1435">In the [[design of experiments]] and [[analysis of variance]], a '''main effect''' is the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable averaging across the levels of any other independent variables.  The term is frequently used in the context of [[factorial design]]s and [[regression analysis|regression models]] to distinguish main effects from [[interaction (statistics)|interaction]] effects.

Relative to a factorial design, under an analysis of variance, a main effect test will test the hypotheses expected such as H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the null hypothesis. Running a hypothesis for a main effect will test whether there is evidence of an effect of different treatments. However a main effect test is nonspecific and will not allow for a localization of specific mean pairwise comparisons (simple effects). A main effect test will merely look at whether overall there is something about a particular factor that is making a difference. In other words a test examining differences amongst the levels of a single factor (averaging over the other factor and/or factors). Main effects are essentially the overall effect of a factor.

'''Maker education''' (a term coined by [[Dale Dougherty]] in 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design, make, play: Growing the next generation of STEM innovators|last=Dougherty|first=Dale|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-0415539203|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely associated with [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] learning, is an approach to [[Problem-based learning|problem-based]] and [[project-based learning]] that relies upon hands-on, often collaborative, learning experiences as a method for solving authentic problems. People who participate in making often call themselves "makers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lifehacker.com/im-dale-dougherty-founder-of-make-magazine-and-this-i-1742793651|title=I'm Dale Dougherty, Founder of Make: Magazine, and This Is How I Work|last=Orin|first=Andy|newspaper=Lifehacker|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[maker movement]] and develop their projects in [[makerspace]]s, or development studios which emphasize prototyping and the repurposing of found objects in service of creating new inventions or innovations. Culturally, makerspaces, both inside and outside of schools, are associated with collaboration and the free flow of ideas. In schools, maker education stresses the importance of learner-driven experience, interdisciplinary learning, peer-to-peer teaching, iteration, and the notion of "failing forward", or the idea that mistake-based learning is crucial to the [[Learning|learning process]] and eventual success of a project.

== Influences ==
Maker education is an offshoot of the [[maker movement]], which ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described as "the umbrella term for independent innovators, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans, the niche is established enough to have its own magazine, ''[[Make (magazine)|Make]]'', as well as hands-on [[Maker Faire]]s that are catnip for [[:Category:Do it yourself|DIYers]] who used to toil in solitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/104210/maker-faire-maker-movement/|title=Why the Maker Movement Is Important to America's Future|last=Bajarin|first=Tim|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dale Dougherty, founder of the Maker Faire and ''Make'' magazine, stated in his 2011 TED Talk that "We are all makers. We are born makers. We don't just live, but we make." In the same TED Talk, Dougherty also called for making to be embraced in education, as students are the new generation of makers. Another central contributor to the maker movement, [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], who was once the editor-in-chief of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] and is now the CEO of [[3D Robotics]], wrote a manifesto of the maker movement in 2012, called "Makers". His third book, ''[[Makers: The New Industrial Revolution]]'' (2012), emphasizes the role that making has to play in the renaissance of American manufacturing. Mark Hatch, who is now the CEO of [[TechShop]], also published "The Maker Movement Manifesto". In addition to these contributions, seminal texts include, ''Invent To Learn: Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in the Classroom'' by [[Sylvia Libow Martinez]], and ''The Art of Tinkering,'' by Karen Wilkinson and Mike Petrich, founders of The Tinkering Studio at the [[Exploratorium]].

In the United States, hands-on learning through making has roots in the nineteenth century, as a result of the influence of educators such as [[Calvin M. Woodward]], who established the Manual Training School of Washington University on June 6, 1879. Unlike later [[Vocational education in the United States|vocational education]] that would take hold in 1917 through the Smith-Hughes Act that had the aim of reducing the United States reliance on foreign trade, the impetus for the Manual Training School was to provide students with training in making and craftsmanship that had "no immediate vocational goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The Transformation of the School: Progressivism in American Education, 1876–1957]]|last=Cremin|first=Lawrence|publisher=Vintage|year=1961|isbn=978-0394705194|location=New York|pages=26|quote="no immediate vocational goal."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's maker education highlights students' potential to "change the world"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makered.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=About Maker Ed|website=makered.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "let their imaginations run wild"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while also emphasizing building students' entrepreneurship skills and ability to earn money by selling their inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Make:|title=Why Education Needs the Maker Movement - Betty Ray|date=2015-04-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twcuJG733y4|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of the late nineteenth century is sometimes also referenced in relationship with the maker movement. The Arts and Crafts movement, which originated in Britain before taking hold in Europe and North America, was anti-industrial, critical of machinery and factory production, advocating instead for a return to traditional craftsmanship.

== Development and expansion ==
Since 2005, maker education has gained momentum in schools across the United States and around the world. Proponents of the [[maker movement]] cite the potential for making to bring more women to [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields and close the [[Gender gaps in mathematics and reading|gender gap]]. Other potential benefits and goals for making include creating greater [[educational equity]] among students in public schools, and the possibility for making to be a driver in educational and societal change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fablearn.stanford.edu/fellows/blog/steam-de-trojan-horse-making-%E2%80%9Dinclusivity%E2%80%9D|title=STEAM, de Trojan Horse for Making "Inclusivity" {{!}} FabLearn Fellows|website=fablearn.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other educators and innovators have developed offshoot curriculum and technologies related to the intersection of [[critical thinking]] and [[making]], called [[critical making]].

In school models, such as the Lighthouse Community Charter, a charter school in Oakland, California, Aaron Van der Woorf, the robotics teacher leads the students in Maker Ed. At the [[The Park School|Park School]], in collaboration with Harvard's Project Zero, students hold a mini maker faire in school that also acts as a fundraiser for the school. Some districts have also adopted maker education district-wide, such as the district of [[Elizabeth Forward School District|Elizabeth Forward]], just south of Pittsburgh, which partnered with [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] to provide professional development for teachers through working with students on Maker Ed. Principals in Albemarle County schools cite Superintendent Pam Moran as instrumental in bringing maker education to their school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-02-albemarle-county-schools-journey-from-a-makerspace-to-a-maker-district|title=Albemarle County Schools' Journey From a Makerspace to a Maker District (EdSurge News)|newspaper=EdSurge|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to bringing maker education to schools, scholars like Paulo Blikstein of Stanford University and Dennis Krannich of the University Bremen, in Germany, state that, "Digital fabrication and 'making,' and the positive social movement around them, could be an unprecedented opportunity for educators to advance a progressive educational agenda in which project-based, interest-driven, student-centered learning are at the center stage of students' educational experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blikstein|first=Paulo|last2=Krannich|first2=Dennis|year=2013|title=The makers' movement and FabLabs in education: experiences, technologies, and research|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 12th international conference on interaction design and children|volume=|pages=613–616|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penketh High School Became the first school in the United Kingdom to embedded maker education into the UK education system in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/16038242.Penketh_High_becomes_first_state_school_in_the_country_to_build_dedicated__makerspace_/|title=Penketh High becomes first state school in the country to build dedicated 'makerspace'|website=Warrington Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama Administration has also strongly supported the growing maker movement as an integral part of STEM education, which it hopes will increase American students ability to compete globally in the areas of science, engineering, and math. At the White House, President Obama hosted the first ever White House Maker Faire in June, 2014, adopting the idea that Americans are a "Nation of Makers". On the Nation of Makers webpage, Americans are encouraged to join the movement, asserting that "empowering students and adults to create, innovate, tinker, and make their ideas and solutions into reality is at the heart of the Maker Movement". Since the first-ever White House Maker Faire, the Obama Administration has "continued to support opportunities for students to learn about STEM through making, expand the resources available for maker entrepreneurs, and foster the development of advanced manufacturing in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/nation-of-makers|title=The First White House Maker Faire|website=The White House|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2015, the President announced the National Week of Making, June 17–23, to support the Nation of Makers. In 2016, President Obama renewed his commitment to maker education by continuing the National Week of Making. The National Maker Faire will include participation from the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Navy (Navy), the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). At the time of this announcement, the President also detailed the progress that had been made on the Nation of Makers. He announced, 
* Eight Federal agencies are announcing new grants, education initiatives, training, knowledge networks, and other supports to help create more makers and assist more entrepreneurs to take prototypes to scale with new ventures.
* More than 1,400 K–12 schools, representing almost 1 million students from all 50 states, are committing to dedicating a space for making, designating a champion for making, and having a public showcase of student projects.

In addition to these developments, on June 17, 2016, the White House issued a press release, detailing the next steps the United States government will take to support the development and expansion of maker education.

== Critique ==
{{See also|Critical theory of maker education}}
Though maker education has been embraced by thousands of schools and school districts across the United States and abroad, there has also emerged criticism of the movement.

Among the critics is [[Evgeny Morozov]], a Belarusian writer and researcher, whose work focuses on the impact, both social and political, of technology. In his article published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', entitled, "Making It: Pick up a spot welder and join the revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/making-it-2|title=Making It|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morozov criticizes [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] for "confusing the history of the Web with the history of capitalism and ends by speculating about the future of the maker movement, which, on closer examination, is actually speculation on the future of capitalism". He also criticizes companies and organizations that were once committed to open source software for becoming acquired by for-profit companies and embroiled in copyright and trademark lawsuits. Morozov also criticizes the maker movement's major contributors financial relationship with [[DARPA]], which made a $10 million grant to support maker education for high school students, and $3.5 million to [[TechShop]] to establish new [[makerspaces]].

While Morozov is one of the more vocal critics of maker education, he is not the only one. Debbie Chachra, associate professor at Olin College of Engineering, in her article in January 23, 2015 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', entitled, "Why I Am Not a Maker",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/|title=Why I Am Not a Maker|last=Chachra|first=Debbie|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; centers her criticism on "the social history of who makes things—and who doesn't". Chachra describes the history of the "makers" of products as men, rather than those who cared for "hearth and home", that is, historically, women. She calls for recognition of "the work of the educators, those that analyze and characterize and critique, everyone who fixes things, all the other people who do valuable work with and for others—above all, the caregivers—whose work isn't about something you can put in a box and sell". In "A more lovingly made world",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=2013|title=A More Lovingly Made World|url=|journal=Cultural Studies Review|volume=19|pages=296–304|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[McKenzie Wark]] of [[The New School]], Wark writes that the problem with maker culture is that makers don't actually make things, they assemble them. While this experience is satisfying and fun (and Wark does acknowledge the way in which his children are not hemmed in by gender expectations while playing at the Maker Faire), it doesn't teach the underlying principles required for the actual making of functional objects. It also does not, though [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] and Mark Hatch evoke Marx in their Maker manifestos, map accurately onto an understanding of labor, and certainly not the life of the laborer.

Finally, Shirin Vossoughi and Paula K. Hooper of [[Northwestern University]], and Meg Escude of [[Exploratorium]], offer an in-depth look at the ways in which maker education reinforces [[educational inequality]]. They begin by offering Haitian writer, [[Edwidge Danticat]]'s commentary on making: "If you can't afford clothes, but you can make them--make them. You have to work with what you have, especially if you don't 'have a lot of money. You use creativity, and you use imagination." Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude make the case that true making is often born from difficult environmental circumstances, and that what local communities once did as part of their daily lives (offering an exchange of skills and knowledge, for example, to help others in need in the community) is now being offered to low-income neighborhoods as an intervention program, promising greater educational equality. They argue that the "American Maker" highlighted by [[Dale Dougherty]] in his 2011 Ted Talk, is symptomatic of the problems associated with [[American exceptionalism]], in that it is "grounded in gendered, white, middle-class cultural practices". Not only do Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude critique maker education as it is currently practiced, they also offer proposed solutions for "equity-oriented design" of maker experiences which include, "critical analyses or educational injustice, historicized approaches to making as cross-cultural activity, explicit attention to pedagogy, and inquiry into the sociopolitical values and purposes of making".

{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}
'''Matte''' is a term used in the field of [[pyrometallurgy]] given to the molten metal [[sulfide]] phases typically formed during [[smelting]] of [[copper]], [[nickel]], and other base metals.  Typically, a matte is the phase in which the principal metal being extracted is recovered prior to a final reduction process (usually [[converting (metallurgy)|converting]]) to produce a crude metal.  Mattes may also be used to collect impurities from a metal phase, such as in the case of [[antimony]] smelting.  Molten mattes are insoluble in both [[slag]] and metal phases.  This insolubility, combined with differences in specific gravities between mattes, slags, and metals, allows for separation of the molten phases.

'''Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies named after M.V. Lomonosov''' (traditional abbreviation "MITHT") is one of the oldest universities in the country that offer training in a wide range of specialties in the field of [[chemical technology]].

Currently, there are more than 4,500 students in nine areas of undergraduate, 28 master's programs and 23 scientific specialties for training of candidates and doctors of science. In MITHT there are 8 dissertation councils for doctoral and PhD theses.

Research and teaching activities are performed by more than 400 professors and 158 scientists, including more than 120 doctors of science and professors. Located in Moscow at Vernadsky Avenue, Building 86 (new building complex) and Malaya Pirogovskaya, Building 1 (historic building).

== History ==

History of the University and its continuing operations as a higher education institution begins 1 July 1900 and covers several stages.

=== Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow Higher Women Courses (1900–1918) ===
1 July (14 July, [[New Style]]) 1900 was organized the [[Moscow Higher Women Courses]] (MHWC). Their structure originally consisted of two departments: History and Philosophy and [[Physics]] and Mathematics. On the last one were soon opened two offices: mathematical and natural, and after a few years two more – medical and chemical-pharmaceutical. The initiators and the first lecturers were outstanding scientists, academics subsequently [[Sergey Chaplygin|S. A. Chaplygin]], [[Vladimir Vernadsky|V. I. Vernadsky]], [[Nikolay Zelinsky|N. D. Zelinsky]] (the inventor of the [[gas mask]] (1916)), Professors V. F. Davidov, B. K. Mlodzeevskii, A. N. Reformatsky, A. A. Eichenwald, S. G. Krapivin. The first director of MHWC was Professor [[Vladimir Guerrier|V. I. Guerrier]].

In 1905 as a director was elected S. A. Chaplygin, the leading scientist in the field of [[Hydrodynamics|hydro]]- and [[aerodynamics]], the organizer of the construction of school buildings on the Malaya Pirogovskaya street (formerly Devichie Pole). He remained in that post until 1918.

By the beginning of [[World War I]] MHWC turned into the one of the largest higher education institutions in the country. The number of trainees reached 710, and during the existence of courses released 5760 professionals. In turning into a first-class university MHWC paramount importance had an exceptional organizational skill of S. A. Chaplygin, later shown to them with equal brilliance in creating [[TsAGI]].

=== Department of Chemistry of the 2nd Moscow State University (1918–30) ===
16 October 1918 MHWC were converted into second Moscow State University. The first rector of the 2nd Moscow State University was appointed [[academician]] [[Sergey Namyotkin|S. S. Nametkin]] who worked since 1913 as a head of the Department of [[Organic Chemistry]] of MHWC. As rector, he remained until 1924. As part of the 2nd Moscow State University became the chemical-pharmaceutical department, which in 1919 was transformed into the chemical and pharmaceutical department.  At this time, on the faculty worked well-known Professors A. M. Berkengeim, B. K. Mlodzeevskii, S. S. Nametkin, M. I. Prozin, A. N. Reformatsky, [[O. N. Tsuberbiller]]. In 1929, the faculty became a chemical faculty of the university type with specialties such as:
* Chemical – pharmaceutical chemistry;
* Basic chemistry;
* [[Aniline]] chemistry;
* Chemistry of [[Rare-earth element|rare elements]];
* Coke-benzene chemistry;
* Organic Synthesis.

Faculty graduates go to work in the factories, involve in the implementation of research projects that receive a wide scope. During 1922 – 1928 years it has been published about 300 papers and 11 monographs. The greatest successes are achieved in the fields of organic and [[pharmaceutical chemistry]] under the direction of heads of departments, academics S. S. Nametkin, B. M. Rodionov, Professor A. M. Berkengeim. Production of new drugs being introduced in the pharmaceutical factory belonging to faculty.

=== Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology (1930–92) ===
18 April 1930 by order of the [[People's Commissariat]] second MSU was reorganized into three independent institutions: Medical (now [[Russian National Research Medical University|RSMU them. Pirogov]]) Pedagogical (now [[Moscow State Pedagogical University|MPSU]]), and Chemical Technology (now MITHT). Last transferred to the jurisdiction of the Vsehimprom [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy|VSNKh]] [[USSR]]. In addressing this issue directly involved [[Grigory Ordzhonikidze|Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].

10 May 1931 Chemical and Pharmaceutical Faculty became an independent and received a new name – the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology (MITHT). Historically, the name of the Institute is due to the nature of objects that are studied by students: they were small capacity chemical and pharmaceutical technology, technology of [[platinum group]] metals and [[rare-earth elements]]. From this moment begins a new stage of development of the institution, which is quickly becoming one of the leading universities in the [[chemical industry]]. Front of it set the goal of training for high-tech industries of chemical technology. In MITHT the first time in the country began to train engineers on the technology of thin inorganic products, synthetic rubber, thin organic produce synthetic [[liquid fuel]]s, [[organometallic compounds]] and a number of other specialties.

In the process of restructuring of education at the institute have been preserved and developed the best traditions of MHWC and 2nd Moscow State University: a high level of theoretical training and a combination of academic and scientific work, helped by the fact that the teaching work at the institute and chairing of departments were performed by outstanding scientists and educators which created a school and research areas.

Special departments were prepared engineers for industries which were still being created in the first five years. At the time, were of great importance establishment of a domestic pharmaceutical industry and the country's liberation on imports of medicines. Were developed and implemented methods of production of such drugs as [[atophan]], [[benzocaine]], [[procaine]], [[bromural]], [[thiokol]], [[ichtyol]], [[validol]], [[antipyrine]], [[caffeine]], [[alkaloid]]s and others. In 1938, in MITHT under the leadership of academic [[Alexander Nesmeyanov|A. N. Nesmeyanov]] (later President of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|RAS]]) began work in the field of organometallic compounds. Also, the Institute prepared professionals for the companies producing such important national defense materials, such as [[tungsten]], [[molybdenum]], [[vanadium]], and [[rare-earth elements]]. So, Professor I. Ya. Bashilov created the production technology of [[uranium]] and [[radium]]. And under the guidance of Professor G. A. Meyerson were carried out important work on carbothermy and getting [[Superhard material|super-hard alloys]].

7 May 1940 for academic achievement and great progress in the preparation of chemists institute is named after the outstanding Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov]].

During the war, groups of departments in collaboration with industry and research institutes conduct intensive research on defense-related development and implementation of the executed work. Thus, under the supervision of Professor N. I. Gelperin was created the most powerful bomb in [[World War II]] – FAB-5000NG that terrified [[Hitlerites]]. Efforts of the Institute as a whole and individual professors and teachers were appreciated by the country. Professors B. A. Dogadkin, N. I. Krasnopevtsev, V. V. Lebedinskij, S. S. Medvedev, S. I. Sklyarenko and Ya. K. Sirkin were awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] laureates, and associate professor K. A. Bolshakov won that title twice.

The post-war period was characterized by intensive work of the Institute staff in the aftermath of the war, the creation of the necessary conditions for teaching and research. Among the most important achievements of the postwar period MITHT need to include: 
* The total synthesis of a number of natural alkaloids – [[pilocarpine]], pilozinin, alkaloids of [[propane]] series ([[tropine]], [[cocaine]]), [[arecoline]], [[eserine]], [[emetine]], [[psyhotrine]], [[emataliine]], [[cinchonamine]], [[tubocurarine]] and other alkaloids of [[curare]] ([[magnolin]], [[magnolamine]], [[dauricine]]). For this work, Professor N. A. Preobragensky in 1952 was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] of the first degree;
* The synthesis of physiologically active derivatives of [[piperidine]] ([[anesthetics]], [[analgesics]], and other drugs), technology development and industrial development of high-output [[painkiller]] "[[promedol]]";
* Academician A. N. Bashkirov for the first time in the world and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1959 has been implemented industrial technology for production of higher [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[alcohols]] on the basis of a synthesis of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] (the so-called "oxosynthesis technology");
* Development of technology for the production of vitamins [[Retinol|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Vitamin E|E]], [[Ascorbic acid|C]] and [[Vitamin K|K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]];
* Create rubbers based on new types of caoutchouc, operating at high and low temperatures in harsh operating conditions.

The high scientific – technical research conducted at the institute, evidenced by the fact that MITHT became one of the first places among the universities and research institutes on the number of implemented inventions. Employees of the institute published 450–500 scientific papers and received 50–60 [[Patent|invention certificates]] a year. The Institute conducts research on economic agreements and contracts on cooperation with industry and research institutes, whose number exceeded 150.

MITHT, in fact, has turned into a complex of the university and research institutes. On 2500–3000 students, in addition to 400 professors and lecturers, employed more than 900 scientists. Two to one – that is the ratio of students, academic and teaching staff, which was reached in MITHT. Good specialist, engineer cannot be prepared without bringing him to participate in real, serious scientific research in the learning process.

11 February 1971 for his services to the training of specialists for the national economy and the development of scientific research institute was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].

Education in MITHT always featured a deep fundamental training, which included, along with a full range of natural sciences study the big cycle engineering and technological disciplines. Special training was carried out by the so-called "thin" chemical technologies that are, as a rule, small capacity technology, implemented on the basis of the latest achievements of chemical science and technology. That is, in fact, the students received a university degree in combination with engineering training.

=== Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technology named after M. V. Lomonosov (1992–2011) ===
In 1992, the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology named after M. V. Lomonosov has received a new, higher educational status – status of the Academy. With the name change has changed the status and range of activities of the institute along with old technology, new specialty Humanitarian – Management Profile: "Economics and Management (chemical industry)", "[[Environmental Protection]]", "[[Standardization]] and [[Certification]]". These specialties are subject to major technologies and solve their narrow-profile tasks.

Before the transition to a tiered structure the education of students was carried out in one direction, "Chemical Technology and [[Biotechnology]]", which consists of seven specialties. After the transition academy led training in seven areas of undergraduate, graduate five areas (including 26 master's programs) and 13 majors (including 25 majors) in full-time and part-correspondence courses, and conducted post-graduate education in 24 specialties and additional education in primary educational programs MITHT.

To implement in MITHT a tiered system of higher education were opened new training units. Along with main faculties teaching of students was performed at the Faculty of [[Natural Science]], Faculty of [[Humanities]], Faculty of Management, Economics and Environment, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of further education at the Institute of [[Distance Education]].

According to the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Federal Agency for Supervision in Education and Science]] in 2008 in MITHT worked one of the most highly qualified scientific and technical teaching staff of universities and academies of Russia: doctors and candidates of sciences accounted for about 80% of the teachers. At the academy a total enrollment of 4,500 undergraduate and graduate students, taught 119 professors, doctors, and 218 associate professors, candidates of sciences.

=== Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies (2011–present) ===
[[File:Panorama of MITHT.jpg|center|1200px|thumb|Panorama of MITHT main building on Vernadsky prospect in Moscow, Russia]]
In 2011, the Academy received a University status.

The successes of the University in education, research and [[innovation]], the recognition of the scientific and pedagogical schools, its international status and worldwide fame are undoubtedly merit in the first professors, assistant professors, lecturers, and they have created in the walls of the university unique creative scientific and educational environment. Friendly and supportive atmosphere of the business and human interaction with the students and teachers together form the necessary conditions for the development of the individual, focused, motivated professional growth.

The term '''mutual shaping''' was developed through [[Science and Technology Studies]] (STS) in an attempt to explain the detailed process of technological design.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping is a combination of [[social determinism]] and [[technological determinism]], suggesting that society and technology are not mutually exclusive to one another and, instead, influence and shape each other.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of TD and SD ==
[[Technological determinism]] (TD), coined by [[Thorstein Veblen]], suggests that technology is the primary catalyst for change in society. Following this theory, the development and implementation of technology is beyond the control of society as it is pervasive in all elements of our lives. Once a technology has been created its influence on society is an inevitable, predetermined path. An example that supports technological determinism is the development of the [[printing press]] that accelerated the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L. (2010). Technological determinism. In S. Priest (Ed.), Encyclopedia of science and technology communication. (pp. 870-873). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959216.n293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, social determinism (SD), popularized by social theorists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Emile Durkheim]], purports that social structure is the driving factor towards change in society.&lt;ref&gt;Determinism. (2001). In World of sociology, Gale. Retrieved from http://esearch.credoreference.com/content/entry/worldsocs/determinism/0&lt;/ref&gt; Following this view, society is the governing force that determines social behaviour, and technology is created and adapted based on society’s wants and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mahood, Aurelea. (2008). Social and technological determinism. CultureNet @ CapilanoU. Retrieved from http://culturenet.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/social-and-technological-determinism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Both TD and SD are cause-and-effect theories suggesting that technology and society are mutually exclusive. The theory of mutual shaping suggests that technology design is a result of a synthesis of TD and SD. It sees technology and society working together to facilitate change. Society changes as a direct result of the implementation of technology that has been created based on society’s wants and needs. They function collectively to shape one another.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In social networks ==
Mutual shaping is exemplified through the integration of online [[Social networking|social networking platforms]] into daily life. They are a [[communications technology]] designed to complement pre-existing methods of communication, such as the phone or in-person conversations, that have become more convenient and/or affordable than their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = B. | last2 = Quan-Haase | first2 = A. | last3 = Witte | first3 = J. | last4 = Hampton | first4 = K. | year = 2013 | title = Does the internet increase, decrease, or supplement social capital?: Social networks, participation, and community commitment | url = | journal = American Behavioral Scientist| volume =  45| issue = | pages =  436–455 [440] | doi = 10.1177/00027640121957286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TD would argue that these communication technologies have directly influenced our networking capabilities due to their accessibility. Without them we would not be able to conduct business or maintain friendships over long distances. SD would argue that these platforms were created as a result of a need to facilitate communication over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping supports both of these arguments, believing that the two cannot be separated. Social networking platforms display how technology and society are inextricably linked as they work together towards the advancement of one another, exemplifying the theory of mutual shaping.

[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Tables of natural history, from [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]
'''Natural history''' is a domain of inquiry involving [[organism]]s including [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s in their environment; leaning more towards [[observation]]al than [[experiment]]al methods of study. A person who studies natural history is called a '''naturalist''' or '''natural historian'''.

Natural history encompasses [[Scientific method|scientific research]] but is not limited to it.&lt;ref&gt;With ''natural history'' articles more often published today in [[List of science magazines|science magazines]] than in [[scientific journal|academic journals]].([http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history Natural History ''WordNet Search, princeton.edu''].&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic study of any category of [[nature|natural]] objects or organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{Citation |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while it dates from studies in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]] and the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|mediaeval Arabic world]], through to European [[Renaissance]] naturalists working in near isolation, today's natural history is a [[cross discipline]] umbrella of many specialty sciences; e.g., [[geobiology]] has a strong multi-disciplinary nature.

==Definitions==
===Before 1900===
The meaning of the English term "natural history" (a [[calque]] of the [[Latin]] ''historia naturalis'') has narrowed progressively with time; while, by contrast, the meaning of the related term "nature" has widened (see also [[#History|History]] below).

In [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], "natural history" covered essentially anything connected with [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], or which used materials drawn from nature, such as [[Pliny the Elder]]'s [[Natural History (Pliny)|encyclopedia of this title]], published [[circa]] 77 to 79 AD, which covers [[astronomy]], [[geography]], humans and their [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[superstition]], as well as animals and plants.

Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions: the [[humanities]] (primarily what is now known as [[classics]]) and [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]], with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment. The study of nature revived in the [[Renaissance]], and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge, itself divided into descriptive natural history and  [[natural philosophy]], the analytical study of nature. In modern terms, natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], while natural history included the [[biology|biological]] and [[geology|geological]] sciences. The two were strongly associated. During the heyday of the [[gentleman scientist]]s, many people contributed to both fields, and early papers in both were commonly read at professional [[Academy of Sciences|science society]] meetings such as the [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] – both founded during the seventeenth century.

Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives, such as Linnaeus' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koerner |first=Lisbet |authorlink=Lisbet Rausing |title=Linnaeus: Nature and Nation |year=1999 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-09745-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted the development of geology to help find useful [[mineral]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Barnes and Steven Shapin, "Natural order: historical studies of scientific culture", Sage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1900===
Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources, and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field, creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them. For example, while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study, it can also be defined as a body of knowledge, and as a craft or a practice, in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lowe Fleischner, ''The Way of Natural History'', Trinity University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lycee Michelet Vanves bibliotheque collection histoire naturelle.jpg|thumb|left|A natural history collection in a French public secondary school]]
Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment, as seen in this definition by Marston Bates: "Natural history is the study of animals and Plants – of organisms. ... I like to think, then, of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual – of what plants and animals do, how they react to each other and their environment, how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities"&lt;ref&gt;Marston Bates, ''The nature of natural history'', Scribners, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and this more recent definition by D.S. Wilcove and T. Eisner: "The close observation of organisms—their origins, their evolution, their behavior, and their relationships with other species".&lt;ref&gt;D. S Wilcove and T. Eisner, "The impending extinction of natural history," Chronicle of Higher Education 15 (2000): B24&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on organisms in their environment is also echoed by H.W. Greene and J.B. Losos: "Natural history focuses on where organisms are and what they do in their environment, including interactions with other organisms. It encompasses changes in internal states insofar as they pertain to what organisms do".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Greene and J. B. Losos, "Systematics, Natural-History, and Conservation – Field Biologists Must Fight a Public-Image Problem," Bioscience 38 (1988): 458–462&lt;/ref&gt;

Some definitions go further, focusing on direct observation of organisms in their environment, both past and present, such as this one by G.A. Bartholomew: "A student of natural history, or a naturalist, studies the world by observing plants and animals directly. Because organisms are functionally inseparable from the environment in which they live and because their structure and function cannot be adequately interpreted without knowing some of their evolutionary history, the study of natural history embraces the study of fossils as well as physiographic and other aspects of the physical environment".&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Bartholomew, "The Role of Natural History in Contemporary Biology", Bioscience 36 (1986): 324–329&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread in many definitions of natural history is the inclusion of a descriptive component, as seen in a recent definition by H.W. Greene: "Descriptive ecology and ethology".&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Greene, "Organisms in nature as a central focus for biology", Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20 (2005):23–27&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have argued for a more expansive view of natural history, including S. Herman, who defines the field as "the scientific study of plants and animals in their natural environments. It is concerned with levels of organization from the individual organism to the ecosystem, and stresses identification, life history, distribution, abundance, and inter-relationships.

It often and appropriately includes an esthetic component",&lt;ref&gt;S. G Herman, "Wildlife biology and natural history: time for a reunion", The Journal of wildlife management 66, no. 4 (2002): 933–946&lt;/ref&gt; and T. Fleischner, who defines the field even more broadly, as "A practice of intentional, focused attentiveness and receptivity to the more-than-human world, guided by honesty and accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Fleischner, "Natural history and the spiral of offering", Wild Earth 11, no. 3/4 (2002): 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions explicitly include the arts in the field of natural history, and are aligned with the broad definition outlined by B. Lopez, who defines the field as the "Patient interrogation of a landscape" while referring to the natural history knowledge of the Eskimo ([[Inuit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barry Lopez, ''Arctic Dreams'', Vintage, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different framework for natural history, covering a similar range of themes, is also implied in the scope of work encompassed by many leading [[natural history museum]]s, which often include elements of anthropology, geology, paleontology and astronomy along with botany and zoology,&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History, [http://www.amnh.org/about/ Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145807/http://www.amnh.org/about/ |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field Museum, [http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103185243/http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or include both cultural and natural components of the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Natural History Museum, [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/index.html Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plurality of definitions for this field has been recognized as both a weakness and a strength, and a range of definitions have recently been offered by practitioners in a recent collection of views on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://declinetorebirth.org/conversations/an-accepted-way-of-viewing-art An Accepted Way of Viewing Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Blackberry]] from the 6th century ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'' manuscript]]
Natural history begins with [[Aristotle]] and other ancient philosophers who analyzed the diversity of the natural world. Natural history was understood by [[Pliny the Elder]] to cover anything that could be found in the world, including living things, geology, astronomy, technology, art and humanity.&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;{{cite book | title=Natural History: A Selection | publisher=Penguin Classics | author=Pliny the Elder | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-14-044413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' was written between 50 and 70 AD by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], a Roman physician of Greek origin. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted in the [[Renaissance]], making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books.

From the [[ancient Greeks]] until the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]] and other 18th century naturalists, a major concept of natural history was the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]], an arrangement of minerals, vegetables, more primitive forms of animals, and more complex life forms on a linear scale of supposedly increasing perfection, culminating in our species.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964&gt;{{citation |date=1964 | origyear=1936 |author=Arthur O. Lovejoy |authorlink=Arthur Oncken Lovejoy |title=The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u3HZjTpkTgC |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Natural history was basically static through the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe – although in the [[Arabic]] and [[Oriental]] world it proceeded at a much brisker pace. From the thirteenth century, the work of Aristotle was adapted rather rigidly into [[Christian philosophy]], particularly by [[Thomas Aquinas]], forming the basis for [[natural theology]]. During the Renaissance, scholars (herbalists and humanists, particularly) returned to direct observation of plants and animals for natural history, and many began to accumulate large collections of exotic specimens and unusual [[monster]]s. [[Leonhart Fuchs]] was one of the three founding fathers of botany, along with [[Otto Brunfels]] and [[Hieronymus Bock]]. Other important contributors to the field were [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Konrad Gesner]] (''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]''), [[Frederik Ruysch]], or [[Gaspard Bauhin]].&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;"[http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?category=Natural+History Natural History Timeline]". HistoryofScience.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid increase in the number of known organisms prompted many attempts at classifying and organizing species into [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]], culminating in the system of the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;ref name="natural"/&gt;

===Birth of scientific biology===&lt;!--off topic? Biology isn't NH--&gt;
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges Buffon]] is best remembered for his ''[[Histoire naturelle]]'', a 44 volume encyclopedia describing quadrupeds, birds, minerals and some science and technology. Reptiles and fish were covered in supplements by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]].]]&lt;!--not discussed in text, no refs!--&gt;
A significant contribution to English natural history was made by [[parson-naturalist]]s such as [[Gilbert White]], [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]], [[John George Wood]], and [[John Ray]], who wrote about plants, animals, and other aspects of nature. Many of these men wrote about nature to make the [[natural theology]] argument for the existence or goodness of God.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Armstrong|title=The English Parson-naturalist: A Companionship Between Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB0hEc4CN3wC|accessdate=31 March 2013|year=2000|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|isbn=978-0-85244-516-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Europe]], professional disciplines such as botany, geology, [[mycology]], [[palaeontology]], [[physiology]] and [[zoology]] were formed. ''Natural history'', formerly the main subject taught by college science professors, was increasingly scorned by scientists of a more specialized manner and relegated to an "amateur" activity, rather than a part of science proper. In Victorian Scotland it was believed that the study of natural history contributed to good mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |title='An aid to mental health': natural history, alienists and therapeutics in Victorian Scotland| author=Finnegan, Diarmid A. |year=2008 |volume=39 |pages=326–337 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2008.06.006| pmid=18761284| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in Britain and the United States, this grew into specialist hobbies such as the [[Ornithology|study of birds]], butterflies, seashells ([[malacology]]/[[conchology]]), beetles and wildflowers; meanwhile, scientists tried to define a unified discipline of biology (though with only partial success, at least until the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]). Still, the traditions of natural history continue to play a part in the study of biology, especially ecology (the study of natural systems involving living organisms and the inorganic components of the Earth's biosphere that support them), [[ethology]] (the scientific study of animal behavior), and [[evolutionary biology]] (the study of the relationships between life-forms over very long periods of time), and re-emerges today as integrative organismal biology.

Amateur collectors and natural history entrepreneurs played an important role in building the world's large natural history collections, such as the [[Natural History Museum, London]], and the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington D.C.

Three of the greatest English naturalists of the nineteenth century, [[Henry Walter Bates]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]—who all knew each other—each made natural history travels that took years, collected thousands of specimens, many of them new to science, and by their writings both advanced knowledge of "remote" parts of the world—the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], and the [[Malay archipelago]], among others—and in so doing helped to transform biology from a descriptive to a theory based science.

The understanding of "Nature" as "an organism and not as a mechanism" can be traced to the writings of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (Prussia, 1769–1859). Humboldt's copious writings and research were seminal influences for Charles Darwin, [[Simón Bolívar]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], and [[John Muir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Wulf]] (2015),''[[The Invention of Nature]]'', Knopf {{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
{{further|List of natural history museums}}
Natural history [[museum]]s, which evolved from [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]], played an important role in the emergence of professional biological disciplines and research programs. Particularly in the 19th century, scientists began to use their natural history collections as teaching tools for advanced students and the basis for their own [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] research.

==Societies==
[[File:Szczecin pomnik Jana Czekanowskiego.jpg|thumb|The monument of [[Jan Czekanowski]], a president of [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]] (1923–1924), in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]]]
The term "natural history" alone, or sometimes together with archaeology, forms the name of many national, regional and local natural history societies that maintain records for [[animal]]s (including [[birds]] (ornithology), [[insect]]s ([[entomology]]) and [[mammal]]s (mammalogy)), [[fungi]] ([[mycology]]), plants (botany) and other organisms. They may also have [[geological]] and [[microscope|microscopical]] sections.

Examples of these societies in Britain include the [[Natural History Society of Northumbria]] founded in 1829, [[London]] Natural History Society (1858), [[Birmingham Natural History Society]] (1859), [[British Entomological and Natural History Society]] founded in 1872, [[Glasgow]] Natural History Society, [[Manchester]] Microscopical and Natural History Society established in 1880, Whitby Naturalists' Club founded in 1913,&lt;ref name="whitbynaturalistsclub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitbynaturalists.co.uk |title=Whitby Naturalists' Club |publisher=whitbynaturalists.co.uk |accessdate=January 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarborough Field Naturalists' Society and the Sorby Natural History Society, [[Sheffield]], founded in 1918.&lt;ref name="WMBC-Oldest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older|title=Older Organisations|last=Mabbett|first=Andy|date=20 November 2010|publisher=[[West Midland Bird Club]]|accessdate=11 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523040849/http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older |archivedate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of natural history societies was also spurred due to the growth of British colonies in tropical regions with numerous new species to be discovered. Many [[civil servants]] took an interest in their new surroundings, sending specimens back to museums in [[UK|Britain]]. (See also: [[Indian natural history]])

Societies in other countries include the [[American Society of Naturalists]] and [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]].

[[File:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Is it material composition, or organization of parts, that creates the mutual [[symbiosis]] between [[Amphiprion]] [[clownfish]] and tropical [[sea anemone]]s?]]
'''Organicism''' is the philosophical perspective which views the [[universe]] and its parts as organic wholes and – either by analogy or literally – as living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory that everything in nature has an organic basis or is part of an organic whole" [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be synonymous with [[holism]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Organicism is an important tradition within the history of [[natural philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, the philosophers of the [[Ionian Enlightenment]] were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as ''[[Hylozoism|hylozoists]]'' meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see [[Benjamin Farrington|Farrington]] (1941/53)&lt;/ref&gt; where it has remained as a vital current alongside [[reductionism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], the approaches that have dominated science since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see [[Fritjof Capra|Capra]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] is among the earliest philosophers to have regarded the universe as an intelligent living being (see ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''). Organicism flourished for a period during the era of [[German romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular the writings of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Goethe]]&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the new science of biology was first defined by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Within modern-day [[Biology|biological]] [[sciences]] organicism is the approach that stresses the organization (particularly the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] properties), rather than the composition, of [[organism]]s. [[John Scott Haldane]] was the first biologist to use the term to describe his philosophical views in 1917, after which it was followed by certain other biologists in the 20th century.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and [[reductionism]] (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects [[vitalism]], the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" &gt;Fritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.&lt;ref&gt;What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from [[monism]] (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe)  to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in [[symbolic logic]], in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], or in metaphysics.

[[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. "Holism," the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by "[[holistic medicine]]" and by [[New Age]] Thought. German [[Nazism]] appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet [[Dialectical Materialism]] also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from [[Hegel]] via [[Karl Marx]]'s co-worker [[Friedrich Engels]], again giving a controversial political association to organicism.

Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], Jacques Novicow, [[Albert Schäffle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[René Worms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Barberis, "In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism.

==In biology==

In breathing entities, cells – i.e., the smallest unit of life – were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"biology". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/science/biology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" /&gt; puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from "the parts to the whole" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology.

In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are  a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology]'', Joseph Needham,  Journal of Philosophical Studies''  1928 . Accessed Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are [[Ross Granville Harrison|Ross Harrison]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. [[Donna Haraway]] discusses them in her first book ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields''. [[John Scott Haldane]] (father of [[J. B. S. Haldane]]), [[William Emerson Ritter]], [[E. S. Russell|Edward Stuart Russell]], [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], founder of "Relational Biology" provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. 1991. "Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Columbia University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Biology Club===

In the early 1930s [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] and [[Joseph Needham]], together with [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], Dorothy Needham, and [[Dorothy Wrinch]], formed the [[Theoretical Biology Club]], to promote the organicist approach to [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Organic|last=Peterson|first=Erik|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822944669|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was in opposition to [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[reductionism]] and the [[gene-centric view of evolution]]. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of molecular biology, Michel Morange, Matthew Cobb, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950, Christopher Lawrence, George Weisz, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The future of DNA, Johannes Wirz, Edith T.

'''''Physics and Beyond''''' ({{lang-de|Der Teil und das Ganze: Gespräche im Umkreis der Atomphysik}}) is a book by [[Werner Heisenberg]],&lt;ref name="Hufbauer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hufbauer|first=Karl|year=1971|title=Book Reviews|journal=[[Isis (journal)|ISIS]]|publisher=[[History of Science Society]]|volume=62|issue=4|page=558|issn=1545-6994|jstor=i302295}}&lt;/ref&gt; the  German physicist who discovered the [[uncertainty principle]]. It tells, from his point of view, the history of exploring atomic science and quantum mechanics in the first half of the 20th century.

As the subtitle "Encounters and Conversations" suggests, the core part of this book takes the form of discussions between himself and other scientists. Heisenberg says: "I wanted to show that science is done by people, and the most wonderful ideas come from dialog".

With chapters like "The first encounter with the science about atoms", "Quantum mechanics and conversations with Einstein", "Conversation about the relation between biology, physics and chemistry" or "Conversations about language" and "The behavior of an individual during a political disaster", dated 1937-1941, a reader can hear speaking such persons as [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Albert Einstein]] or [[Max Planck]], not only about physics, but also about many other questions related to biology, humans, philosophy, and politics.

Not only that, these conversations are often situated in detailed description of the historical atmosphere and a beautiful scenery, as many of them were led in nature during the many journeys they made, backpacking or sailing. "'Do you see whales, Heisenberg?', 'Yes, I see only whales, but I hope they are only big waves.'", is one of humorous scenes when the author, Bohr and other friends were sailing in a dark night.

The book provides a first-hand account about how science is done and how [[quantum physics]], especially the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], emerged.

"Nobody can reproduce these conversations verbatim, but I believe that the spirit of what the people said, and how they did, is conserved," the author tries to explain in the preface.

Many believe that the golden years of physics around 1925, when "even small people could do big things" are gone. But the people who had been there continue to speak to us through this book.

The book was published first in German 1969, in English as ''Physics and Beyond'' (1971) and in  French in 1972 (La partie et le tout).

'''Pseudoscience''' consists of statements, [[belief]]s, or practices that are claimed to be both scientific and factual, but are incompatible with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|Definition:
* "A pretended or spurious science; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have," ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition 1989.
* "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), '[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.' These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific."&lt;ref name="SEP section SciPse"/&gt;
* '"claims presented so that they appear [to be] scientific even though they lack supporting evidence and plausibility"(p. 33). In contrast, science is "a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation"(p. 17)'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shermer|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this was the [https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c7/c7s5.htm definition adopted by] the [[National Science Foundation]])}} Pseudoscience is often characterized by contradictory, exaggerated or [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable claims]]; reliance on [[confirmation bias]] rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts; and absence of systematic practices when developing theories, and continued adherence long after they have been experimentally discredited. The term ''pseudoscience'' is considered [[pejorative]]&lt;ref name="Freitsch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frietsch|first1=Ute|name-list-format=vanc|title=The boundaries of science / pseudoscience|journal=European History Online (EGO)|date=7 April 2015|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/crossroads/knowledge-spaces/ute-frietsch-the-boundaries-of-science-pseudoscience|access-date=15 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415202501/http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/crossroads/knowledge-spaces/ute-frietsch-the-boundaries-of-science-pseudoscience|archivedate=15 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it suggests something is being presented as science inaccurately or even deceptively. Those described as practicing or advocating pseudoscience often dispute the characterization.&lt;ref name="SEP section SciPse"&gt;{{citation |chapter-url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science |chapter = Science and Pseudoscience |at= Section 2: The "science" of pseudoscience |title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year = 2008 |first = Sven Ove |last = Hansson | name-list-format = vanc |ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] between science and pseudoscience has [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]] implications.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Differentiating science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of [[health care]], [[Expert witness|expert testimony]], [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]], and [[science education]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"/&gt; Distinguishing scientific facts and theories from pseudoscientific beliefs, such as those found in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[alternative medicine]], [[occult]] beliefs, and [[creation science]], is part of science education and [[scientific literacy]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt;

Pseudoscience can cause negative consequences in the real world. [[Antivaccine]] activists present pseudoscientific studies that falsely call into question the safety of vaccines. [[Homeopathy|Homeopathic]] remedies with no active ingredients have been promoted as treatment for deadly diseases.

==Etymology==
The word ''pseudoscience'' is derived from the Greek root ''pseudo'' meaning false&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Free Dictionary |chapter=pseudo |publisher=Farlex, Inc. |year=2015 |chapter-url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pseudo |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary | url = https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=pseudo |year=2015 |publisher=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the English word ''science'', from the Latin word ''scientia'', meaning "knowledge". Although the term has been in use since at least the late 18th century (e.g. in 1796 by [[James Pettit Andrews]] in reference to alchemy&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Andrews|Henry|1796|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the concept of pseudoscience as distinct from real or proper science seems to have become more widespread during the mid-19th century. Among the earliest uses of "pseudo-science" was in an 1844 article in the ''Northern Journal of Medicine'', issue 387:
{{quote|text=That opposite kind of innovation which pronounces what has been recognized as a branch of science, to have been a pseudo-science, composed merely of so-called facts, connected together by misapprehensions under the disguise of principles.}}

An earlier use of the term was in 1843 by the French physiologist [[François Magendie]].&lt;ref name="Magendie1843"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Magendie F  |year=1843 |title=An Elementary Treatise on Human Physiology |edition=5th |location=New York |publisher=Harper |page=150 |ref=harv |others=John Revere}} Magendie refers to phrenology as "''a pseudo-science of the present day''"&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the word was used pejoratively to describe explanations of phenomena which were claimed to be scientific, but which were not in fact supported by reliable experimental evidence.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Still/&gt; --&gt; From time-to-time, though, the usage of the word occurred in a more formal, technical manner in response to a perceived threat to individual and institutional security in a social and cultural setting.&lt;ref name=Still&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Theory Soc Behav |year=2004 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=265–90 |title=The Social Psychology of "Pseudoscience": A Brief History | vauthors = Still A, Dryden W | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8308.2004.00248.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the word ''[[science]]'' is used to indicate specifically the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] and related fields, which are called the [[Social science|social sciences]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/pseudo-science/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Hansson|first=Sven Ove|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different philosophers of science may disagree on the exact limits – for example, is mathematics a [[formal science]] that is closer to the empirical ones, or is pure mathematics closer to the philosophical study of [[logic]] and therefore not a science?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory|author=Bunge, Mario Augusto|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7658-0413-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but all agree that all of the ideas that are not scientific are non-scientific.  The large category of [[non-science]] includes all matters outside the natural and social sciences, such as the study of [[history]], [[metaphysics]], [[religion]], [[art]], and the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dividing the category again, unscientific claims are a subset of the large category of non-scientific claims.  This category specifically includes all matters that are directly opposed to good science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Unscience|Un-science]] includes both [[Bad science (philosophy)|bad science]] (such as an error made in a good-faith attempt at learning something about the natural world) and pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Thus pseudoscience is a subset of un-science, and un-science, in turn, is subset of non-science.

==Relationship to science==
Pseudoscience is differentiated from science because – although it claims to be science – pseudoscience does not adhere to accepted scientific standards, such as the scientific method, falsifiability of claims, and Mertonian norms.

===Scientific method===
{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:The_Scientific_Method_(simple).png|thumb|The scientific method is a continuous cycle of hypothesis, prediction, testing and questioning.]]
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|A typical 19th-century [[phrenology]] chart: During the 1820s, phrenologists claimed the mind was located in areas of the brain, and were attacked for doubting that mind came from the nonmaterial soul. Their idea of reading "bumps" in the skull to predict personality traits was later discredited.&lt;ref name="bowler"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bowler J |authorlink=Peter J. Bowler | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |edition=3rd |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-520-23693-6 |ref=harv |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phrenology was first termed a pseudoscience in 1843 and continues to be considered so.&lt;ref name="Magendie1843"/&gt;]]

A number of basic principles are accepted by scientists as standards for determining whether a body of knowledge, method, or practice is scientific. Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3–5 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of [[statistical significance|significance]], [[confidence interval|confidence]], and [[margin of error|error]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=191 ''ff''}}, especially Chapter 6, "Probability", and Chapter 7, "inductive Logic and Statistics"&lt;/ref&gt; are also important tools for the scientific method.

===Falsifiability===
{{Main|Falsifiability}}
During the mid-20th century, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] emphasized the criterion of [[falsifiability]] to distinguish [[science]] from nonscience.&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl | name-list-format = vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1959 |title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery |isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 |publisher= Routledge |ref= harv|title-link= The Logic of Scientific Discovery }} The German version is currently in print by Mohr Siebeck ({{ISBN|3-16-148410-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt; [[proposition|Statements]], [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], or [[theory|theories]] have falsifiability or refutability if there is the inherent possibility that they can be proven [[False (logic)|false]]. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria for the differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. No matter what test you think you can devise, there is then a reason why this does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; "Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?". He states that "your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].

===Mertonian norms===
{{Main|Mertonian norms}}
During 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five "norms" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:
* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.
* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.
* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.
* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.
* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.&lt;ref name="Paradigms Lost"&gt;{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science|year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=51–52 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusal to acknowledge problems===
During 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of "belief fields" and "research fields" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the term===
Philosophers of science such as [[Paul Feyerabend]] argued that a distinction between science and nonscience is neither possible nor desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors= Feyerabend P |date= 1975 |title= Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge |isbn= 978-0-86091-646-8 |chapter-url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm |chapter= Table of contents and final chapter |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212002717/http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm |archivedate= 2007-12-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|'A particularly radical reinterpretation of science comes from Paul Feyerabend, "the worst enemy of science"... Like Lakatos, Feyerabend was also a student under Popper. In an interview with Feyerabend in ''Science'', [he says] "Equal weight... should be given to competing avenues of knowledge such as astrology, acupunture, and witchcraft..."'&lt;ref name="Gauch2003"&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Among the issues which can make the distinction difficult is variable rates of evolution among the theories and methods of science in response to new data.{{refn|name=fredb|group=Note|"We can now propose the following principle of demarcation: A theory or discipline which purports to be scientific is pseudoscientific if and only if: it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and non confirmations."&lt;ref name="harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228"&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Larry Laudan]] has suggested pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly used to describe our emotions: "If we would stand up and be counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us".&lt;ref name = "Laudan_1996"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |date=1996 |chapter= The demise of the demarcation problem | veditors = Ruse M | title = But Is It Science?: The Philosophical Question in the Creation/Evolution Controversy |pages= 337–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Richard McNally]] states, "The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites" and "When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How do you know that your intervention works? What is your evidence?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= McNally RJ |url= http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html |title= Is the pseudoscience concept useful for clinical psychology? |journal= The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |date= 2003 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100430162007/http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html |archivedate= 2010-04-30 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative definition===
For philosophers [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome R. Ravetz]] "pseudo-science may be defined as one where the uncertainty of its inputs must be suppressed, lest they render its outputs totally indeterminate". The definition, in the book ''[[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;54),&lt;ref name="PNS0"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Funtowicz S, Ravetz J | year = 1990 | title = Uncertainty and quality in science for policy | location = Dordrecht | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | title-link = Uncertainty and quality in science for policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to the loss of craft skills in handling quantitative information, and to the bad practice of achieving precision in prediction (inference) only at the expenses of ignoring uncertainty in the input which was used to formulate the prediction. This use of the term is common among practitioners of [[post-normal science]]. Understood in this way, pseudoscience can be fought using good practices to assesses uncertainty in quantitative information, such as [[NUSAP]] and – in the case of mathematical modelling – [[sensitivity auditing]].

==History==
{{main article|History of pseudoscience}}
The history of pseudoscience is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time. A pseudoscience is a set of ideas that presents itself as science, while it does not meet the criteria to be properly called such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote = Pseudoscientific – pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific |chapter = Pseudoscientific |chapter-url = |title = Oxford American Dictionary |publisher = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url = http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |title = The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter = Pseudoscience |ref = harv |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090201091026/http://www.skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |archivedate = 2009-02-01 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between proper science and pseudoscience is sometimes difficult. One proposal for demarcation between the two is the falsification criterion, attributed most notably to the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. In the [[history of science]] and the [[history of pseudoscience]] it can be especially difficult to separate the two, because some sciences developed from pseudosciences. An example of this transformation is the science [[chemistry]], which traces its origins to pseudoscientific or [[Prescientific|pre-scientific]] study of [[alchemy]].

The vast diversity in pseudosciences further complicates the history of science. Some modern pseudosciences, such as astrology and acupuncture, originated before the scientific era. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. Examples of this ideological process are [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]], which were developed in response to the scientific theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greener M | title = Taking on creationism.

{{See also|List of topics characterized as pseudoscience}}
A topic, practice, or body of knowledge might reasonably be termed pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms.&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"&gt;{{citation | veditors = Cover JA, Curd M |date= 1998 |title= Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues |pages= 1–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Popper stated it is insufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from [[metaphysics]] (such as the philosophical question of what [[existence]] means), by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the [[Empiricism|empirical method]], which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl |name-list-format= vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1963 |title= Conjectures and Refutations |url= http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |ref= harv |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171013124349/http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |archivedate= 2017-10-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.

To demonstrate this point, Popper&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: "that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness.

In contrast, Popper&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted "light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, "If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].

[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.&lt;ref name="Thagard 1978 astrology"/&gt; First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.&lt;ref name="Thagard 1978 astrology"&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science is also distinguishable from revelation, theology, or spirituality in that it offers insight into the physical world obtained by empirical research and testing.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{Cite magazine |first = Stephen Jay |last = Gould | name-list-format = vanc |url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |title = Nonoverlapping magisteria |magazine = Natural History |date = March 1997 |issue= 106 |pages= 16–22 |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170104061453/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |archive-date= January 4, 2017 |ref = harv

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems of belief that derive from divine or inspired knowledge are not considered pseudoscience if they do not claim either to be scientific or to overturn well-established science. Moreover, some specific religious claims, such as [[Studies on intercessory prayer|the power of intercessory prayer to heal the sick]], although they may be based on untestable beliefs, can be tested by the scientific method.

Some statements and common beliefs of popular science may not meet the criteria of science. "Pop" science may blur the divide between science and pseudoscience among the general public, and may also involve science fiction.&lt;ref name=Pendle&gt;{{cite web |first=George |last=Pendle | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm |title=Popular Science Feature – When Science Fiction is Science Fact |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214144307/http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm |archive-date=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, pop science is disseminated to, and can also easily emanate from, persons not accountable to scientific methodology and expert peer review.

If the claims of a given field can be tested experimentally and standards are upheld, it is not pseudoscience, however odd, astonishing, or counterintuitive the claims are. If claims made are inconsistent with existing experimental results or established theory, but the method is sound, caution should be used, since science consists of testing hypotheses which may turn out to be false. In such a case, the work may be better described as ideas that are "not yet generally accepted". ''[[Protoscience]]'' is a term sometimes used to describe a hypothesis that has not yet been tested adequately by the scientific method, but which is otherwise consistent with existing science or which, where inconsistent, offers reasonable account of the inconsistency. It may also describe the transition from a body of practical knowledge into a scientific field.&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;

===Indicators of the possible presence of pseudoscience===

====Use of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims====
* Assertion of scientific claims that are vague rather than precise, and that lack specific measurements&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=211 ''ff''}} (Probability, "Common Blunders")&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of a claim with little or no explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt;
* Failure to make use of [[operational definition]]s (i.e. publicly accessible definitions of the variables, terms, or objects of interest so that persons other than the definer can measure or test them independently){{refn|group=Note|'Most terms in theoretical physics, for example, do not enjoy at least some distinct connections with observables, but not of the simple sort that would permit operational ''definitions'' in terms of these observables. [..] If a restriction in favor of operational definitions were to be followed, therefore, most of theoretical ''physics'' would have to be dismissed as meaningless pseudoscience!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Paul Montgomery |last = Churchland | name-list-format = vanc |title = Matter and Consciousness: A Contemporary Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind|year = 1999 |publisher = MIT Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_7CBvggqOE4C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22operational+definitions.%22+pseudoscience|page = 90 |ref = harv|isbn = 9780262530743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} (See also: [[Reproducibility]]).
* Failure to make reasonable use of the principle of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], i.e. failing to seek an explanation that requires the fewest possible additional assumptions when multiple viable explanations are possible (''see'': [[Occam's razor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=269 ff}}, "Parsimony and Efficiency"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of [[obscurantist]] language, and use of apparently technical jargon in an effort to give claims the superficial trappings of science.
* Lack of boundary conditions: Most well-supported scientific theories possess well-articulated limitations under which the predicted phenomena do and do not apply.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"/&gt;
* Lack of effective [[Scientific control|controls]], such as [[placebo]] and [[double-blind]], in experimental design.
* Lack of understanding of basic and established principles of physics and engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald E. Simanek |url=http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/scipseud.htm |title=What is science? What is pseudoscience? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425202814/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/scipseud.htm |archive-date=2009-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation====
* Assertions that do not allow the logical possibility that they can be shown to be false by observation or physical experiment (''see also'': [[Falsifiability]]).&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lakatos_1970"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lakatos I |date= 1970 |chapter= Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes | veditors = Lakatos I, Musgrave A |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |pages= 91–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims that a theory predicts something that it has not been shown to predict.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=178 ''ff''}} (Deductive Logic, "Fallacies"), and at 211 ''ff'' (Probability, "Common Blunders")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific claims that do not confer any predictive power are considered at best "conjectures", or at worst "pseudoscience" (e.g. ''[[Ignoratio elenchi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, "Fallacies" 174 ''ff'', esp. section on "Ignoratio elenchi"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion that claims which have not been proven false must therefore be true, and vice versa (''see'': [[Argument from ignorance]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, "Fallacies" 174 ''ff'' esp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over-reliance on testimonial, [[anecdotal evidence]], or [[personal experience]]: This evidence may be useful for the context of discovery (i.e. hypothesis generation), but should not be used in the context of [[Theory of justification|justification]] (e.g. [[Statistical hypothesis testing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bunge|1983|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Presentation of data that seems to support claims while suppressing or refusing to consider data that conflict with those claims.&lt;ref name="harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228"/&gt; This is an example of [[selection bias]], a distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data are collected. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect.
* Promulgating to the status of facts excessive or untested claims that have been previously published elsewhere; an accumulation of such uncritical secondary reports, which do not otherwise contribute their own empirical investigation, is called the [[Woozle effect]].&lt;ref name="Gambrill2012"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Eileen Gambrill|title=Critical Thinking in Clinical Practice: Improving the Quality of Judgments and Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsuHtwciwQwC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 May 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-90438-1|page=109|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Evidence of absence|Reversed burden of proof]]: science places the burden of proof on those making a claim, not on the critic. "Pseudoscientific" arguments may neglect this principle and demand that [[skeptic]]s demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a claim (e.g. an assertion regarding the efficacy of a novel therapeutic technique) is false. It is essentially impossible to prove a universal negative, so this tactic incorrectly places the burden of proof on the skeptic rather than on the claimant.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"&gt;Lilienfeld SO (2004) ''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology'' Guildford Press (2004) {{ISBN|1-59385-070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appeals to [[holism]] as opposed to [[reductionism]]: proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, alternative medicine, naturopathy and mental health, often resort to the "mantra of holism" to dismiss negative findings.&lt;ref name="Ruscio"&gt;{{harvp|Ruscio|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of openness to testing by other experts====
* Evasion of peer review before publicizing results (termed "[[science by press conference]]"):&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gitanjali B | title = Peer review -- process, perspectives and the path ahead | journal = Journal of Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 210–4 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11832629 | url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/peerReview.pdf | ref = harv | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623193431/http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/PeerReview.pdf | df =  | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|For an opposing perspective, e.g. [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/ss/ss5.html Chapter 5 of Suppression Stories by Brian Martin] (Wollongong: Fund for Intellectual Dissent, 1997), pp. 69–83.}} Some proponents of ideas that contradict accepted scientific theories avoid subjecting their ideas to peer review, sometimes on the grounds that peer review is biased towards established paradigms, and sometimes on the grounds that assertions cannot be evaluated adequately using standard scientific methods. By remaining insulated from the peer review process, these proponents forgo the opportunity of corrective feedback from informed colleagues.&lt;ref name="Ruscio"/&gt;
* Some agencies, institutions, and publications that fund scientific research require authors to [[Data sharing (Science)|share data]] so others can evaluate a paper independently. Failure to provide adequate information for other researchers to reproduce the claims contributes to a lack of openness.&lt;ref name="Gauch_2003"&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=124 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appealing to the need for secrecy or proprietary knowledge when an [[independent review]] of data or methodology is requested&lt;ref name="Gauch_2003"/&gt;
* Substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all viewpoints is not encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Absence of progress====
* Failure to progress towards additional evidence of its claims.&lt;ref name="Lakatos_1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fredb group=Note/&gt; [[Terence Hines]] has identified astrology as a subject that has changed very little in the past two millennia.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Terence Hines |last= Hines |first= Terence | name-list-format = vanc |title= Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: A Critical Examination of the Evidence |publisher= Prometheus Books |location= Buffalo, NY |date= 1988 |isbn= 978-0-87975-419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Scientific progress]])
* Lack of self-correction: scientific research programmes make mistakes, but they tend to reduce these errors over time.&lt;ref name="Ruscio120"&gt;{{harvp|Ruscio|2001|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ideas may be regarded as pseudoscientific because they have remained unaltered despite contradictory evidence. The work ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky'' (1976) Cornell University, also delves into these features in some detail, as does the work of [[Thomas Kuhn]], e.g. ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1962) which also discusses some of the items on the list of characteristics of pseudoscience.
* Statistical significance of supporting experimental results does not improve over time and are usually close to the cutoff for statistical significance. Normally, experimental techniques improve or the experiments are repeated, and this gives ever stronger evidence. If statistical significance does not improve, this typically shows the experiments have just been repeated until a success occurs due to chance variations.

====Personalization of issues====
* Tight social groups and [[authoritarian personality]], [[suppression of dissent]] and [[groupthink]] can enhance the adoption of beliefs that have no rational basis. In attempting to confirm their beliefs, the group tends to identify their critics as enemies.&lt;ref name="Devilly_437"&gt;{{harvp|Devilly|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims of a conspiracy on the part of the scientific community to suppress the results{{refn|group=Note|e.g. [http://archivefreedom.org/ archivefreedom.org], which claims that "The list of suppressed scientists even includes Nobel Laureates!"}}
* Attacking the motives or character of anyone who questions the claims (see [[ad hominem|Ad hominem fallacy]])&lt;ref name="Devilly_437"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|e.g. [http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/person.html Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic Argumentum Ad Hominem].}}

====Use of misleading language====
* Creating scientific-sounding terms to persuade nonexperts to believe statements that may be false or meaningless: For example, a long-standing hoax refers to water by the rarely used formal name "[[dihydrogen monoxide hoax|dihydrogen monoxide]]" and describes it as the main constituent in most [[poison]]ous solutions to show how easily the general public can be misled.
* Using established terms in idiosyncratic ways, thereby demonstrating unfamiliarity with mainstream work in the discipline

==Explanations==
In a report Singer and Benassi (1981) wrote that pseudoscientific beliefs have their origin from at least four sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Barry |last1= Singer |first2= Victor A. |last2= Benassi | name-list-format = vanc |title= Occult beliefs: Media distortions, social uncertainty, and deficiencies of human reasoning seem to be at the basis of occult beliefs |magazine= American Scientist |volume= 69 |issue= 1 |date= January–February 1981 |pages= 49–55 |jstor= 27850247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common cognitive errors from personal experience.
* Erroneous sensationalistic mass media coverage.
* Sociocultural factors.
* Poor or erroneous science education.

Another American study (Eve and Dunn, 1990) supported the findings of Singer and Benassi and found pseudoscientific belief being promoted by high school life science and biology teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Raymond A. |last1= Eve |first2= Dana |last2= Dunn |name-list-format= vanc |title= Psychic powers, astrology &amp; creationism in the classroom?

===Psychology===
The psychology of pseudoscience attempts to explore and analyze pseudoscientific thinking by means of thorough clarification on making the distinction of what is considered scientific vs. pseudoscientific. The human proclivity for seeking confirmation rather than refutation ([[confirmation bias]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Devilly|2005|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tendency to hold comforting beliefs, and the tendency to overgeneralize have been proposed as reasons for pseudoscientific thinking. According to Beyerstein (1991), humans are prone to associations based on resemblances only, and often prone to misattribution in cause-effect thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beyerstein B, Hadaway P | year = 1991 | title = On avoiding folly | url = | journal = Journal of Drug Issues | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 689–700 | doi=10.1177/002204269002000418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]]'s theory of belief-dependent realism is driven by the belief that the brain is essentially a "belief engine," which scans data perceived by the senses and looks for patterns and meaning. There is also the tendency for the brain to create [[cognitive bias]]es, as a result of inferences and assumptions made without logic and based on instinct — usually resulting in patterns in cognition. These tendencies of [[Apophenia|patternicity]] and agenticity are also driven "by a meta-bias called the [[bias blind spot]], or the tendency to recognize the power of cognitive biases in other people but to be blind to their influence on our own beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shermer |first=Michael |name-list-format=vanc |authorlink=Michael Shermer |date=July 2011 |title=Understanding the believing brain: Why science is the only way out of belief-dependent realism |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-believing-brain/ |journal=Scientific American |access-date=14 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830132644/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-believing-brain/ |archivedate=30 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lindeman states that social motives (i.e., "to comprehend self and the world, to have a sense of control over outcomes, to belong, to find the world benevolent and to maintain one's self-esteem") are often "more easily" fulfilled by pseudoscience than by scientific information.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Furthermore, pseudoscientific explanations are generally not analyzed rationally, but instead experientially.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Operating within a different set of rules compared to rational thinking, experiential thinking regards an explanation as valid if the explanation is "personally functional, satisfying and sufficient", offering a description of the world that may be more personal than can be provided by science and reducing the amount of potential work involved in understanding complex events and outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lindeman&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindeman M | title = Motivation, cognition and pseudoscience | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–65 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9883101 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9450.00085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system encourages one to accept the conclusions they believe, and reject the ones they do not. Further analysis of complex pseudoscientific phenomena require System 2, which follows rules, compares objects along multiple dimensions and weighs options. These two systems have several other differences which are further discussed in the [[Dual process theory|dual-process theory]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The scientific and secular systems of morality and meaning are generally unsatisfying to most people.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Shermer/&gt; --&gt; Humans are, by nature, a forward-minded species pursuing greater avenues of happiness and satisfaction, but we are all too frequently willing to grasp at unrealistic promises of a better life.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael|last1=Shermer|first2=Steven J.|last2=Gould|authorlink1=Michael Shermer | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink2=Stephen Jay Gould|year=2002|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|publisher=Holt Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-7089-7|title-link=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundaries with science==
{{Main article|Demarcation problem}}

In the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and history of science, [[Imre Lakatos]] stresses the social and political importance of the demarcation problem, the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. His distinctive historical analysis of scientific methodology based on research programmes suggests: "scientists regard the successful theoretical prediction of stunning novel facts&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Halley's comet#Computation of orbit|return of Halley's comet]] or the [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|gravitational bending of light rays]]&amp;nbsp;– as what demarcates good scientific theories from pseudo-scientific and degenerate theories, and in spite of all scientific theories being forever confronted by 'an ocean of counterexamples'".&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Lakatos offers a "novel [[fallibilist]] analysis of the development of Newton's celestial dynamics, [his] favourite historical example of his methodology" and argues in light of this historical turn, that his account answers for certain inadequacies in those of [[Karl Popper]] and Thomas Kuhn.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; "Nonetheless, Lakatos did recognize the force of Kuhn's historical criticism of Popper&amp;nbsp;– all important theories have been surrounded by an 'ocean of anomalies', which on a falsificationist view would require the rejection of the theory outright... Lakatos sought to reconcile the [[rationalism]] of Popperian falsificationism with what seemed to be its own refutation by history".&lt;ref name="Bird2008"&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander | last = Bird | chapter = The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science | title = Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science | editor1-first = Stathis | editor1-last = Psillos | editor2-first = Martin | editor2-last = Curd | name-list-format = vanc | location = Abingdon | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | pages = 9, 14 | chapter-format = pdf | chapter-url = http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf | ref = harv | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130601030150/http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf | archivedate = 2013-06-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many philosophers have tried to solve the problem of demarcation in the following terms: a statement constitutes knowledge if sufficiently many people believe it sufficiently strongly. But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;|Imre Lakatos|Science and Pseudoscience}}

The boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and [[scientist]]s, and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordin | first = Michael D. | name-list-format = vanc | article = That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience | editor-last1 = Numbers | editor-first1 = Ronald L. | editor-last2 = Kampourakis | editor-first2 = Kostas | title = Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science | pages = 219–225 | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2015 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pWouCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=newton's+apple+and+other+myths+about+science#v=onepage&amp;q=newton's%20apple%20and%20other%20myths%20about%20science&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780674915473 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history. According to Lakatos, the typical descriptive unit of great scientific achievements is not an isolated hypothesis but "a powerful problem-solving machinery, which, with the help of sophisticated mathematical techniques, digests anomalies and even turns them into positive evidence."&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;

{{quote|To Popper, pseudoscience uses induction to generate theories, and only performs experiments to seek to verify them. To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.&lt;ref name=Newbold&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newbold D, Roberts J | title = An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory | journal = International Journal of Nursing Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 324–30 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18021160 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00646.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Newbold and Julia Roberts|"An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory" in ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 13}} Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |authorlink=Larry Laudan | veditors = Cohen RS, Laudan L |title=Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science|volume=76|year=1983| publisher=D.

{{quote|[Feyerabend] regards Lakatos's view as being closet anarchism disguised as methodological rationalism. It should be noted that Feyerabend's claim was not that standard methodological rules should never be obeyed, but rather that sometimes progress is made by abandoning them. In the absence of a generally accepted rule, there is a need for alternative methods of persuasion. According to Feyerabend, Galileo employed stylistic and rhetorical techniques to convince his reader, while he also wrote in Italian rather than Latin and directed his arguments to those already temperamentally inclined to accept them.&lt;ref name="Bird2008"/&gt;|Alexander Bird|"The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science" in ''Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science''}}

==Politics, health, and education==

===Political implications===
The demarcation problem between science and pseudoscience brings up debate in the realms of science, [[philosophy]] and [[politics]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; --&gt; Imre Lakatos, for instance, points out that the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] at one point declared that [[Mendelian genetics]] was pseudoscientific and had its advocates, including well-established scientists such as [[Nikolai Vavilov]], sent to a [[Gulag]] and that the "liberal Establishment of the West" denies freedom of speech to topics it regards as pseudoscience, particularly where they run up against social mores.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos&gt;{{citation |first= Imre |last= Lakatos | name-list-format = vanc |url= http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/About/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscience.aspx |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725130745/http://richmedia.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/2002_LakatosScienceAndPseudoscience128.mp3 |archive-date= 25 July 2011 |format= mp3 |title= Science and Pseudoscience |page= [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728012423/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/about/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscienceTranscript.aspx (archive of transcript)] |nopp= yes |publisher= The London School of Economics and Political Science, Dept of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method |date= 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It becomes pseudoscientific when science cannot be separated from [[ideology]], scientists misrepresent scientific findings to promote or draw attention for publicity, when politicians, journalists and a nation's intellectual elite [[politicization of science|distort the facts of science for short-term political gain]], or when powerful individuals of the public conflate causation and cofactors by clever wordplay.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Makgoba/&gt; --&gt; These ideas reduce the authority, value, integrity and independence of science in [[society]].&lt;ref name=Makgoba&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makgoba MW | title = Politics, the media and science in HIV/AIDS: the peril of pseudoscience | journal = Vaccine | volume = 20 | issue = 15 | pages = 1899–904 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11983241 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00063-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and education implications===
Distinguishing science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of health care, expert testimony, environmental policies, and science education. Treatments with a patina of scientific authority which have not actually been subjected to actual scientific testing may be ineffective, expensive and dangerous to patients and confuse health providers, insurers, government decision makers and the public as to what treatments are appropriate. Claims advanced by pseudoscience may result in government officials and educators making bad decisions in selecting curricula.{{refn|group=Note|"From a practical point of view, the distinction is important for decision guidance in both private and public life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in a wide variety of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge from its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day society, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various claims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the demarcation issue serious.  For example, creation science may replace evolution in studies of biology."&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"&gt;{{harvp|Hansson|2008|loc= Section 1: The purpose of demarcations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The extent to which students acquire a range of social and [[cognitive]] thinking skills related to the proper usage of science and technology determines whether they are scientifically literate.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Education in the sciences encounters new dimensions with the changing landscape of [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]], a fast-changing culture and a knowledge-driven era.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; A reinvention of the school science curriculum is one that shapes students to contend with its changing influence on human welfare.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Scientific literacy, which allows a person to distinguish science from pseudosciences such as astrology, is among the attributes that enable students to adapt to the changing world.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Its characteristics are embedded in a curriculum where students are engaged in resolving problems, conducting investigations, or developing projects.&lt;ref name=Hurd&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Hurd PD |title=Scientific literacy: New minds for a changing world|journal=Science Education|volume=82|issue=3|pages=407–416|date=June 1998|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199806)82:3&lt;407::AID-SCE6&gt;3.0.CO;2-G}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman mentions why most scientists avoid educating about pseudoscience, including that paying undue attention to pseudoscience could dignify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Efthimiou|2006|p=4}}&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Efthimiou quoting Friedman: "We could dignify pseudoscience by mentioning it at all".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Park emphasizes how pseudoscience can be a threat to society and considers that scientists have a responsibility to teach how to distinguish science from pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Efthimiou|2006|p=4}}&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Efthimiou quoting Park: "The more serious threat is to the public, which is not often in a position to judge which claims are real and which are ''voodoo''. ... Those who are fortunate enough to have chosen science as a career have an obligation to ''inform the public about voodoo science''".&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudosciences such as homeopathy, even if generally benign, are used by charlatans.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; This poses a serious issue because it enables incompetent practitioners to administer health care.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; True-believing zealots may pose a more serious threat than typical con men because of their affection to homeopathy's ideology.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; Irrational health care is not harmless and it is careless to create patient confidence in pseudomedicine.&lt;ref name=Haven&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ncahf.org/pp/homeop.html#haven |author=The National Council Against Health Fraud |title=NCAHF Position Paper on Homeopathy |year=1994 |ref=harv

On December 8, 2016, Michael V. LeVine, writing in ''[[Business Insider]]'', pointed out the dangers posed by the ''[[Natural News]]'' website: "Snake-oil salesmen have pushed false cures since the dawn of medicine, and now websites like ''Natural News'' flood social media with dangerous anti-pharmaceutical, anti-vaccination and anti-GMO pseudoscience that puts millions at risk of contracting preventable illnesses."&lt;ref name=LeVine&gt;{{Citation |last=LeVine |first=Michael |name-list-format=vanc |date=December 8, 2016 |title=What scientists can teach us about fake news and disinformation |publisher=''[[Business Insider]]'' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-fake-news-and-disinformation-pseudoscience-2016-12 |access-date=December 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210131026/http://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-fake-news-and-disinformation-pseudoscience-2016-12 |archivedate=December 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research proposals may be ''solicited'', meaning that they are submitted in response to a request with specified requirements, such as a [[request for proposal]], or they may be ''unsolicited'', meaning they are submitted without prior request. Other types of proposals include "preproposals", where a [[letter of intent]] or brief [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] is submitted for review prior to submission of a full proposal; continuation proposals, which re-iterate an original proposal and its funding requirements in order to ensure continued funding; and renewal proposals, which seek continued sponsorship of a project which would otherwise be terminated.&lt;ref name="uiac"/&gt;

Academic research proposals are generally written as part of the initial requirements of writing a [[thesis]], [[Academic paper|research paper]], or dissertation. They generally follow the same format as a research paper, with an introduction, a [[literature review]], a discussion of research [[methodology]] and goals, and a conclusion. This basic structure may vary between projects and between fields, each of which may have its own requirements.

'''Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego''' is a nonprofit run by the [[University of California, San Diego]]. It was founded as a company in 2001 by [[Sally Ride]], America's first woman in space, along with [[Tam O'Shaughnessy]], Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in [[science, technology, engineering, and math]] (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy.&lt;ref name="aboutus-company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sallyridescience.com/about/|title=Sally Ride Science—About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=change-the-equation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changetheequation.org/commitment-to-excellence/sally-ride-science-inc|title= Change the Equation|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temporal-dynamics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/about/about-sally-ride-science.html|title=Sally Ride Science officially joins TDLC as a corporate partner.|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowler|first1=Matthew|title=Sally Ride Science becomes part of UC San Diego|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/26/sally-ride-science-becomes-part-uc-san-diego/|website=[[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piercey|first1=Judy|last2=Davies|first2=Jennifer|title=Sally Ride Science launches at UC San Diego|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/sally_ride_science_launches_at_uc_san_diego|website=UCSD News|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.

Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs /&gt; The goal is to help educators build students’ STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Existing programs include ''Cool Careers in STEM'', which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students’ interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Guides: Encouraging Girls in Math and Science|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/pubs/practiceguides/20072003.asp|website=National Center for Education Research|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major existing program is ''Key Concepts in Science''. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the [[5E instructional model]], along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students’ STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next Generation Science Standards|url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards|website=[[Next Generation Science Standards]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''science of team science''' ('''SciTS''') field encompasses both conceptual and methodological [[Strategy|strategies]] aimed at understanding and enhancing the processes and outcomes of collaborative, team-based [[research]]. It is useful to distinguish between team science (TS) initiatives and the science of team science (SciTS) field.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stokols | first=Daniel | last2=Hall | first2=Kara L. | last3=Taylor | first3=Brandie K. | last4=Moser | first4=Richard P. | title=The Science of Team Science | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=35 | issue=2 | year=2008 | issn=0749-3797 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.002 | pmid=18619407|pages=S77–S89|url=https://webfiles.uci.edu/dstokols/Pubs/AJPM-Science%20of%20Team%20Science%20Intro.pdf?uniq=-ftp6c5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokols Misra Moser Hall 2008 pp. S96–S115"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stokols | first=Daniel | last2=Misra | first2=Shalini | last3=Moser | first3=Richard P. | last4=Hall | first4=Kara L. | last5=Taylor | first5=Brandie K. | title=The Ecology of Team Science | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=35 | issue=2 | year=2008 | issn=0749-3797 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.003 | pages=S96–S115|url=https://webfiles.uci.edu/dstokols/Pubs/AJPM-Ecology%20of%20Team%20Science.pdf?uniq=-ftp6bz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team science initiatives are designed to promote collaborative, and often cross-disciplinary (which includes multi-, [[interdisciplinary|inter]]-, and transdisciplinary) approaches to answering research questions about particular phenomena. The SciTS field, on the other hand, is concerned with understanding and managing circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of collaborative science, and evaluating the outcomes of collaborative science. Its principal units of analysis are the [[research]], [[training]], and community-based translational initiatives implemented by both public and private sector organizations.

The SciTS field focuses on understanding and enhancing the antecedent conditions, collaborative processes, and outcomes associated with team science initiatives, including their scientific discoveries, educational outcomes, and translations of research findings into new practices, [[Patent|patents]], products, technical advances, and policies.

==History==
Since the 1990s, there has been a growing interest and investment in large-scale, team-based research initiatives to address complex and multifaceted problems that require cross-disciplinary collaboration.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17431139"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wuchty S |author2=Jones BF |author3=Uzzi B | title=The increasing dominance of teams in production of knowledge. | journal=Science | year= 2007 | volume= 316 | issue= 5827 | pages= 1036–9 | pmid=17431139 | doi=10.1126/science.1136099 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=17431139 | bibcode=2007Sci...316.1036W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18845711"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones BF |author2=Wuchty S |author3=Uzzi B | title=Multi-university research teams: shifting impact, geography, and stratification in science. | journal=Science | year= 2008 | volume= 322 | issue= 5905 | pages= 1259–62 | pmid=18845711 | doi=10.1126/science.1158357 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18845711 | bibcode=2008Sci...322.1259J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in team science parallels the increase in specialization among scientists. The rapid growth and accumulation of specialized knowledge in multiple fields has created a substantial need to establish partnerships among scientists and practitioners drawn from several different fields in order to address complex [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[social]], and public [[health]] problems.&lt;ref name="pmid17431139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18845711"/&gt;

The interdiscipline of SciTS initially emerged from practical concerns on the part of funding agencies, which needed to gauge the performance of team science, understand its added value, determine the return on investment of large research initiatives, and inform science policy&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; The term "science of team science" was first introduced in October, 2006, at a conference called The Science of Team Science: Assessing the Value of Transdisciplinary Research, hosted by the [[National Cancer Institute]], in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/scienceteam/index.html National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences Web site.] Accessed May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging SciTS field was further developed in a supplement to the ''[[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]]'', published in July 2008. Two years later, the First Annual International Science of Team Science (SciTS) Conference was held on April 22–24, 2010 in Chicago, Illinois, organized by the [[Northwestern University]] Clinical and Translational Sciences (NUCATS) Institute. The Chicago conference brought together team science investigators and practitioners from a broad range of disciplines, including [[translational science|translational research]]; [[organizational behavior]]; [[Social psychology (psychology)|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[health psychology]]; communications; complex systems; evaluation science; technology; and management.

As a nascent field of inquiry, the terminology, methodologies, and outcomes of SciTS are still being debated and defined, and new hypotheses regarding the most effective strategies for implementing and sustaining team science are beginning to be tested and the results published. While the SciTS literature base is currently limited, the field is founded on a substantial body of knowledge of team research conducted by scholars in diverse fields such as organizational science, community health promotion, and social psychology, as well as from groups outside academia, including business and the military. SciTS research findings are starting to be translated into evidence-based tools and support structures that aim to improve the efficiency and success of team science initiatives.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;

In 2013, the National Academy of Sciences established a National Research Council Committee on the Science of Team Science to evaluate the current state of knowledge and practice in the SciTS field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Science of Team Science | website=National Academies Web Server sites.nationalacademies.org | date=2013-01-11 | url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/BBCSS/CurrentProjects/DBASSE_080231 | ref={{sfnref | National Academies Web Server sites.nationalacademies.org | 2013}} | access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Committee report was published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science p. "&gt;{{cite book | title=Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science | publisher=National Academies Press | publication-place=Washington, D.C. | date=2015-07-15 | isbn=978-0-309-31682-8 | doi=10.17226/19007 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The methods and measures used to evaluate team science are complex and evolving with the interdiscipline of SciTS.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; The definition of a successful team may be different depending on the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]. For example, [[Funding of science|funding agencies]] may be more interested in performance measures related to the translation of team research findings to practical applications, whereas team researchers may use the number of publications produced and amount grant funding obtained to gauge the success of a team science endeavor. In addition, the method of evaluation and metrics of success may vary at different points during the team research project. Short-term measures may include indicators of synergistic output, whereas long-term measures may be related to the impact of the research on the evolution of a discipline or the development of public policy.

SciTS uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the antecedent conditions, collaborative processes, and outcomes associated with team science, as well as the organizational, social, and political context that influences team science.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; These methods include approaches such as surveys, ethnographic observation, case studies, and interviews of members of science teams; [[social network analysis|social network]], mapping and visualization techniques (e.g., graphical representations of collaboration formation and dissolution, geographic distribution of collaborators, funding patterns, patent awards, time to production and commercialization, etc.); and [[bibliometrics|bibliometric]] analyses (e.g., assessment of co-authored papers and grants).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The field would benefit from science agencies and associated policies to put into place advanced computational infrastructures, which will enable the analysis of terabytes of data to identify the factors that contribute to or hinder the success of science teams.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Ideally, evaluation of team science initiatives is performed in real time, during active collaborations, so that the information results can be fed back to the scientific team to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.

==Tools==
Scientists engaged in team science collaborations have traditionally relied on [[heuristics]] to make team science work. Through only their own experiences—what might be called the art of team science—they have tried to discern what facilitates team science and what obstacles stand in the way of a collaboration’s success. By studying the practice of team science, SciTS researchers aim to develop a set of evidence-based tools and recommendations that can then be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of team science initiatives. For example, SciTS researchers may identify approaches to facilitate the formation and function of successful collaborative science teams, remove inter-institutional barriers to team science, support effective collaboration among researchers who work together within a team, and develop team science training programs.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiore SM. Interdisciplinarity as teamwork: how the science of teams can inform team science. ''Small Group Res''. 2008;39:251–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress is being made on a few fronts toward the development of practical tools and recommendations to support the team science process. The SciTS research community is working toward the creation of an evidence base for the development of a set of "effective practices", which can be incorporated into team science training to ensure that the next generation of scientists develops the skills necessary to engage in effective team science. Several groups are developing team science "[[Toolbox|toolboxes]]" or "[[List of toolkits|toolkits]]" that provide resources that can assist researchers with the collaborative science process, including guiding questions that support discussion on collaborative goals and common metrics of success and assigning individual tasks and responsibilities; guidelines for developing a shared "[[language]]" that can be used among researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds; models for communications infrastructure that can support geographically dispersed collaborations; tools for assessing team members' readiness to collaborate; curricula for training team members in skills for team science; and model "[[prenuptial agreements]]" for collaborators that can help to establish agreement on rights to authorship and patents that result from scientific collaborations. Other groups are developing online social networking tools to help scientists identify potential collaborators, and creating centralized databases of measures and instruments that can be used by SciTS researchers, program evaluators, or those who are engaged in team science to assess the processes and outcomes of team science initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Ombudsman.

'''Social science''' is a category of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]], concerned with [[society]] and the [[Social relation|relationships]] among [[individuals]] within a society. Social science as a whole has many branches, each of which is considered a social science. The social sciences include, but are not limited to: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original "science of society", established in the 19th century. For a more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences see: [[Outline of social science]].

[[Positivism|Positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term "[[social research]]" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.

==History==
{{Main|History of the social sciences}}
The history of the social sciences begins in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] after 1650,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|last=Kuper|first=Adam|date=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415108294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw a revolution within [[natural philosophy]], changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was "scientific". Social sciences came forth from the [[moral philosophy]] of the time and were influenced by the [[Age of Revolution]]s, such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; The ''social sciences'' developed from the [[science]]s ([[experimental science|experimental]] and [[applied science|applied]]), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the [[social improvement]] of a [[community|group of interacting entities]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peck1897"/&gt;

The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the [[Encyclopédie|grand encyclopedia of Diderot]], with articles from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The modern period saw "''social science''" first used as a distinct conceptual field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth |year=1824 |author=[[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] (1775–1833)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science was influenced by [[positivism]],&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation was avoided. [[Auguste Comte]] used the term "''science sociale''" to describe the field, taken from the ideas of [[Charles Fourier]]; Comte also referred to the field as ''social physics''.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Comte, the ''social physics'' field was similar to that of [[natural sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this period, there were five paths of development that sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte on other fields.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; One route that was taken was the rise of [[social research]]. Large [[statistical survey]]s were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by [[Émile Durkheim]], studying "social facts", and [[Vilfredo Pareto]], opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which [[social phenomena]] were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as [[Max Weber]]. The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a [[hard science]]. The last path was the [[correlation]] of knowledge and [[Value (ethics)|social values]]; the [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] sociology of [[Max Weber]] firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.

Around the start of the 20th century, [[Enlightenment philosophy]] was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in [[methodology]]. The [[interdisciplinary]] and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vessuri | first1 = H. | doi = 10.1177/0011392102050001010 | title = Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century | journal = Current Sociology | volume = 50 | pages = 135–150 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of [[medicine]], [[sociobiology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]]. Increasingly, [[quantitative research]] and [[qualitative methods]] are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.

In the contemporary period, [[Karl Popper]] and [[Talcott Parsons]] influenced the furtherance of the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see [[consilience]]. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometime distinct in approach toward, the field.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;

The term "social science" may refer either to the specific ''sciences of society'' established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of "noble science" and [[arts]]. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: [[jurisprudence]] and amendment of the [[law]], [[education]], [[health]], [[economy]] and [[trade]], and [[art]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897" /&gt;

Around the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of [[economics]] in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;

The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the [[academic journal]]s in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology|Outline of anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of man", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the social sciences, [[humanities]], and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The ''natural sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], [[Physical Anthropology|physical]] or [[Physical Anthropology|biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (ἄνθρωπος) in [[Ancient Greek]] means "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences."

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist" to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication studies===
{{Main|Communication studies|History of communication studies}}
Communication studies deals with processes of human [[communication]], commonly defined as the sharing of [[symbols]] to create [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face [[conversation]] to mass media outlets such as [[television broadcasting]]. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts. Communication is institutionalized under many different names at different universities, including "communication", "communication studies", "speech communication", "rhetorical studies", "communication science", "[[media studies]]", "communication arts", "[[mass communication]]", "[[media ecology]]", and "communication and media science".

Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a social science, the discipline often overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy, among others. From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). The field applies to outside disciplines as well, including engineering, architecture, mathematics, and information science.

===Economics===
{{Main|Economics|Outline of economics}}
[[Economics]] is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109547?query=Economics&amp;ct= economics – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "economics" is from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶκος}} ''oikos'', "family, household, estate", and νόμος ''nomos'', "custom, law", and hence means "household management" or "management of the state". An [[economist]] is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a [[academic degree|degree]] in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by [[Lionel Robbins]] in 1932, is "the science which studies human behavior as a relation between scarce means having alternative uses". Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no [[economic problem]]. Briefer yet is "the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants" and "the study of the financial aspects of human behavior".
{|align=right
|[[File:Market-Chichicastenango.jpg|thumb|right|Buyers bargain for good prices while sellers put forth their best front in [[Chichicastenango]] Market, [[Guatemala]].]]
|}
Economics has two broad branches: [[microeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and [[macroeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from [[normative economics]], which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve [[Subjectivity|subjective]] value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the [[physiocrats|physiocratic school]]. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as [[public choice theory|politics]], [[law]], [[Experimental economics|psychology]], [[Economic history|history]], [[religion]], marriage and family life, and other social interactions.
This paradigm crucially assumes (1) that resources are scarce because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants, and (2) that "economic value" is willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market (arms' length) transactions. Rival [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] schools of thought, such as [[institutional economics]], [[green economics]], [[Marxist economics]], and [[economic sociology]], make other grounding assumptions. For example, Marxist economics assumes that economics primarily deals with the investigation of [[exchange value]], of which human labour is the source.

The expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker|Becker, Gary S.]] (1976). ''The Economic Approach to Human Behavior''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iwEOFKSKbMgC&amp;dq=%22The+Economic+Approach+to+Human+Behavior%22+Introduction&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 Links] to arrow-page viewable chapter. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education|Outline of education}}
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of world's oldest university, the [[University of Bologna]], in Italy]]
Education [[List of education topics|encompasses]] teaching and learning specific skills, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of knowledge, positive judgement and well-developed wisdom. Education has as one of its fundamental aspects the imparting of culture from generation to generation (see [[socialization]]). To educate means 'to draw out', from the [[Latin]] ''educare'', or to facilitate the realization of an individual's potential and talents. It is an application of [[pedagogy]], a body of theoretical and applied research relating to teaching and learning and draws on many disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachersmind.com/education.htm An overview of education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The education of an individual human begins at birth and continues throughout life. (Some believe that education begins even before birth, as evidenced by some parents' playing music or reading to the baby in the womb in the hope it will influence the child's development.) For some, the struggles and triumphs of daily [[personal life|life]] provide far more instruction than does formal schooling (thus [[Mark Twain]]'s admonition to "never let school interfere with your education"). Family members may have a profound educational effect&amp;nbsp;— often more profound than they realize&amp;nbsp;— though family teaching may function very informally.

===Geography===
{{Main|Geography|Outline of geography}}
[[File:Physical world.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Earth]]
Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. This may involve [[cultural geography]], [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[Health geography|health]], [[Military geography|military operations]], and [[Urban geography|cities]]. The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, [[Oceanography|oceans]], water and [[landforms]] are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="What is geography?"/&gt; [[Physical geography]] examines phenomena related to the [[Geodesy|measurement of earth]]. As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is [[environmental geography]]. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt; Other [[Geography#Branches|branches of geography]] include [[social geography]], [[regional geography]], and [[geomatics]].

Geographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships. The first geographers focused on the science of [[mapmaking]] and finding ways to precisely [[Map projection|project]] the surface of the earth. In this sense, geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences. [[Historical geography]] is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography.

Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to [[Geographic Information Science|GISc]], that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment. The fields of [[urban planning]], [[regional science]], and [[planetology]] are closely related to geography. Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as [[Geographic Information Systems|GIS]], [[remote sensing]], [[aerial photography]], [[statistics]], and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS).

===History===
{{Main|History|Outline of history}}

History is the continuous, systematic narrative and research into past human events as interpreted through historiographical paradigms or theories.

History has a base in both the social sciences and the humanities. In the United States the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] includes history in its definition of [[humanities]] (as it does for applied linguistics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About NEH |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |url=http://www.neh.gov/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] classifies history as a social science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/researchdoc/summary.html Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States: Continuity and Change]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. The [[Social Science History Association]], formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in [[social history]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
{{Main|Law|Outline of law}}
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in London]]
The social science of law, [[jurisprudence]], in common parlance, means a rule that (unlike a rule of [[ethics]]) is capable of enforcement through institutions.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt; However, many laws are based on [[norm (philosophy)|norms]] accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation. The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"/&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"/&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"/&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"/&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''lex''.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
{{Main|Linguistics|Outline of linguistics}}
[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], recognized as the father of modern [[linguistics]]]]
Linguistics investigates the cognitive and social aspects of human language. The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal, such as [[syntax]] (the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences), [[semantics]] (the study of meaning), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the study of the structure of words), [[phonetics]] (the study of speech sounds) and [[phonology]] (the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language); however, work in areas like [[evolutionary linguistics]] (the study of the origins and evolution of language) and [[psycholinguistics]] (the study of psychological factors in human language) cut across these divisions.

The overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] perspective (focusing on language at a particular point in time), and a great deal of it—partly owing to the influence of [[Noam Chomsky]]—aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language. However, language does not exist in a vacuum, or only in the brain, and approaches like contact linguistics, [[Creole language|creole]] studies, [[discourse analysis]], social interactional linguistics, and [[sociolinguistics]] explore language in its social context. Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and [[statistics]] in investigating the frequency of features, while some disciplines, like contact linguistics, focus on qualitative analysis. While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences, other areas, like [[acoustic phonetics]] and [[neurolinguistics]], draw on the natural sciences. Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities, which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Ferdinand Saussure]] is considered the father of modern linguistics.

===Political science===
{{Main|Political science|Outline of political science|Politics}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]] asserted that man is a political animal in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, Alan (2002). Introduction to Political Thinkers. Boston, Massachusetts: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Political science]] is an academic and research discipline that deals with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of [[political system]]s and political behaviour. Fields and subfields of political science include [[political economy]], [[political philosophy|political theory and philosophy]], [[civics]] and [[comparative politics]], theory of [[direct democracy]], apolitical governance, participatory direct democracy, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, [[international relations]], [[foreign policy]], [[international law]], politics, [[public administration]], administrative behaviour, public law, judicial behaviour, and [[Policy|public policy]]. Political science also studies [[power in international relations]] and the theory of [[great powers]] and [[superpower]]s.

Political science is methodologically diverse, although recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the use of the scientific method,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 978-1403934222|title = Rational Choice|last1 = Hindmoor|first1 = Andrew|date = 2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the proliferation of formal-deductive model building and quantitative hypothesis testing. Approaches to the discipline include [[rational choice]], classical political philosophy, [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretivism]], [[structuralism]], and [[behavioralism|behaviouralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], pluralism, and [[Institutionalism in political parties|institutionalism]]. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents, interviews, and official records, as well as secondary sources such as [[scholarly article]]s are used in building and testing theories. Empirical methods include [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]] [[econometrics|or econometrics]], [[case studies]], experiments, and model building. [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] is credited with coining the phrase "political science" while teaching history at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology|Outline of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]] was the founder of [[experimental psychology]].]]
[[Psychology]] is an academic and applied field involving the study of behaviour and mental processes. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental illness]]. The word ''psychology'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ψυχή ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' ("soul", "mind") and ''[[-logy|logy]]'' ("study").

Psychology differs from [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]] in seeking to capture explanatory generalizations about the [[mental function]] and overt behaviour of individuals, while the other disciplines focus on creating descriptive generalizations about the functioning of social groups or situation-specific human behaviour. In practice, however, there is quite a lot of cross-fertilization that takes place among the various fields. Psychology differs from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behaviour, and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of [[neuropsychology]] combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced.
Many people associate psychology with clinical psychology, which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology. In reality, psychology has myriad specialties including social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, [[educational psychology]], industrial-organizational psychology, [[mathematical psychology]], neuropsychology, and quantitative analysis of behaviour.

Psychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole, major block. Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application, others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences. For example, biological psychology is considered a natural science with a social scientific application (as is clinical [[medicine]]), social and occupational psychology are, generally speaking, purely social sciences, whereas neuropsychology is a natural science that lacks application out of the scientific tradition entirely. In British universities, emphasis on what tenet of psychology a student has studied and/or concentrated is communicated through the degree conferred: B.Psy. indicates a balance between natural and social sciences, B.Sc. indicates a strong (or entire) scientific concentration, whereas a B.A. underlines a majority of social science credits. This is not always necessarily the case however, and in many UK institutions students studying the B.Psy, B.Sc, and B.A. follow the same curriculum as outlined by The British Psychological Society and have the same options of specialism open to them regardless of whether they choose a balance, a heavy science basis, or heavy social science basis to their degree. If they applied to read the B.A. for example, but specialized in heavily science-based modules, then they will still generally be awarded the B.A.

===Sociology===
{{Main|Sociology|Outline of sociology}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|[[Émile Durkheim]] is considered one of the founding fathers of sociology.]]
[[Sociology]] is the systematic study of society, individuals' relationship to their societies, the consequences of difference, and other aspects of human [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 218|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the word comes from the suffix "-logy", which means "study of", derived from [[Ancient Greek]], and the stem "soci-", which is from the [[Latin]] word ''socius'', meaning "companion", or society in general.

[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) coined the term, Sociology, as a way to apply natural science principles and techniques to the social world in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the descriptive understanding of the social realm. He proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''The Course in Positive Philosophy'' [1830–1842] and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1844). Though Comte is generally regarded as the "Father of Sociology", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical [[social research]]. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] rejected Comte's positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a ''science of society'' based on [[historical materialism]], becoming recognized as a founding figure of sociology posthumously as the term gained broader meaning. Around the start of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], developed sociological [[antipositivism]]. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular: Durkheimian [[positivism]] and [[structural functionalism]]; Marxist [[historical materialism]] and [[conflict theory]]; and Weberian [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] analysis. American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory, with little Marxist influence, an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology, and a closer association with [[pragmatism]] and [[social psychology]]. In the 1920s, the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] developed [[symbolic interactionism]]. Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the [[Frankfurt School]] pioneered the idea of [[critical theory]], an interdisciplinary form of [[Marxist sociology]] drawing upon thinkers as diverse as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after World War II, influencing [[literary criticism]] and the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School]] establishment of [[cultural studies]].

Sociology evolved as an academic response to the challenges of [[modernity]], such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[secularization]], and a perceived process of enveloping [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-7456-0830-2|0-7456-0830-2]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field generally concerns the [[social rule]]s and processes that bind and separate people not only as [[individual]]s, but as members of [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[Group (sociology)|groups]], [[Community|communities]] and [[social institution|institutions]], and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life. The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short [[Social relation|contacts]] between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of [[globalization|global social processes]]. In the terms of [[Sociology|sociologists]] [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], social scientists seek an understanding of the ''[[Social Construction of Reality]]''. Most sociologists work in one or more [[Subfields of sociology|subfields]]. One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society. For example, [[social stratification]] studies inequality and class structure; [[demography]] studies changes in a population size or type; [[criminology]] examines criminal behaviour and deviance; and [[political sociology]] studies the interaction between society and state.

Since its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of enquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro"/&gt; Sociologists use a diversity of research methods, collect both quantitative and qualitative data, draw upon empirical techniques, and engage [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common modern methods include [[case studies]], [[historiography|historical research]], [[interviewing]], [[participant observation]], [[social network analysis]], [[statistical survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]], and model building, among other approaches. Since the late 1970s, many sociologists have tried to make the discipline useful for purposes beyond the academy. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating public policy, through subdisciplinary areas such as [[evaluation research]], methodological assessment, and [[public sociology]].

In the early 1970s, women sociologists began to question sociological paradigms and the invisibility of women in sociological studies, analysis, and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780300064971|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, feminist sociologists challenged the discipline's [[androcentrism]] at the American Sociological Association's annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socwomen.org/sws-activism/|title=The Founding of SWS|last=Laube|first=Heather|last2=Hess|first2=Bess B.|date=2001|website=Sociologists for Women in Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the founding of the organization Sociologists for Women in Society, and, eventually, a new sociology journal, [[Gender &amp; Society]]. Today, the [[sociology of gender]] is considered to be one of the most prominent sub-fields in the discipline.

New sociological sub-fields continue to appear&amp;nbsp;— such as [[community studies]], [[computational sociology]], [[environmental sociology]], [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[actor-network theory]], gender studies, and a growing list, many of which are [[List of academic disciplines|cross-disciplinary]] in nature.

==Methodology==

===Social research===
{{Main|Social research}}
The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]] can be traced back at least early as the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Halsey (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while some scholars pinpoint the origin of [[demography]] to 1663 with the publication of [[John Graunt]]'s ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality''.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400906 ''The Founder of Statistics''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Social research began most intentionally, however, with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]] in the 19th century.

In contemporary usage, "social research" is a relatively autonomous term, encompassing the work of practitioners from various disciplines that share in its aims and methods. Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena; from [[census]] survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents. The methods originally rooted in classical sociology and statistical mathematics have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as [[political science]], [[media studies]], and [[marketing]] and [[market research]].

Social research methods may be divided into two broad schools:
* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims.
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality.

Social scientists will commonly combine quantitative and qualitative approaches as part of a multi-strategy design. Questionnaires, field-based data collection, archival database information and laboratory-based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used. It is noted the importance of measurement and analysis, focusing on the (difficult to achieve) goal of objective research or [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A [[mathematical model]] uses mathematical language to describe a system. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed 'mathematical modelling' (also modeling). Eykhoff (1974) defined a ''mathematical model'' as 'a representation of the essential aspects of an existing [[system]] (or a system to be constructed) that presents knowledge of that system in usable form'.&lt;ref&gt;Eykhoff, Pieter ''System Identification: Parameter and State Estimation'', Wiley &amp; Sons, (1974). {{ISBN|0-471-24980-7}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-471-24980-7|0-471-24980-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].

These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. The [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. The concept of an ''integrated whole'' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships that are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime. A [[dynamical system]] modeled as a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[formal system|formalization]] has a fixed "rule" that describes the time dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]]. Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers. The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state. The rule is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]]: for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.

Social sciences are criticized for neglecting the moral element of human behavior. Economists tend to focus on self-interest. Clinical psychologists—on the effects of early socialization. Anthropologists tend to assume moral relativism. Sociologists often blame the System for immoral behavior. Socio-biologists tend to assume limited choice behavior. All this, critics hold, contrasts with the fact that life is a constant wrestle between people's moral commitments and urges that pull them to violate these commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Amitai Etzioni. 2017. "The Moral Wrestler: Ignored by Maslow." Society, Volume 54, Issue 6, pp 512–519&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
{{Main|Social theory}}
Other social scientists emphasize the subjective nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Critical theory]] is the examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across social sciences and humanities disciplines.
* [[Dialectical materialism]] is the philosophy of Karl Marx, which he formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel and joining it to the materialism of Feuerbach.
* [[Feminist theory]] is the extension of feminism into theoretical, or philosophical discourse; it aims to understand the nature of gender inequality.
* [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theories]], such as [[Proletarian revolution|revolutionary theory]] and [[Class conflict|class theory]], cover work in philosophy that is strongly influenced by Karl Marx's materialist approach to theory or is written by Marxists.
* [[Phronetic social science]] is a theory and methodology for doing social science focusing on ethics and political power, based on a contemporary interpretation of Aristotelian phronesis.
* [[Post-colonialism|Post-colonial theory]] is a reaction to the cultural legacy of colonialism.
* [[Postmodernism]] refers to a point of departure for works of literature, drama, architecture, cinema, and design, as well as in marketing and business and in the interpretation of history, law, culture and religion in the late 20th century.
* [[Rational choice theory]] is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behaviour.
* [[Social constructionism]] considers how social phenomena develop in social contexts.
* [[Structuralism]] is an approach to the human sciences that attempts to analyze a specific field (for instance, mythology) as a complex system of interrelated parts.
* [[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological paradigm that addresses what social functions various elements of the social system perform in regard to the entire system.

Other fringe social scientists delve in alternative nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Anti-intellectualism|Intellectual critical-ism]] describes a sentiment of critique towards, or evaluation of, intellectuals and intellectual pursuits.
* [[Antiscience|Scientific criticalism]] is a position critical of science and the scientific method.

== Education and degrees ==
Most universities offer degrees in social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson's (Firm&amp;nbsp;: 2006– ). (2007). Peterson's graduate programs in the humanities, arts, &amp; social sciences, 2007. Lawrenceville, New Jersey: Peterson's.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bachelor of Social Science]] is a degree targeted at the social sciences in particular. It is often more flexible and in-depth than other degrees that include social science subjects.{{efn|A [[Bachelor of Social Science]] degree can be earned at the [[University of Adelaide]], [[University of Waikato]] ([[Hamilton, New Zealand]]), [[University of Sydney]], [[University of New South Wales]], [[University of Hong Kong]], [[University of Manchester]], [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]], [[National University of Malaysia]] and [[University of Queensland]].}}

In the United States, a university may offer a student who studies a social sciences field a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, particularly if the field is within one of the traditional [[liberal arts]] such as history, or a BSc: Bachelor of Science degree such as those given by the London School of Economics, as the social sciences constitute one of the two main branches of [[science]] (the other being the [[natural sciences]]). In addition, some institutions have degrees for a particular social science, such as the [[Bachelor of Economics]] degree, though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States.

'''''The Kingdom of Speech''''' is a critique of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] written by [[Tom Wolfe]]. The book's criticisms of Chomsky are outlined in an article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Wolfe, [https://daneverettbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/HarpersMagazine-2016-08-0086105.pdf 'The Origins of Speech: In the beginning was Chomsky']; [https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/2005817/Reviews Buffalo list of reviews].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, Wolfe criticises Darwin and his colleagues for taking partial credit from [[Alfred Wallace]] for the theory of evolution and ignoring Wallace's later work on the theory. Wolfe then criticises Noam Chomsky for dismissing [[Daniel Everett]], who disputes Chomsky's claim that all languages are based ultimately on a hard-wired mechanism known as the [[language acquisition device]] (LAD). Wolfe argues that speech, not evolution, sets humans apart from animals and is responsible for all of humanity's complex achievements.

== Critical response ==

In ''The Guardian'', Steven Poole criticises Wolfe's whole approach to Darwin and dismisses his suggestion {{Citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=unclear that Wolfe believed evolution did/does not occur}} that Darwin had no evidence for his theory of evolution of human speech, saying that Darwin 'adduced a lot of evidence at the time, including the geographical distribution of species, comparative anatomy, fossils and the existence of vestigial organs. Today, of course, evolution is observed in real time in the laboratory, among microbes or insects'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/08/the-kingdom-of-speech-by-tom-wolfe-review Steven Poole, ''The Guardian'', 8/9/16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Washington Post'', [[Jerry Coyne]] agrees that Wolfe 'grossly distorts the theory of evolution'. He also notes that 'Everett didn't slay [Chomsky's theory of] universal grammar: Later linguists found that the [[Pirahã language]] indeed had recursion (e.g., "I want the same hammock you just showed me"). Finally, the technical notion of "recursion" was never the totality of Chomsky's theory anyway. He highlighted the idea in a brief paper in 2003, but his theory always consisted of operations for merging words into bigger and bigger phrases, something no one disputes.' In concluding his review, Coyne states that 'I'm not sure why Wolfe bears such animus against evolution and the use of evidence rather than bluster to support claims about reality. Perhaps his social conservatism has bred such a discomfort with the implications of modern science - that the universe works by natural rather than supernatural or divine laws - that he's compelled to snicker at one of the foundations of modern science: He's called another one, the big bang, "the nuttiest theory I've ever heard."'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/his-white-suit-unsullied-by-research-tom-wolfe-tries-to-take-down-charles-darwin/2016/08/31/8ee6d4ee-4936-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html Jerry A Coyne, ''Washington Post'', 31/8/16].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Times'', Oliver Kamm is equally critical, pointing out that Wolfe doesn't appreciate that Chomsky himself 'is sceptical that the ''language organ'' is a product of natural selection' and that, indeed, some 'scholars believe that Chomsky underestimates the explanatory power of evolutionary theory.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-kingdom-of-speech-by-tom-wolfe-qmwt9p89w Oliver Kamm, ''The Times'', 13/8/16.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Ritchie]] in ''The Spectator'' says 'Wolfe is at his best when describing Chomsky's almost religiously cultish, charismatic hold over linguistics', but that Wolfe's 'version of Chomsky's downfall is as wrong as Chomsky certainly is.'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/08/aged-85-tom-wolfe-discovers-the-key-to-human-progress/ Harry Ritchie, ''The Spectator'', 27/8/16]&lt;/ref&gt; David Z. Morris's in the ''Washington Independent'' points out that Wolfe 'has proven his enduring ability to choose the right moment. Our views of language and human nature are shifting radically and quickly ... ''The Kingdom of Speech'' is traversing the right territory' but he then concludes that the book 'is too loose, too glib, and, in a few places, too glaringly flawed.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/bookreview/the-kingdom-of-speech David Z. Morris, ''Washington Independent Review of Books'', 29/8/16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some contrast to these opinions, Peter York in ''The Sunday Times'', claims that the geneticist [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] admires Wolfe's grasp of both the Darwin literature and the "real weaknesses" of Chomsky's view of language origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/magazine/the-sunday-times-magazine/tom-wolfe-a-man-in-full-660hct53q Peter York, ''The Sunday Times magazine'', 12/8/16]&lt;/ref&gt; While Everett himself has said Wolfe's book is 'the opinion of someone who has looked carefully at the field for years. Some mistakes are likely his fault. Others are the fault of the field for having been unsuccessful in making itself understandable to the public.' (Although Everett has also tweeted that: 'Chomsky's view of [language] origins is nearly identical to Wolfe's view of evol[ution]. Both simplistic.')&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor H. Mair]], [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=26936 ''Language Log''], 24/7/16; [https://twitter.com/amazonrambler/status/774173140289060864 DanielEverett@amazonrambler, 9/9/16].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', Tom Bartlett interviews both Wolfe and Chomsky, and compares and contrasts Wolfe's book with [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|anthropologist Chris Knight's]] more 'in-depth' investigation, ''[[Decoding Chomsky]]: Science and revolutionary politics''. In Bartlett's interview, Chomsky criticises Wolfe saying his 'errors are so extraordinary that it would take an essay to review them.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Chomsky-Puzzle-Piecing/237558 Tom Bartlett, 'The Chomsky Puzzle', ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 25/8/16].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his  review in the journal ''Counterpunch'',  Chris Knight writes that although Wolfe's book is 'awash with screaming errors' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, it is beautifully written and the author is correct to point out that where language is concerned, evolutionary scientists still have little idea as to how it could possibly have evolved. On the other hand, Knight continues, Wolfe gets things bizarrely wrong when he describes Noam Chomsky as a ‘heavyweight evolutionary theorist’. Wolfe seems unaware that throughout his career, Chomsky has consistently opposed Darwin’s view that language gradually evolved. According to Knight, this elementary mistake is a sobering example of Wolfe's hopeless grasp of who adopts which side and why in the various scientific debates about language which he attempts to cover.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Chris Knight, [https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/09/26/the-tom-and-noam-show-a-review-of-tom-wolfes-the-kingdom-of-speech/ 'The Tom and Noam Show'], ''Counterpunch''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John McWhorter]] observed in his ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' review that Wolfe revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of the Chomsky-Everett controversy, and concluded that the author "ultimately misses the essence of the debate from various angles." According to McWhorter's account, Wolfe misidentified both the topic of the discussion (which doesn't revolve around the origin of language, but cognitive mechanisms of language production) and its still inconclusive outcome by wrongly depicting Chomskyan linguists as clear losers and Everett as a "victorious gladiator in this scholarly clash".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/9/14/12910180/noam-chomsky-tom-wolfe-linguist John McWhorter, 'The bonfire of Noam Chomsky: journalist Tom Wolfe targets the acclaimed linguist', ''Vox'', 14/9/16].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sea Around Us''''' is a prize-winning and best-selling book by the American [[marine biologist]] [[Rachel Carson]], first published as a whole by Oxford University Press in 1951. It reveals the science and poetry of the sea while ranging from its primeval beginnings to the latest scientific probings. Often described as "poetic," it was Carson's second published book and the one that launched her into the public eye and a second career as a writer and conservationist; in retrospect it is counted the second book of her so-called sea trilogy.

''The Sea Around Us'' won both the 1952 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]]&lt;ref name=nba1952&gt;

==History==

[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] had published her first book ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'' in 1941; it was reviewed favorably but it sold poorly. Carson initially planned to call the sequel ''Return to the Sea'', and began writing in 1948, just after hiring [[Marie Rodell]] as her [[literary agent]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Carson began by writing a single chapter (what would be "The Birth of an Island") along with a detailed outline, which Rodell used to pitch the book to publishers. During research for the book, Carson met with a number of oceanographers to discuss current research. Carson and Rodell had little initial success with magazines as outlets for the islands chapter, nor for a second chapter titled "Another Beachhead."  In April 1949, with about a third of the chapters complete, Rodell began trying to find a publisher for the entire book. By June she had arranged a contract with [[Oxford University Press]] that promised completion of the manuscript by March 1, 1950. Carson continued to write and research through 1949 and into 1950, despite unexpected health and financial difficulties. In part the research involved a trip aboard a [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] ship, ''Albatross III''. After revising the completion date, Carson completed the manuscript in June 1950. By that time, several periodicals (''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Science Digest]]'', and ''[[The Yale Review]]'') were interested in publishing some of the chapters.&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine of fourteen chapters were serialized in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' beginning on June 2, 1951, and the book was published on July 2 by [[Oxford University Press]].  The serialization created a very large popular response, and the book was the subject of the feature review in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' the day before publication.  One chapter ("The Birth of an Island") was published in ''The [[Yale Review]]''; it won the George Westinghouse Science Writing prize from the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

After the book's release, Carson was inundated with an unexpected volume of [[fan mail]] and media attention.  She was soon the object of attention from "the literary crowd," and because of a subsequent condensation in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', a broad general audience as well.  The book sold more than 250,000 copies in 1951, in addition to the condensation and excerpts published elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

A [[The Sea Around Us (film)|film version]] was filmed in 1952 and released in 1953; it won the 1953 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Best Documentary (though Carson was extremely disappointed with the script and would never sell film rights to her work again).&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vale do Sinos Regional Development Association, VALETEC, was established in 1998 as a non-profit private civil partnership. Its goal is to promote [[Technology|technological development]] in the Vale do Sinos region by stimulating [[regional integration]], providing incentives for entrepreneurship, while creating, attracting, hosting, and developing companies. In order to achieve this goal, VALETEC develops and manages environments for technological innovation, such as incubators, entrepreneurial condominiums, technology parks and complexes, as well as other initiatives aligned with this focus. VALETEC's main commitment is to contribute for the improvement of the Vale do Sinos [[quality of life]], while forging links between educational and research institutions and the society, governments, and companies. This contributes to generate jobs and wealth, boosting the [[sustainable development]] of the Vale do Sinos technopolitan project.

One of VALETEC's main initiatives was the creation of the '''Vale do Sinos Technology Park, VALETEC Park'''. The park currently works as a regional, multicampi and multisector enterprise, with its main axis following the path of highways RS-239 and BR-116, the Innovation Route. The first segment of the VALETEC Park was launched in the city of [[Campo Bom]], in December, 2004. The second segment will consist of an [[urban park]], to be established within the Hamburgo Velho's Historical Center, in the city of [[Novo Hamburgo]]. The park currently encompasses important educational institutions, research centers, labs, companies with intensive focus on knowledge, advanced services, incubators, entrepreneurial centers, facilities for the installation and expansion of companies, living areas and rooms for shared use.

[[Image:VALETEC Futuro2.jpg|right|400px]]

The VALETEC Park is ready to host entrepreneurs, new or consolidated companies and institutions that develop or plan on developing [[clean technology]], applied to the following priority areas: agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and agribusiness; automation and informatics; biotechnology; leather and footwear industry; design; energy; environment; telecommunications; and [[Creative industries|creative economy]]. In the city of Campo Bom, the park segment has capacity for over 120 companies, research centers, scientific and [[economic development]] organizations, and advanced [[service provider]]s. The park's initially encompasses an area of 365,000 m², surrounded by lovely sceneries, a result of our deep respect for the environment. The surroundings have been keeping up with the park's growth. This is the result of the expansion and diversification of existing companies, along with the creation of spaces to host new [[business model]]s and new areas for companies to operate in.

Companies can be installed in the Campo Bom segment of the VALETEC Park under three different modalities: inside the Feevale's [[Business incubator|Technology Incubator]], ITEF, for pre-incubation and incubation; in business accelerators and business condominiums, such as the [[Alberto Santos-Dumont|Alberto Santos Dumont]] Business Center and the Montserrat Business Condominium; and in individual facilities, which companies may choose to either purchase or rent. Feevale is a regional community university (public, yet not [[Public ownership|state-owned]]) which operates in the Campo Bom segment of the VALETEC Park through its Academic Extension Center. This is a space for learning, research and extension activities, with an auditorium, event hall, meeting rooms, restaurant and areas for partners and advanced service providers. In the surroundings of the Academic Extension Center, there are several green preservation areas which make perfect spots for relaxing outdoors, with plenty of shadow to contemplate nature and exercise creativity.

== Innovation Route ==
The Innovation Route represents the VALETEC Park's main axis. It is located along the path of highways RS-239 and BR-116, and its initial project encompasses eight cities. After the Campo Bom segment was established, an opportunity to expand the park was envisioned. This was motivated by the fact that the city's master plan has, since the 1960s, been preserving a minimum of 350 meters on each side of highway RS-239 exclusively for business use. The project received resources from the Research and Projects Financing, FINEP, the Brazilian Innovation Agency, a division of the Ministry of Science and Technology, in order to plan, develop, and implement the [[best practice]]s identified by VALETEC during its international missions. The studies performed made it possible to identify several advantages that ensured the VALETEC Park's success as a regional enterprise.

== Members ==
One of the VALETEC's stylemarks is shared management through a network of alliances. Companies that associate to VALETEC also become members of the VALETEC Park, and have access to a wide range of advantages, such as a relationship network that enables them to develop cooperative projects and receive financial funding for innovation. In addition, members have access to the shared infrastructure and high [[added value]] services, along with the possibility of establishing relationships with associated educational and research institutions.
