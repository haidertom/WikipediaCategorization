'''20th-century Western painting''' begins with the heritage of late-19th-century painters [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and others who were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].

Initially influenced by Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907; see gallery) Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/cubism-the-leonard-lauder-collection ''Cubism: The Leonard A. Lauder Collection'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, 232, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crystal Cubism]] was a distilled form of Cubism consistent with a shift between 1915 and 1916 towards a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes, practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Fernand Léger]] and several other artists into the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of cubism, several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]], where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d’Automne, where his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the surrealist style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was "founded" by [[André Breton]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80419 The Museum of Modern Art, MoMA Highlights, New York, revised 2004, originally published 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century, as Cubism evolved, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]] and [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright|Macdonald-Wright]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] [[architecture]] and [[design]], to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from [[photography]] and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others.

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art [[theorist]], is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]], in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized—as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]]—that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled (as the example in the above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. [[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the theosophical movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism).&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of Paul Klee. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of Kandinsky, Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include [[Czechs|Czech]] painter, [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert.

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read and exaggerated perspectives. A prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]]:

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]]—friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately Matisse became the ''yang'' to Picasso's ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. The Fauves had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''The Green Line'' (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the Fauvist style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rosenthal (publisher)|Tom Rosenthal]], reviewing Derain's London paintings on show at the Courtauld Gallery, ''The Independent'' 4 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MunchDerToddesMarat1907.JPG|thumb|left|[[Edvard Munch]], ''Death of Marat I'' (1907), an example of [[Expressionism]]]]
By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on
the critics radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' William Rubin, published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p.348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Der Blaue Reiter was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]], a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of [[Die Brücke]] were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. This was a seminal group, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], Brücke Museum. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]],'' 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved August 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics encompassing several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern, and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist styles are related to those of both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of [[Expressionist]] and Symbolist painters. Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]],'' (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] [[sculptor]], he made intense expressionist paintings as well.
In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. [[Modernist]] artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. While [[Patrick Henry Bruce]],&lt;ref&gt;Agee and Rose, 1979, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; created [[cubist]] related paintings in Europe, both [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Gerald Murphy]] made paintings that were early inspirations for American [[pop art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl New Yorker article, accessed online November 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and Culture,'' p.464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm accessed online August 28, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017051233/http://jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm |date=October 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marsden Hartley]] experimented with [[expressionism]]. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his New York City gallery ''[[the 291]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/modart_2.shtm National Gallery of Art, retrieved November 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement.

[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became the cause celebre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for [[chess]]) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hopkins|title=Dada and Surrealism: A Very Short Introduction|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly,'' (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zürich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first [[Surrealist]] [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=2008-09-25 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in [[Latin America]], the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'' by Magritte is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its paradox. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bnf.fr/fr/14451967/andre_breton_manifeste_du_surrealisme/ André Breton, ''Manifeste du surréalisme'', various editions], BnF, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018''The Persistence of Memory''] in the MoMA Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."&lt;ref&gt;'André Breton, ''Manifestoes of Surrealism'', transl. Richard Seaver and Helen R. Lane (Ann Arbor, 1971), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Durozoi, History of the Surrealist Movement, transl. Alison Anderson (Chicago, 2002), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Ernst studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings, such as ''Murdering Airplane'' (1920), may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]]''. The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text From the Tate Modern]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new Surrealist painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

[[American Scene painting]] and the [[Social Realism]] and [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self-portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others associated with the [[Berlin Secession]] politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=193 Neue Sachlichkeit, Tate glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public for his 1933 mural, ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other [[communist]] imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian—she was an avowed communist—they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to [[Surrealism]], including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Gernika survived. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

In its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, 3.5 metre (11&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings], retrieved 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia, then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the US until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] (as seen above) in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by [[Edward Hopper]] that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

===Abstract expressionism===

[[Image:No. 5, 1948.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[No. 5, 1948]],'' [[Abstract Expressionism]]]]
[[File:No 61 Mark Rothko.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mark Rothko]], ''[[No. 61 (Rust and Blue)]],'' 1953, 115 cm × 92 cm (45 in × 36 in). [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]]]
The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[The Art of This Century Gallery]], as well as other factors.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and Synthetic Cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1][[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street,'' 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an [[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]].
[[Image:Dugmore-5313 hi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Dugmore]], ''Untitled'', 1954, 84 x 51 inches, San Francisco Bay area school of [[abstract expressionism]]]]
Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early twentieth century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.
Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic [[censorship]] in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.

During the 1950s, Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early to mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea,'' from 1952, a seminal work of [[Colorfield painting]] by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) and [[Art Informel|Informalism]] took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

===Realism, Landscape, Figuration, Still-Life, Cityscape===
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Hopper]], ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942), [[Cityscape]]]]
During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Abstract Expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]] [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', currently in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. This [[tempera]] work, done in a [[realist visual arts|realist]] style, is nearly always on display at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of what may be his friend [[Willem de Kooning]] (left) is an example of the evolution of [[Abstract Expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. In 1952 [[Michel Tapié]] authored the book ''Un Autre art'' which gave name and voice to [[Art Informel|Informalism]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

[[File:Greencocacola.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andy Warhol]], 1962, [[Pop Art]]]]

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for Pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in his best known works, such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83. (''Drowning Girl'' now is in the collection of [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]].&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Also featuring thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Sidney Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 a historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of Pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] [[work of art]] that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring 20&amp;nbsp;inches in height x 16&amp;nbsp;inches in width (50.8 x 40.6&amp;nbsp;cm) and each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in [[Pop art]] as a major [[art movement]] that relied on themes from [[popular culture]]. These works by [[Andy Warhol]] are repetitive and they are made in a non-painterly commercial manner.

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', p.119-122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by W.W.Norton and Company, NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of [[David Hockney]] whose paintings emerged from England during the 1960s like ''[[A Bigger Splash]],'' and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.

While in the downtown scene in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction and seen in ordinary [[comic books]] and in paintings like ''Drowning Girl'', 1963, in the gallery above. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1,'' 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in [[California]]. Although throughout the 20th-century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Neo-Dada is a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Colorfield painting]], and [[Minimal Art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.


[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton, online essay about [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[acrylic paint]], [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials] accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and [[Al Held]] are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. [[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the Minimalism of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Bridget Riley]] and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.
Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Color Field painting clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Morris Louis]] and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat''is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. From 1960 [[Frank Stella]] produced paintings in [[aluminum]] and [[copper]] paint and are his first works using [[shaped canvas]]es (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (67), for example. Also in the 1960s, Stella began to use a wider range of colors, typically arranged in straight or curved lines. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (71) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''. These paintings are named after circular cities he had visited while in the Middle East earlier in the 1960s. The Irregular Polygon canvases and Protractor series further extended the concept of the [[shaped canvas]].

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web] retrieved June 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth Art]], [[Video]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of [[Fluxus]], Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal Art]], Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, Newsweek 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] shares similarities with Color Field painting and Abstract Expressionism especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in Abstract Expressionism and Color Field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from Abstract Expressionism and Action Painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in Action Painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight'' (above), there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.
During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], [[Mino Argento]] and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

===Monochrome, minimalism, postminimalism===

Kelly was a pioneer of [[hard-edge painting]] in the 1940s and 1950s.]]

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman,  Jim Long, ''George Ortman''], The Brooklyn Rail, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.

This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

===Neo-expressionism===
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/philip-guston-1231 Philip Guston, the Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm the art story, neo=expressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 Tate online glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1990s the [[Stuckists]], a group that emerged late in 1990s respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2,'' 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Plagens, Peter. ''A Matter of Horsepower'', ''Newsweek'', Retrieved June 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503-504&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Damien Hirst]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">'''American political development''' (often abbreviated as '''APD''') is a subfield of [[political science]] that studies the historical development of [[politics in the United States]]. In American political science departments, it is considered a subfield within [[American political science|American politics]] and is closely linked to [[historical institutionalism]].

Scholarship in American political development focuses on "the causes, nature, and consequences of key transformative periods and central patterns in American political history."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersh|first=Rogan|date=2005-01-01|title=The Growth of American Political Development: The View from the Classroom|jstor=3688034|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=335–345|doi=10.1017/s1537592705050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Orren]] and [[Stephen Skowronek]], co-founders of the subfield's [[Studies in American Political Development|flagship journal]], define American political development as the study of "durable shifts in governing authority" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Search-American-Political-Development/dp/0521547644|title=The Search for American Political Development|date=2004-05-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521547642|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield emerged within [[American political science]] in the 1980s, alongside a general renewal of work in [[historical institutionalism]], as an "insurgent movement" that sought to refocus attention on the study of historical American politics and to use such historical study to recast the study of contemporary political phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-21|chapter=Distinctiveness and Necessity of American Political Development |title=Oxford Handbook of American Political Development| editors=Richard M.

APD shares overlaps with the research agendas of [[comparative politics]] (particularly [[Comparative historical research|comparative historical analysis]]), [[historical sociology]], and [[political history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/research/department-strengths/american-political-development.html|title=American Political Development: Department of Political Science - Northwestern University|website=www.polisci.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarship in APD differs from political history in that the former's "primary concerns are analytical, conceptual, and theoretical rather than historical."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-36|title=Qualitative Methods and American Political Development|last=Galvin|first=Daniel J.|date=2015-07-09|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.013.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodologically, the subfield tends to use within-case analysis and conduct causes-of-effects research (as opposed to effects-of-causes research).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Major journals in the subfield include the flagship journal ''[[Studies in American Political Development]]'', founded in 1986, and ''The Journal of Political History'', founded in 1989. As of 2005, the Politics and History section (founded in 1989) of the [[American Political Science Association]] was the eighth-largest in membership out of 35 total sections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/section24|title= MEMBERSHIP &gt; Organized Sections by Title &gt; Politics and History (Section 24)|website=American Political Science Association|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applied linguistics''' is an interdisciplinary field of linguistics which identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied [[linguistics]] are [[education]], [[psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication research]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]].

{{Linguistics}}

== Domain ==
Applied linguistics is an [[interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary field]] of linguistics. Major branches of applied linguistics include [[bilingualism]] and [[multilingualism]], [[conversation analysis]], [[contrastive linguistics]], [[Sign language#Linguistics of sign|sign linguistics]], [[language assessment]], [[literacy|literacies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[language pedagogy]], [[second language acquisition]], [[language planning]] and [[language policy|policy]], [[interlinguistics]], [[stylistics (literature)|stylistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[forensic linguistics]] and [[translation]].

== Journals ==
Major journals of the field include ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]'', ''Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''European Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''Issues in Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]]'', ''Language and Education, TESOL Quarterly'', and ''Linguistics and Education''.

== History ==
The tradition of applied linguistics established itself in part as a response to the narrowing of focus in linguistics with the advent in the late 1950s of [[generative linguistics]], and has always maintained a socially-accountable role, demonstrated by its central interest in language problems.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the field of applied linguistics started from Europe and the United States, the field rapidly flourished in the international context.

Applied linguistics first concerned itself with principles and practices on the basis of linguistics. In the early days, applied linguistics was thought as “linguistics-applied” at least from the outside of the field. In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment, [[language policy]], and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than [[theoretical linguistics]], including the solution of language-related problems in the real world. By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to  "the theoretical and empirical investigation of real world problems in which language is a central issue."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Brumfit. How applied linguistics is the same as any other science, "International Journal of Applied Linguistics", 7(1), 86-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, applied linguistics also began narrowly as the application of insights from structural linguistics—first to the teaching of English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The ''linguistics applied'' approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who developed the foundation for the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1941. In 1946, Applied linguistics became a recognized field of studies in the aforementioned university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/applied-linguistics|title=Applied Linguistics {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established ''Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics'', the first journal to bear the term ''applied linguistics.'' In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Margie Berns and Paul Kei Matsuda. 2006. Applied linguistics: Overview and history. In K. Brown (Ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of language and linguistics'' (2nd ed.), 398-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==
The [[International Association of Applied Linguistics]] was founded in France in 1964, where it is better known as Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée, or AILA. AILA has affiliates in more than thirty countries, some of which are listed below.

'''Australia'''
Australian applied linguistics took as its target the applied linguistics of mother tongue teaching and teaching English to immigrants. The Australia tradition shows a strong influence of continental Europe and of the USA, rather than of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (ALAA) was established at a national congress of applied linguists held in August 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alaa.org.au/ | title = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (home page) | date = September 2011 | publisher = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALAA holds a joint annual conference in collaboration with the Association for Applied Linguistics in New Zealand (ALANZ).

'''Canada'''
The Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics / L’Association canadienne de linguistique appliquée (CAAL/ACLA), is an officially bilingual (English and French) scholarly association with approximately 200 members. They produce the ''Canadian Journal of Applied Linguistics'' and hold an annual conference.&lt;ref name="ACLA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.aclacaal.org/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ireland'''
The [[Irish Association for Applied Linguistics]]/Cumann na Teangeolaíochta Feidhmí (IRAAL) was founded in 1975. They produce the journal ''Teanga'', the Irish word for 'language'.&lt;ref name="IRAAL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Association for Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.iraal.ie/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japan'''
In 1982, the Japan Association of Applied Linguistics (JAAL) was established in the Japan Association of College English Teachers (JACET) in order to engage in activities on a more international scale. In 1984, JAAL became an affiliate of the International Association of Applied Linguistics (AILA).[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202550/http://www.jacet.org/about-e.html]

'''New Zealand'''
The Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand (ALANZ) produces the journal ''New Zealand Studies in Applied Linguistics'' and has been collaborating with the Applied Linguistics Association of Australia in a combined annual conference since 2010, with the Association for Language Testing and Assessment of Australia and New Zealand (ALTAANZ) later joining the now three-way conference collaboration.&lt;ref name="ALANZ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand| url=http://alanz.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''South Africa'''
The Southern African Applied Linguistics Association (SAALA) was founded in 1980. There are currently four publications associated with SAALA including the ''Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies Journal'' (SAJALS).&lt;ref name="SAALA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern African Applied Linguistics Association| url=http://www.saala.org.za/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''
The [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]] (BAAL) was established in 1967. Its mission is "the advancement of education by fostering and promoting, by any lawful charitable means, the study of language use, language acquisition and language teaching and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration in this study [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.baal.org.uk/constitution.pdf | title = British Association for Applied Linguistics constitution | at = Paragraph 3: "Objects" | work = Public Documents  | date = September 2011  | publisher = British Association for Applied Linguistics | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAAL hosts an annual conference, as well as many additional smaller conferences and events organised by its Special Interest Groups (SIGs). 

'''United States'''
The [[American Association for Applied Linguistics]] (AAAL) was founded in 1977. AAAL holds an annual conference, usually in March or April, in the United States or Canada.

A '''Biblical [[genre]]''' is a classification of Bible literature according to [[literary genre]]. The genre of a particular [[Bible]] passage is ordinarily identified by analysis of its general writing style, [[setting tone|tone]], form, structure, [[literary technique]], content, design, and related linguistic factors; texts that exhibit a common set of literary features (very often in keeping with the writing styles of the times in which they were written) are together considered to be belonging to a genre. In Biblical studies, genres are usually associated with whole books of the Bible, because each of its books comprises a complete textual unit; however, a book may be internally composed of a variety of styles, forms, and so forth, and thus bear the characteristics of more than one genre (for example, chapter 1 of the [[Book of Revelation]] is prophetic/visionary; chapters 2 and 3 are similar to the epistle genre; etc.).

Within the discipline of literary analysis, the existence and subjectivity of genres is a matter of some debate. This is reflected to a lesser degree in academic discussion of Biblical genres. However, isolating the broad genres of the Bible and discerning which books/passages belong to which genre is not a matter of complete agreement; for instance, scholars diverge over the existence and features of such Bible genres as [[gospel]] and [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]]. Furthermore, some detect subgenres&amp;mdash;more narrowly defined compositional categories within a genre&amp;mdash;in surrounding historical literature, and speculate that certain books and passages of the Bible may be better denominated by subgenre (e.g., it may be claimed that the book of Philemon is not simply a generic letter, but a ''personal'' letter). Despite such differences of opinion within the community of Bible scholars, the majority acknowledge that the concept of genre and subgenre can be useful in the study of the Bible as a guide to the tone and interpretation of the text.

By way of literary comparison with the Bible, the Qur'an is claimed to be a recitation by Allah to the prophet Muhammed in didactic form, and so does not have the degree of genre diversity that is evidenced in the Bible; although there is a difference in style and themes between the Meccan surrahs and the Medinan surrahs when Muhammed moved from Mecca to Medina. In contrast, the Bible is claimed to be inspired by a supreme being and organically written and compiled by many authors over a very long period of time, and so takes a wide variety of forms.

[[File:The early paintings and drawings of John Constable cover.jpg|thumbnail|A volume from [[Graham Reynolds (art historian)|Graham Reynolds]]'s ''catalogue raisonné'' of [[John Constable]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Graham. ''The Early Paintings and Drawings of John Constable'', (London: [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale University Press]], 1996) {{ISBN|9780300063370}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''''catalogue raisonné''''' is a comprehensive, annotated listing of all the known [[Visual arts|artworks]] by an [[artist]] either in a particular medium or all media.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nypl.org/node/29583 What is a Catalogue Raisonné?]", ''New York Public Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; The works are described in such a way that they may be reliably identified by third parties.

There are many variations, both broader and narrower than "all the works" or "one artist". The parameters may be restricted to one type of art work by one artist or widened to all the works by a group of artists.

It can take many years to complete a ''catalogue raisonné'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' |title=One Art Lover’s Crusade To Catalog The World |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-art-lovers-crusade-to-catalog-the-world/ |first=Oliver |last=Roeder |date=August 17, 2017 |quote=Such a catalog can itself represent the life’s work of the scholar who compiles it. It took Jacob-Baart de la Faille 11 years to complete van Gogh’s catalog. Monet’s catalog was published over a span of 18 years by a French billionaire. And it took 46 years for all of Picasso’s catalog to be released, while its publisher sold his car and apartment to finance the project.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large teams of researchers are sometimes employed on the task. For example, it was reported in 2013 that the Dedalus Foundation (established by the abstract-expressionist painter [[Robert Motherwell]]) took 11 years to complete the three-volume catalogue raisonné of Motherwell’s work which was published by Yale University Press in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Flam, J.; Rogers, K.; and Clifford, T. (2012). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929215632/http://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?K=9780300149159 |date=29 September 2014 |title=Robert Motherwell Paintings and Collages: A Catalogue Raisonné 1941–1991}}. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|9780300149159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 25 people contributing to the project.&lt;ref&gt;Boroff and Kazakina (2013).

Early examples consisted of two distinct parts, a biography and the catalogue itself. Their modern counterpart is the critical catalogue which may contain personal views of the author.&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"/&gt;

==Name==

The term ''catalogue raisonné'' is French, meaning "reasoned catalogue"&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catalogue+raisonne Catalogue raisonné]", ''Online Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. containing arguments for the information given, such as attributions), but is part of the [[technical terminology]] of the English-speaking art world. The spelling is never Americanized to "catalog", even in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Car.html |title=Car-Caz |website=ArtLex.com |date=13 July 2007 |access-date=26 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713171515/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Car.html |archive-date=13 July 2007 |quote=Although 'catalogue raisonné' was originally a French term, English speakers have used it for a long time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAQ, placing the Catalogue Raisonné in context with other types of art catalogues: {{cite web |url=http://arthistory.about.com:80/od/artspeak_faqs/f/catalogue.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909211530/http://arthistory.about.com:80/od/artspeak_faqs/f/catalogue.htm |archive-date= 9 September 2017 |title=
What Is a Catalogue? |website=ArtHistory.About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French pluralization "catalogues raisonnés" is used.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;{{efn|As seen in the CRSA homepage, [http://www.catalogueraisonne.org/ catalogueraisonne.org].}}

==Role in authentication of artistic work==
''[[The New York Times]]'' has described catalogues raisonnés as the definitive, scholarly compendia of an artist's work, the "supreme arbiter of the genuine and fake".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, Patricia (19 June 2012). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/arts/design/art-scholars-fear-lawsuits-in-declaring-works-real-or-fake.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 In Art, Freedom of Expression Doesn't Extend to 'Is It Real?']", ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of deceased artists the producer of a catalogue raisonné which is regarded as a standard text may have considerable power to determine whether a particular work is regarded as authentic or not.{{efn|[[Wildenstein Index Number]]}} In this context "producers" may include authors, editors, committees or publishers.

Inclusion in or exclusion from a respected catalogue raisonné can have a considerable effect on the market price of a work, amounting in some cases to large sums of money. Inclusion has been called the difference between "great wealth and the gutter",&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; and auction houses sometimes refuse to handle unlisted works.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"/&gt; As a result, catalogue raisonné authors have been the targets of lawsuits, and allegedly of bribes and even death threats&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"&gt;Cohen, Patricia (2 February 2014). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/arts/design/a-modigliani-who-says-so.html?ref=design&amp;_r=2 A Modigliani? Who Says So?]", ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; although no evidence of the latter has reached the courts.

In an edition of the television programme in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2011, the subject was the authenticity of the [[Claude Monet|Renoir]]  painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]''. The painting was submitted to the [[Wildenstein Institute]] which is the publisher of the catalogues raisonnés&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223132505/http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-publications-liste&amp;lang=en |title="Catalogue of Publications", ''Wildenstein Institute'' |date=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most widely accepted as [[Wildenstein Index Number|authoritative]] on the subject of Renoir paintings. The result of this submission was that the Institute, acting in accordance with the wishes of a descendant of the original author of the catalogues, refused to include it in future editions. This decision was taken despite the fact that the Institute had been presented with considerable evidence of the painting's authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3936:fake-or-fortune?-episodes-1-2-bbc1&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713074928/https://theartsdesk.com/?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3936%3Afake-or-fortune%3F-episodes-1-2-bbc1&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-date=13 July 2018 |title=Reviews |publisher=The Arts Desk |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}{{verify source|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this decision the edition of the programme broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2014 investigated one of a [[The Grand Teddy tea-rooms paintings|group of paintings]] reputedly by French post-impressionist [[Édouard Vuillard]] and on this occasion a committee of the Wildentstein Institute decided that the painting should be included in their catalogue raisonné for the artist.&lt;ref name="Huff vuillard"&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Painting Bought For £3,000 On Ebay Actually Worth A Fortune |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/20/ebay-painting-fortune_n_4630252.html |accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art dealer and historian [[Philip Mould]] stated while presenting the programme that this painting would be worth approximately £250,000 if it was accepted for inclusion in the catalogue raisonné, but that if it was not accepted it would be worth approximately £1,500 'as a piece of decorative art' – less than 1% of the full value.&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed from BBC iPlayer: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03rmbqc ''Fake or Fortune?'' S3 E1/4: "Vuillard"], ''BBC.co.UK''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the ''New York Times'' reported that some scholars and artists' foundations have decided not to publish future catalogues raisonnés because they fear being sued by buyers or sellers unhappy with their conclusions.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"/&gt; The question of whether producers of catalogues raisonnés should accept responsibility for determining authenticity of works was debated at a seminar on 29 March 2012 held at Christies, New York under the auspices of the Catalogue Raisonné Scholars Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222195618/http://www.catalogueraisonne.org/programs/programs.html |title="Programs", ''Catalogue Raisonne Scholars Association'' |date=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of individual policies is given by the Wildenstein Institute's stated policy with regard to authentication of artworks which (at 8 February 2014) was as follows: 'After examination, and based on the opinion of the members of the committee, a recommendation is made in the form of the intention to include or not to include the work under study; a third possibility also exists, that of continuing the examination of the work. Under no circumstance is a recommendation to be considered as a certificate of authenticity or appraisal, and no justification will be provided for said recommendation.’&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-catalogue-raisonne-catalogue-critique&amp;lang=en |title=Catalogue Raisonné, Critical Catalogue |website=Wildenstein Institute |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223131620/http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-catalogue-raisonne-catalogue-critique&amp;lang=en |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy contrasts with the text of the letter from the Institute which was read out on the television programme about the Monet painting, in which the Institute appeared to reject the authenticity of the work.

Difficulties can occur when more than one catalogue raisonné is published for the same oeuvre. The work of the artist [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] is the subject of at least five catalogues raisonnés.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Gareth (2013). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404042512/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Modigliani-Institute-president-arrested/28490 |title="Modigliani Institute president arrested", ''The Art Newspaper'' |date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of paintings ===

Even if there is no published catalogue raisonné for an artist there may be an organisation which publishes authentications of work which are regarded as having the same effect as a formal catalogue. In the edition of ''Fake or Fortune?'' first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2014, an example of such a committee was featured. The subject of the programme was a painting which bore a signature reading "[[Marc Chagall]]" thus implying that it had been painted by the Russian-French artist of that name. It had been included in a reference work on the painter, but not in the most recent edition of that work, and forensic tests showed that it was painted with pigments not available at the time it was purported to have been executed. Despite this uncertain evidence of authenticity the makers of the programme submitted it to a group referred to as the "Chagall Committee", which includes descendants of the artist. This committee ruled that the painting is a fake and sought its destruction either with the agreement of the owner or, failing that, by court order under the French law of [[Droit moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya (1 February 2014). "[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/01/chagall-could-be-furnt-fortune-or-fake The man whose 'real Chagall' could now be burnt as a fake], ''Guardian.com'' (2014/02/01).&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian Dr [[Bendor Grosvenor]] criticised the Chagall Committee's decision to seek the destruction of the painting, &lt;ref&gt;(2014). "[http://www.arthistorynews.com/articles/2641_Mon_Dieu__le_feu_ctd Mon Dieu - le feu! (ctd.)]", ''Art History News''.&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the policy of the Wildenstein Institute when works are submitted to it: 'Whatever the committee's recommendation, the work will be returned upon presentation of the consignment receipt'.&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"/&gt; Presenter and art dealer [[Philip Mould]] said "I would now [think] three times or more before sending it to Paris. Ugly acts like the one proposed by the Committee can have the effect of damaging the progress of art history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10612704/Philip-Mould-burning-fake-paintings-could-damage-art-history.html |title=Burning fake paintings could damage art history |first=Philip |last=Mould |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2 Feb 2014 |accessdate=9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5509">'''Categories for the Description of Works of Art''' ('''CDWA''') describes the content of art databases by articulating a conceptual framework for describing and accessing information about works of art, architecture, other material culture, groups and collections of works, and related images. The CDWA includes 532 categories and subcategories. A small subset of categories are considered core in that they represent the minimum information necessary to identify and describe a work. The CDWA includes discussions, basic guidelines for cataloging, and examples. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/introduction.html CDWA Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Categories provide a framework to which existing art information systems can be mapped and upon which new systems can be developed. In addition, the discussions in the CDWA identify vocabulary resources and descriptive practices that will make information residing in diverse systems both more compatible and more accessible. 

The use of the CDWA framework will contribute to the integrity and longevity of data and will facilitate its inevitable migration to new systems as informational technology continues to evolve. Above all, it will help to give end-users consistent, reliable access to information, regardless of the system in which it resides. 

These guidelines hopefully provide a common ground for reaching agreement on what information should be included in art information systems, and what information will be shared or exchanged with other institutions or systems. Target users are curators, registrars, researchers, information managers, and systems vendors.

==History==
The CDWA is a product of the Art Information Task Force (AITF), which encouraged dialog between art historians, art information professionals, and information providers so that together they could develop guidelines for describing works of art, architecture, groups of objects, and visual and textual surrogates. 

Formed in the early 1990s, the task force was made up of representatives from the communities that provide and use art information: art historians, museum curators and registrars, visual resource professionals, art librarians, information managers, and technical specialists. The work of the AITF was funded by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], with a two-year matching grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) to the [[College Art Association]] (CAA).

==CDWA Lite== &lt;!-- [[Lightweight Information Describing Objects]] redirects here --&gt;
[[ARTstor]], the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], and RLG Programs/[[OCLC]] have worked together to develop an XML schema to describe cultural materials and their surrogates to provide an easier and more sustainable model for contributing to union resources. This initiative was driven by the absence of a data content standard specifically designed for unique cultural works, and a technical format for expressing this data in a machine-readable format.

CDWA Lite is an XML schema to describe core records for works of art and material culture based on CDWA and the Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) content standard. CDWA Lite records are intended for contribution to union catalogs and other repositories using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) harvesting protocol. The CDWA Lite schema has been enlarged and integrated into the [[LIDO|Lightweight Information Describing Objects (LIDO)]] schema, which is available on the CIDOC site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA)|url=https://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Intercultural Dialogue''' ('''CID''') was established by the [[Council of Communication Associations]] (CCA) in March 2010.&lt;ref name="CCA March 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Council of Communication Associations Minutes for March 2010|url=https://communicationassociations.wordpress.com/history/minutes/march-2010/|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W.

The CID is creating an international network, including both scholars and practitioners.&lt;ref name="Witteborn 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Witteborn|first=Saskia|title=The Center for Intercultural Dialogue: Creating scholarly community, merging theory and practice|work=Paper presented at the International Communication Association Annual Convention, 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CID broadly represents scholars in the discipline of Communication, but has a specific mandate to directly serve those who are members of any member associations of CCA. As of 2016, these include:

* [[American Journalism Historians Association]]
* [[Association for business communication|Association for Business Communication]]
* Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communication
* Black College Communication Association
* [[Broadcast Education Association]]
* [[International Communication Association]]
* National Association for Media Literacy Education

When CID was founded in 2010, two other associations were members: 
* [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]
* [[National Communication Association]]

== History ==

The CID was created as a direct result of the [[National Communication Association]]'s Summer Conference on Intercultural Dialogue, held in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], July 22–26, 2009.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carbaugh|first=Donal|title=On dialogue studies|journal=Journal of Dialogue Studies|year=2013|volume=2|issue=1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Prue|title=Intercultural dialogue: Challenges to theory, practice, and research|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|year=2014|volume=14|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Wendy Leeds-Hurwitz, in her role as Chair of the International and Intercultural Communication Division of [[National Communication Association|NCA]], served as conference organizer, and Nazan Haydari, based at Maltepe University in [[Istanbul]], served as local arrangements coordinator.&lt;ref name="Monaghan 2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=The handbook of intercultural discourse and communication|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|page=26|author=Leila Monaghan|editor=C.

Rangel|chapter=Perspectives on intercultural discourse and communication.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the organizing committee were Donal Carbaugh ([[United States|US]]), Tamar Katriel ([[Israel]]), Kristine Fitch Muñoz ([[United States|US]]), [[:fr:Yves Winkin|Yves Winkin]] ([[France]]), and Saskia Witteborn ([[Hong Kong]]).&lt;ref name="Spectra 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=National Communication Association|title=NCA is going to Istanbul|journal=Spectra|year=2008|volume=44|issue=11|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Support for the conference was provided by both [[National Communication Association|NCA]] and [[Maltepe University]].&lt;ref name="NCA Programs"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCA Programs|url=http://www.natcom.org/NCAPrograms/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrice Buzzanell]] (2011) describes one of the plenary presentations in some detail,&lt;ref name="Buzzanell 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buzzanell|first=Patrice|title=Interrogating culture|journal=Intercultural Communication Studies|year=2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leeds-Hurwitz (2015) provides a detailed description of the unusual conference design&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2015). Facilitating intercultural dialogue through innovative conference design. In N. Haydari &amp; P. Holmes (Eds.), Case studies in intercultural dialogue (pp. 3-22). Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Summer Conference resulted in a preconference at the [[International Communication Association]] convention in [[Singapore]] in 2010, organized by Evelyn Ho.&lt;ref name="Ho 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ho|first=Evelyn|title=Preconference on Intercultural Dialogue: In Singapore or From Your Own Home..|journal=ICA Newsletter|date=June 2010|volume=38|issue=5|url=http://www.icahdq.org/members/MembersNewsletter/JUN10_HOPRECONFERENCE.asp|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first publication resulting from the presentations appeared in 2011, in a special issue of the ''Journal of International and Intercultural Communication'', edited by Prue Holmes and Shiv Ganesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganesh|first=S|author2=Holmes, P.|title=Culture, communication, and peacebuilding: A reflexive  multi-dimensional contextual framework|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|year=2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=245–269|doi=10.1080/17513057.2012.716858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An edited collection resulting from the Istanbul conference appeared in 2015, edited by Haydari and Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;Haydari, N., &amp; Holmes, P.

Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt.&lt;/ref&gt; Broome &amp; Collier (2012)&lt;ref name="Broome &amp; Collier"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broome|first=B.|author2=Collier, M. J.|title=Culture, communication, and peacebuilding: A reflexive multi-dimensional contextual framework|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|year=2012|volume=4|issue=2|pages=81–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;  praise the increased attention paid by intercultural scholars to intercultural dialogue as a specific focus, using the CID as evidence for this attention.

Participants at the Summer Conference wanted a way to encourage further international connections for intercultural research, and so a proposal was brought before the Council of Communication Associations' Board of Directors at their March 2010 meeting to create the Center for Intercultural Dialogue, which was approved.&lt;ref name="CCA March 2010" /&gt; Wendy Leeds-Hurwitz was appointed Director of CID at that same meeting. The first Advisory Board was approved at the September 2010 meeting, and included: Donal Carbaugh, William Evans, Nazan Haydari, Barbara Hines, Janice Hume, Leena Louhiala-Salminen, Charles Self, Michael Slater, Katerina Sténou and Valerie White.&lt;ref name="CCA September 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Council of Communication Associations Minutes for September 2010|url=https://communicationassociations.wordpress.com/history/minutes/september-2010/}}&lt;/ref&gt; New members of the Board were appointed in 2014. Together Board members represent all of the CCA member associations (through overlapping memberships), as well as the applied context of international non-profits. The CID website now serves as a clearinghouse for information on intercultural dialogue topics, and facilitates connections between international scholars by sharing information on publication opportunities, international conferences and positions, graduate school programs, and researcher profiles.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2015). Intercultural dialogue. In K. Tracy, C. Ilie &amp; T. Sandel (Eds.), ''International encyclopedia of language and social interaction'' (vol. 2, pp. 860-868). Boston: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the CID and the [http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/artsci/communication/wfi.html Waterhouse Family Institute], housed within [[Villanova University]]’s Department of Communication in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/2013/12/17/cid-agreement-with-waterhouse-family-institute/&lt;/ref&gt; The two organizations intend to cooperate on, and seek joint grant funding for, several projects over the next few years. In March 2014, the CID co-sponsored a conference with the University of Macau, entitled "Roundtable on Intercultural Dialogue in Asia."&lt;ref&gt;https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/2014/04/09/roundtable-on-intercultural-dialogue-in-asia-macau/&lt;/ref&gt; A videotape briefly summarizing that event was prepared, and published online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8-wGFSJZHQ&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialogue generally, and intercultural dialogue specifically, have been discussed at multiple conferences, and served as the topic of consideration by many organizations over the past few years, becoming a key term and a "preferred form for human action," and Carbaugh specifically lists this CID as one such effort.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2013"/&gt;  Several other organizations have either the same or a similar name. The CID described in this entry is the only one designed to serve the Communication discipline specifically, and to facilitate the study of intercultural dialogue as a research topic by creating an international network of scholars.&lt;ref name="Witteborn 2012" /&gt;  It is for this reason that the CID's slogan is "Bridging Cultures Through Research."

==Publications==
CID began publishing ''Key Concepts in Intercultural Dialogue'', a set of one page descriptions of technical vocabulary related to intercultural dialogue in various ways, in February 2014.&lt;ref name="centerforinterculturaldialogue.org"&gt;http://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/publications/&lt;/ref&gt; The first few terms were: intercultural dialogue, cosmopolitanism, intercultural competence, coordinated management of meaning, intercultural communication, intercultural capital, and intergroup relations dialogue.&lt;ref name="centerforinterculturaldialogue.org"/&gt; As of November 2014, terms in languages other than English were added, including yuan (Chinese), conscientização (Portuguese), uchi-soto (Japanese), testimonio (Spanish), and interkulturelle Philosophie (German), among others. As of June 2016, concepts were added in translation into a wide range of languages, including Arabic, Belarusian, Chinese, German, Indonesian, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. 

CID began publishing a second series in February 2017, ''Constructing Intercultural Dialogues'' describing specific case studies of times people managed to engage in intercultural dialogues. These are also being translated, with the first one in Italian published in April 2017. &lt;ref name="centerforinterculturaldialogue.org"&gt;http://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/publications/&lt;/ref&gt; A third series, ''CID Posters'', turning verbal concepts into visual images, was introduced in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/publications/cid-posters/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
Since the CID grew out of the NCA Summer Conference on Intercultural Dialogue, all concerned parties agreed to continued use of the logo [[:File:Center for Intercultural Dialogue logo.jpg]] designed for that event by Özer Karakuş of [[Maltepe University]]. The multiple colors bound together represent cultural diversity and the need for intercultural dialogue. The bridge represents the [[Bosphorus Bridge]] in [[Istanbul]], connecting Europe to Asia.

==Social Media==
Due to the efforts of Minh Cao, then Assistant to the Director of the CID, a social media presence was established by 2014, and by 2016 there were thousands of followers in one platform or another.&lt;ref&gt;https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/2014/01/01/cid-and-social-media/&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a YouTube channel,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/IntercultDialogue&lt;/ref&gt; a Facebook group,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Center.for.Intercultural.Dialogue.DC&lt;/ref&gt; a LinkedIn group,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6533775&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/IntercultDialog&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM)''' is a non-profit organization set out to preserve ancient manuscripts of the New Testament. This aim is accomplished by taking high resolution digital photographs of all extant Greek New Testament [[biblical manuscripts|manuscripts]]. The organization was founded by [[Daniel B. Wallace]], a professor at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], in Texas on September 13, 2002, and acts under the umbrella of The Center for the Research of Early Christian Documents (CRECD). Wallace is the executive director of CSNTM. 

Wallace has said the goal of the center is to photograph 1.3 million leaves of Greek New Testament manuscripts, and estimates this goal will not be reached until 2020.&lt;ref name="dallasnews"&gt;Fleck, Deborah"[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-relnewtestament_08met.ART.Central.Edition1.4688c1c.html Fleck, Deborah, "Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts working to preserve ancient pieces,"] The Dallas Morning News, March 8, 2008. Retrieved April 18, 2008. Additional information from other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The CSNTM team has already photographed manuscripts in [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople at the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church]]; the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in Münster, Germany; [[Tübingen University]], Germany; the Monastery of St. John the Theologian on the island of Patmos, Greece; the National Archive in Tirana, Albania; the [[University of Michigan]]; several colleges at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]; [[University of Glasgow]]; [[Gennadius Library]]; [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], The [[Chester Beatty Library]], various locations throughout Greece, and other sites. The Center and Wallace have also examined manuscripts in Vienna, Cologne, Florence, Berlin, at St. Catherine’s Monastery (Sinai), The [[Vatican City|Vatican]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], the University of Dresden, [[Harvard University]], the British Library, [[Princeton University]], and several other sites.

The activity of CSNTM is limited by several factors, including international law, finances, and the traditional thinking of the other institutions regarding the copying of valuable manuscripts. In spite of these difficulties CSNTM has digital images of:
* [[Codex Sinaiticus]]
* [[Codex Alexandrinus]]
* [[Codex Vaticanus]]
* [[Codex Washingtonianus]]
* [[Codex Boernerianus]]
* [[Codex Beratinus]]

Although the primary focus of the CSNTM is [[digital preservation]] of New Testament manuscripts, it also works with printed books related to textual criticism such as von Soden's Greek New Testament ("Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte," Verlag von Arthur Glaue, Berlin 1902-1910). CSNTM holds also one manuscript of New Testament, Gregory-Aland minuscule 2882, a 10th- or 11th-century copy of Luke’s Gospel.

[[File:CODICOLOGY.jpg|thumb|upright|Codicological signs]]
'''Codicology''' (from [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|[[codex]]}}, [[genitive]] {{Lang|la|codicis}}, "notebook, book"; 
and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{Lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of [[codex|codices]] or manuscript books written on parchment (or paper) as physical objects. It is often referred to as 'the archaeology of the book', concerning itself with the materials ([[parchment]], sometimes referred to as membrane or [[vellum]], [[paper]], pigments, inks and so on), and techniques used to make books, including their binding.

There are no clear-cut definitions: some codicologists say that their field encompasses [[palaeography]], the study of handwriting, while some palaeographers say that their field encompasses codicology. The study of written features such as [[marginalia]], [[glosses]], ownership inscriptions, etc. falls in both camps, as does the study of the [[illuminated manuscript|physical aspects of decoration]], which otherwise belongs to [[art history]].

By a close examination of the physical attributes of a book, it is sometimes possible to establish the history and provenance of a book, or to match up long-separated elements originally from the same book.  Palaeographers and codicologists may also study the history of libraries, manuscript-collecting and of book-cataloguing.

A '''critical edition''' of an opera has been defined by American [[musicologist]] [[Philip Gossett]] as "an edition that bases itself wherever possible on the very finest and most accurate sources for an opera. That means that it must study the entire performance history of a work."&lt;ref name=GAZZ/&gt;

Gossett continues:
:In some cases of course we have an autograph manuscript, and that helps us, but it is also where many of the problems start, because composers are known to have made mistakes in their autograph manuscripts. And therefore we are required—we feel it is necessary—to intervene and to correct errors that sometimes have been perpetrated on these works by printed editions from the beginning, so they are just mistakes in the old editions, simple mistakes.&lt;ref name=GAZZ&gt;Luiz Gazzola, [http://operalively.com/forums/content.php/535-Exclusive-Opera-Lively-Interview-with-Italian-Opera-scholar-Dr-Philip-Gossett "Exclusive ''Opera Lively'' Interview with Italian Opera scholar Dr. Philip Gossett"] on operalively.com. 17 June 2012. Retrieved 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of critical editions of many works from the 19th-century Italian operatic repertory did not begin until the 1950s and resulted from the revival of interest from that time forward in the ''[[bel canto]]'' era—early 1800s to approximately 1850 and known as the ''primo ottocento''—written by [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], and [[Giuseppe Verdi]], in addition to many other relatively minor composers who composed many works.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Roger (1998), "The 19th and 20th centuries", in Sadie, Vol. Two, pp. 14—16&lt;/ref&gt; But, as musicologist Ellen Rosand also notes, "the editing of operatic works from the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Rosand 1998, pp. 11—13&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Rosand 1998, pp 13—14&lt;/ref&gt; and 19th century provides many considerable challenges.

In an online essay – "What is a critical edition?: Answers to Questions You Never Thought to Ask" – which focuses primarily on Rossini, musicologist Patricia Brauner of the Center for Italian Opera Studies at the University of Chicago explains several different aspects of a critical edition, including the process of producing published editions and the ultimate value of them for performers and conductors.&lt;ref&gt;Brauner, [http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Essays%20from%20CIAO/Rcritical%20edition.html "What is a critical edition?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Musicologist]]s such as Gossett and [[Roger Parker]] represent parallel approaches to the works of the Italian ''bel canto'' era. The former is now General Editor of ''The Critical Edition of the Works of Giuseppe Verdi''&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html Critical editions of Verdi's operas published by the University of Chicago] on humanities.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Chicago's Center for Italian Opera Studies – in addition to being an acknowledged expert in preparing critical editions of the operas of Rossini – while the other is Professor of Music at [[King's College London]] and editor of many of the operas of Donizetti,&lt;ref&gt;Parker, "The Critical Editions of Gaetano Donizetti's Operas" on ricordi.it&lt;/ref&gt; as well as having written extensively on Verdi. He is the founding co-editor (with Arthur Groos) of the ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', and he continues as General Editor (with Gabriele Dotto, who headed the editorial division of Ricordi until 2001) of ''The Critical Edition of the Operas of Gaetano Donizetti'' published by [[Casa Ricordi]] of Milan.

Gossett clarifies how the existence of these editions may affect performances:
:We don’t believe that everybody has to perform just what we do, because that’s not what they did in the nineteenth century, not what composers did or expected, but we do think that performers should base their work on the finest editions possible, and that’s what we try to produce.&lt;ref name=GAZZ/&gt;

The pioneering work of the major Italian music publishing house, [[Casa Ricordi]], reveals how extensive the company's involvement in restoring the work of 19th-century composers Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi has been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halleonard.com/bin/CatClassicalCriticaleds.pdf Universal Music Publishing Classical Critical Editions] website&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the German publishing house [[Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter-Verlag]] has been producing editions of Rossini's operas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hum.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Barenreiter%20plan.htm "Works of Giacchino Rossini"] on hum.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt; having become the successor to the Fondazione Rossini Pesaro, which produced many editions between 1979 and 2005. Today, many are still published by Ricordi in Europe and in the US by the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hum.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Ravail.html List of critical editions produced under the Fondazione Rossini, 1979 to 2005] on hum.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dittography''' is the accidental, erroneous act of repeating a letter, word, phrase or combination of letters by a scribe or copyist.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Wegner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SIMsY6b2n2gC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A student's guide to textual criticism of the Bible: its history, methods, and results''], InterVarsity Press, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in the field of [[textual criticism]]. The opposite phenomenon, in which a copyist omits text by skipping from a word or phrase to a similar word or phrase further on, is known as [[haplography]].

==Example==
[[Papyrus 98|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;]] in Rev 1:13 has {{lang|el|περιεζωσμμενον}} instead of {{lang|el|περιεζωσμενον}} (doubled μ). [[Codex Vaticanus]]  in John 13:14 word {{lang|el|διδασκαλος}} is repeated twice. In Codex Vaticanus in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], a book of the [[Bible]], verse 19:34, the phrase "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians" appears twice while it only appears once in other manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/dittography.html Dittography—earlham.edu/~seidti]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8049">'''Ecologically sustainable development''' is the environmental component of [[sustainable development]]. It can be achieved partially through the use of the [[precautionary principle]]; if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent [[environmental degradation]].
Also important is the principle of [[intergenerational equity]]; the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations. In order for this movement to flourish, environmental factors should be more heavily weighed in the valuation of assets and services to provide more incentive for the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity.

==Political considerations==
Effective political support is necessary for ecologically sustainable development. The mobilization of governments can be translated into action plans that are crucial to [[Sustainable development#Politics|sustainable development]]. Development efforts can be influenced by patterns of family arrangements, work attitudes, [[Morality|social morality]]—particularly interpersonal responsibilities, hierarchy of authority, quality of scientific education and implementation, and degree of domestic stability—especially, freedom from [[social conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel.

ISSN (Online) 1940-0004, ISSN (Print) 2194-6566, DOI: 10.1515/ngs-2013-021, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; National policy and development planning requires three conditions to permit ecological [[sustainability]]: action-oriented values to which individuals are committed, political authorities that favour long-term ecological benefits over immediate economic gains, and a policy with a politically competent [[constituency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Lynton K.|title=Political Aspects of Ecologically Sustainable Development|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1984|volume=11|issue=04|pages=299–308|doi=10.1017/S037689290001465X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S037689290001465X|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has taken an evidence based approach to sustainability development by using Environmental [[Sustainability measurement|Sustainability Indicators]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=47F48106-1 |title=Environmental Sustainability Indicators |author=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guiding tool for policy development. At the municipal level, many cities also use evidence based indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ca/community/3568.aspx |title=Sustainability Charter|author=City of Surrey|accessdate=7 May 2016}}

==Forums for ecologically sustainable development==
The World Conservation Strategy was published in 1980, becoming one of the most encouraging developments that uses a goal-oriented programme for political change concerning ecological sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert P.|title=How to Save the World: Strategy for World Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwghAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1980|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|isbn=978-0-389-20011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication marked a fundamental policy shift for the global [[conservation movement]]. The traditional focus became cure rather than [[Prevention Science|Prevention]], confirming the growing trend on the assimilation of preservation and development aims that are key to an ecologically sustainable society. Specifically, the concentration on [[wildlife conservation]] drifted into a concern for wider strains degrading the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=John|title=The Origins of the World Conservation Strategy|journal=Environmental Review|year=1986|volume=10|issue=3|pages=177–187|jstor=3984544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It promotes the principles of sustainable development and addresses the environmental concerns introduced by [[economic development]] decisions with a format that targets a wide audience. There are three chief conservation objectives:
#Maintaining essential [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and life-support systems
#Preserving [[genetic diversity]]
#Establishing a sustainable use of [[species]] and [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|title=Ecologically Sustainable Development: Integrating Economics, Ecology, and Law|journal=Willamette Law Review|year=1995|volume=31|issue=2|pages=261–306|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=31+Willamette+L.+Rev.+261&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=118207f62b4908b2ee0eb7a21f829a93|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other efforts such as the World Campaign for the Biosphere present environmental obstacles constantly before governmental and scientific authorities. Nicholas Polunin, former president of the Foundation for Environmental Conservation, believed the starting point for the World Campaign effort occurred in 1966 at an [[UNESCO]] conference in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polunin|first=Nicholas|title=Our Global Environment and the World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1982|volume=9|issue=02|pages=115|doi=10.1017/S0376892900020002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference examined conditions that hinder ecologically sustainable development such as rapid [[population growth]], proliferation of [[nuclear weapon]]s, and depletion of [[natural resource]]s. Similarly, the [[The Global 2000 Report to the President|Global 2000 Report to the President]], presents environmental prospective conditions that are likely to worsen if public policies, institutions, and rates of technologic advancement do not change. Findings of this type prompted [[environmentalist]]s and the Foundation for Environmental Conservation to initiate the World Campaign project and have included the following suggestions:
:*Publication and broadcast of [[environmental issue]]s
:*Use of traditional [[Media (communication)|communication mediums]] such as posters and automobile stickers
:*Distribution of increasing basic and applied environmental research results
:*Information about [[family planning]] and the necessity to control population growth
:*Designating more area as [[national park]]s or [[wilderness area]]s, including the ocean
:*Organization of local, state, national, and international conferences to discuss environmental issues
:*Encouraging sustainable uses of our natural resources
:*Establishment of [[common law]]s for the Earth and mankind
:*Obtaining support form [[nongovernmental organization]]s and [[institution]]s for the World Campaign
:*Attaining recognition such as "Guardians of the Biosphere Awards," for persons and/or groups that demonstrate actions to preserve the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=The World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=The American Biology Teacher|volume=46|issue=5|pages=269–271|doi=10.2307/4447840|jstor=4447840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erotic humiliation''' is [[consent (BDSM)|consensual]] psychological [[humiliation]] performed in order to produce erotic excitement or [[sexual arousal]]. This can be for either the person(s) being humiliated and demeaned or the person(s) humiliating, or both. It is sometimes performed before spectators, including pornography and [[webcam]] viewers. It may be part of [[Bondage (BDSM)|BDSM]] and other [[sexual roleplay]], or accompanied by the sexual stimulation of the genitals (or other erotic region) of one or both parties in the activity.

Humiliation is a subjective issue, and is dependent on context. It does not need to be sexual in nature; as with many other sexual activities, it is the feelings that are obtained from the experience that are desired, regardless of the nature of the actual activity. Usually there is a feeling of [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|submission]] for the person being humiliated, and [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|dominance]], for the person implementing the humiliation. Erotic humiliation can be done verbally and/or physically, and can take place privately or publicly. Some individuals assume an acting role and others prefer to be spoken to in a degrading way. A classic technique that can be used to put the submissive into a [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] mind space is to humiliate them while also providing them with sexual stimulation. Select individuals who desire this form of humiliation also use it to acquire emotional release. Humiliation can become [[ritual]]ized, and unlike some sexual variations, it can also be easily carried out over a long distance (such as [[online]]).

While fantasy and fascination with erotic humiliation is a prevalent part of BDSM and other sexual roleplay, relatively little has been written on it.&lt;ref name="Wild Side Sex"&gt;{{cite book|author=Midori (美登里) |title=''Wild Side Sex: The Book of Kink. Educational, Sensual, And Entertaining Essays''|year=2005|publisher=Daedalus Publishing|isbn=978-1-881943-22-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO0BbX_oBiUC&amp;dq=erotic+humiliation|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humiliation play can, however, be taken to a point where it becomes emotionally or psychologically distressing to one or the other partner, especially if it is [[public humiliation]]. Erotic humiliation can become extreme enough to be considered a form of [[edgeplay]], which some consider may best be approached with advance [[Negotiation (BDSM)|negotiation]] and use of a [[safeword]].

==Terminology and overview==
The most common name for the individual being humiliated is the ''[[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]]'', and the opposite individual who humiliates the bottom is often called the ''[[Top (BDSM)|top]]''. However, these terms are standard ones that are used in general [[Domination &amp; submission (BDSM)|dominant/submissive]] roleplay and are not specific to humiliation interests.

* If the top is regarded as a female, they are sometimes called the ''humiliatrix''. Other common names include [[Master (BDSM)|''Master''/''Dom'']] (male top), and ''Mistress''/[[Sexual domination|''Domme'']] (female top). 
* For the bottom (irrespective of gender), other common names are  ''[[Slave (BDSM)|slave]]'' and [[Sexual submission|''sub''/''submissive'']].

While elements of erotic humiliation may be part of a number of [[domination and submission]]-based activities, humiliation is not the same as [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|submission]]. The recipient does not necessarily seek to be ordered about. Humiliation comes into its own as a sexual force when the recipient seeks the humiliation over and above means. For example, being spanked is primarily valued because of the belittlement involved. Humiliation therefore encompasses a range of [[paraphilia]], including [[foot fetish]], [[breast fetish]], [[shoe fetish]], [[body worship]], [[spanking]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], and most [[BDSM]] styles. It can be as basic as the desire to kiss and massage feet as a precursor to sex; and it can be complex, involving roleplay and public displays of subservience. It can also be for a set period of time (a "[[Scene (BDSM)|scene]]") or an ongoing facet of a relationship. The ''humiliation'' is not intrinsic to the act or the object. Rather, it is [[semiotics|semiotically]] charged by the shared attitude of the partners engaged in the act. They invest specific acts, objects, or body parts with a humiliating aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giannini | first1 = AJ | last2 = Colapietro | first2 = G | last3 = Slaby | first3 = AE | last4 = Melemis | first4 = SM | last5 = Bowman | first5 = RK | title = Sexualization of the female foot as a response to sexually transmitted epidemics: a preliminary study | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 491–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9819924 | doi=10.2466/pr0.83.6.491-498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scenarios may give rise to sexual humiliation. Some scenarios may be based on [[verbal abuse]] and others on physical aspects.

===Verbal humiliation===
* [[Animal roleplay|Animal play]], referring to the recipient as a pet (dog, bitch...); making the humiliated one eat and drink from pet food and water bowls.&lt;ref name="Different loving1"&gt;Different loving, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verbal belittlement, with such words as  ''boy'', ''girl'', ''missy'', and ''pet''.
* [[Insults]] and [[verbal abuse]], such as ''fat'', ''ugly'', ''stupid'', ''sick'', ''disgusting'', and ''worthless''.
* Degrading names, such as ''slut'', ''shit'', ''bitch'', ''cunt'', and ''whore''.
* Disparaging or cruel references about breasts, facial appearance, genitalia (including small penis size, [[Erectile dysfunction|erection difficulties]], or [[circumcision]] status), buttocks, or about behaviors such as walking, responsiveness, and hygiene.
* Requirement to ask permission for everyday activities, such as going to the toilet, spending money, and eating.
* In [[Feederism]] the dominant partner may humiliate the other by pointing out their weight or calling them names like ''piggy'' or ''fatty''. They also might make fun of the other and their self-control, or poke and grope their flesh.
* Forced repetition, such as the humiliated one being obliged to repeat commands that he or she has been given and to confirm them.
* Forced [[flattery]], such as agreeing that every decision that the dominant makes is wise, correct, and justifiable, while additionally praising the dominant's physical and personality traits.
* [[Derision|Mockery]], [[derision]], and [[Ridiculous|ridicule]].
* Scolding of the type commonly reserved for children.&lt;ref name="Different loving2"&gt;Different loving, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical humiliation===
*[[Facial (sexuality)|Ejaculating]], spitting, and urinating on the submissive's body, especially the face.
* "Forced" anal penetration, with dildos, [[Butt plug|anal plugs]], and similar objects.
* [[Servitude (BDSM)|Servitude]]
* "Forced" sexual degradation, including such acts as [[cunnilingus]], [[analingus]], and [[fellatio]].
* Detailed accountability and control ([[micro-management]]) as to time spent and activities done, including lists of jobs to do, precise directions as to how the job is to be performed, and exactly how to act and behave.
* Real Humiliation is the act of making a person carry out specific tasks which involve other real people who are not aware that there is a task or dominant relation issuing the task in the background.
* Specific rituals and affectations to be adopted. This includes displays of subservience, such as lighting cigarettes, walking a pace behind the dominant, speaking only when spoken to, eye contact rules, kneeling or [[Prostration|prostrating]] oneself in front of the dominant when expecting orders, eating only after others or on the floor, and low-status place to sleep.
** [[Body worship]], including such activities as kissing or licking the dominant's feet, boots, [[buttocks]], [[anus]], [[vulva]], etc. to express acknowledgment, subservience, [[shame]], and even positive emotions (such as happiness and excitement).
* Deprivation of privacy, which may include the submissive's never being able to leave the room in which the dominant is present without permission.
** The dominant watches while the submissive uses the toilet.
** The submissive's being forbidden to leave the house or 'dungeon' in general for the duration of slavery or servitude, etc.
* [[Discipline (BDSM)]], including [[erotic spanking]], slapping, whipping, restraint, and other BDSM activities (such as [[cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|cock-and-ball torture]] (CBT)).
* [[Dresscode (BDSM)]]: prescriptions and proscriptions of clothing, even in public.
** For women, a common example is being mandated to wear only [[bikinis]] or lingerie.
** For men, forced [[Feminization (activity)|feminizing]] and [[cross-dressing]].
** Both men and women may be expected to go completely [[Nudity|naked]], with decorative objects such as collars, diapers, bands, tiaras, and cuffs as the only exceptions.
* [[Erotic sexual denial]], including the use of a [[Chastity belt (BDSM)|chastity device]].
* Wearing of external signs of "ownership", such as collars.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Different loving" /&gt; now ambiguous, add 1, 2 or 3 to name or 4 for new page number? --&gt;
* [[Public humiliation]], in which the submissive's friends or family, or strangers, are aware of or even witness the treatment.
* [[Erotic objectification]], in which the submissive is used as [[human furniture]], such as a footstool.
* [[Embarrassment]].
* [[Cuckold#Cuckoldry as a fetish|Cuckolding]], a mostly heterosexual fetish in which the dominant woman has sex with a man outside of the relationship while the submissive man may or may not be present.&lt;ref name="Ley"&gt;{{cite book|pages=173, 222|title=Insatiable Wives: Women Who Stray and the Men Who Love Them|author=David J. Ley|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781442200319}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the man is not present, he might help her choose what clothes to wear when she meets the other man, or they might get together afterward so she can tell him about it, either while having sex or in addition to withholding sex.  If the man is present during the cuckolding, he may or may not be allowed to pleasure himself while watching.  The cuckolding may or may not be followed by sex between the couple. In recent years, the gender reversed form of cuckoldry (where the man has sex with a woman outside the relationship) has become more commonly referred to as "cuckqueenery" or "cuckqueening" (sometimes also spelled "cuckquean").&lt;ref name="Ley"/&gt; Another variant of the cuckolding fetish is that a heterosexual couple fantasizes that another man has already impregnated the woman.&lt;ref name="Cuckolding"&gt;{{cite book

* The submissive's having to ask permission to [[orgasm]] during [[sex]] or [[masturbation]].
* The submissive's being forced to wear a gag or restraints on the body.
* Forced [[masturbation]] in a humiliating manner.&lt;ref name="Wild Side Sex2"&gt;Wild Side Sex, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Enema]]s cause feelings of humiliation which are key to many of those engaged in [[klismaphilia]],&lt;ref name="Different loving3"&gt;Different loving, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; and watching the consequent defecation can amplify that humiliation.
* [[Candaulism]].

Some sexual humiliation involves physical inflicting pain, but much of it is far more concerned with ridicule, mocking, [[Defamation|degradation]], and [[embarrassment]].

[[Sexual roleplaying]] can involve humiliation. For example, one person might [[Animal roleplay|play the part of a dog]] because they enjoy being mock-forced into it, and the top might emphasize the lowness of the bottom's status as an animal, whereas another person might play the role of the dog without any element of humiliation, simply as an expression of an inner animal or playful spirit.

==Psychology of humiliation==
[[File:Piss drinking.png|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Dominance over a slave may involve not just dominating physically but also mentally, such as through erotic humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michelle|last=Fegatofi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrsGBgAAQBAJ|title=UNVEILED The Secret Submissive Within|publisher=Lulu|year=2013|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the practice of [[golden showers]]. Image shows a female urinating into the mouth of a male.]]

Humiliation in general stimulates the same brain regions that are associated with physical pain, the inference being that humans evolved to remember social rewards and punishments as strongly as they recall physical reward or pain in response to their environment. As with any form of pain experimentation in a sexual context, [[Consent (BDSM)|consent]] and (paradoxically) a high degree of awareness and communication are needed to ensure that the result is desirable, rather than abusive. For example, a submissive may enjoy being insulted in some ways but would be genuinely crushed and devastated if humiliated or insulted in other ways.

Humiliation play is also connected to [[sexual fetish]]ism, in that non-sexual activities may become sexualised by association with arousal, and also may be associated with [[exhibitionism]] in the sense of wanting others to witness (or being aroused by others witnessing) one's sexual degradation.

For some people, activities such as name-calling are a way of achieving [[ego reduction]] or getting over [[sexual inhibition]]s. For example, between gay people, terms usually associated with [[homophobia]] may be used, such as ''[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]'' and ''[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]''.

As with all sexual activities, some people have [[Sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]] about humiliation, and others actually undertake it as a lifestyle or in a [[Scene (BDSM)|scene]]. Sexual fantasies relating to mild humiliation are common. Some humiliation [[roleplay]] ([[Animal roleplay|pup-play]] and [[age play]] in particular) is combined with loyalty and care-giving to the extent that these fetishes can be seen as exercises in trust rather than primarily a humiliation fetish. The desire to be beneath the other partner during intercourse, the idea of "getting caught" (as in having sex in the garden or woods), and simulated rape are emotional games that emphasise status, vulnerability, and control. However, for most people such ideas remain fantasies; the people would have strong reservations about the fantasies' being made public, or engaged in with a partner in real life, however erotic the idea may be.  When someone reveals a fetish to a partner, this usually is a result of great trust. However, the desire to be humiliated may be a motivating cause for confession, in that the act of confessing can itself be humiliating. Many people worry about being ridiculed for their fetishes, and such ridicule from their partners could be psychologically catastrophic. Therefore, many people use online humiliation (in which the [[humiliator]] and others are involved via the [[Internet]], using chat, email, websites, etc.) as a compromise between exhibitionism and reality on the one hand, and safety and anonymity on the other.

==Online humiliation==
Online humiliation is the desire to be seen in a sexually embarrassing context on the Internet. This practice allows the submissive to seek fetish partners from across the world. As the Internet has grown and continues to grow, so does online humiliation. Anecdotal reports indicate that the proportion of men being dominated by women on the Internet, through some type of personal service provided for a fee by the woman, vastly exceeds the instances of a woman being dominated online by a man, or another woman.

Common methods of online humiliation:

* Public [[pillory]].
* Embarrassing photographic or video assignments for submissives, who must publicly post pictures or videos of their humiliation. The dominant may require public acts or exposure. Sometimes humiliating words are written on the submissive's body before photographing.
* Requiring the submissive to post publicly their name, address, phone number, employer, or other personal information.
* The requirement for submissives to keep online journals detailing personal information, such as masturbation frequency, thoughts or fantasies, technique or aid(s) used, and disposal of semen (if the submissive is allowed to masturbate).
* The requirement for the submissive to place themself in [[chastity]], and to publicly post a picture showing their status.
* Verbal abuse.
* Publicly bidding for items that reveal their fetishes.
* Money slavery, in which the submissive must buy the dominant gifts and pay the dominant's bills and taxes, or give the dominant direct access to their bank accounts and credit cards.
* Homework slavery, in which the submissive must do the dominant's homework or occupational work.
* Repetitive assignments, such as copying the phone book.
* Humiliating the submissive by changing information on social sites.
* Controlling the submissive's computer remotely, through [[remote desktop software]] the submissive is required to install.

These practices can be conducted through chat, [[webcam]], e-mail, BDSM contact websites, and proprietary virtual spaces such as ''[[Second Life]]'' or [[FetLife]].

== History ==
In 1973, feminist scholar [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] wrote an influential essay, ''The Rhetoric of Women’s Liberation: An Oxymoron'', that drew feminists' attention to women's role as communicators within rhetorical frameworks, and to the relevance of feminist theory to the study of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer | first=Michaela D. E. | title=Women Speak(ing): Forty Years of Feminist Contributions to Rhetoric and an Agenda for Feminist Rhetorical Studies | journal=Communication Quarterly | volume=55 | issue=1 | date=2007-02-27 | issn=0146-3373 | doi=10.1080/01463370600998293 | pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholar [[Patricia Bizzell]] noted in 1992 that classical canon of rhetoric consists almost entirely of well-educated male authors.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bizzell|first1=Patricia|date=1992|title=Opportunities for Feminist Research in the History of Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, feminist rhetoric scholars argued that the world of rhetoric was suffused with patriarchal values. To address this perceived problem, they made efforts to include women authors in the history of rhetoric; pointed out connections between feminist issues and theories of rhetoric; and wrote rhetorical criticism from feminist perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-feminist-rhetoric-1690791|title=Feminist Rhetoric|last1=Nordquist|first1=Richard|website=Thought Co.|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These academics were initially inspired by feminist scholarship outside of rhetoric and composition studies, but eventually developed a distinctive school within this tradition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Following the initial feminist rhetoric movement, the Coalition of Women (later Feminist) Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition was formed in 1988.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to its mission statement, this coalition “fosters inquiry in the histories, theories, and pedagogues of rhetoric and composition” for the "advancement of feminist research".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwshrc.org/about-us/our-mission/|title=Our Mission|website=Coalition of Feminist Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of teachers and scholars dedicated to promoting the [[intersectionality]] of communication and collaboration within feminist rhetoric and research methods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Founding members included Winifred Horner, Jan Swearingen, Nan Johnson, Marjone Curry Woods, and Kathleen Welch.&lt;ref name="Ratcliffe"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ratcliffe |first= Krista |chapter=The Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries |title=Present State of Scholarship in the History of Rhetoric: A Twenty-First Century Guide|editor1=Lynée Lewis Gaillet |editor2=Winifred Bryan Horner |publisher=University of Missouri Press|date=2010 |pages=185–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues with [[Andrea Lunsford]], Jackie Royster, [[Cheryl Glenn (academic)|Cheryl Glenn]], Shirley Logan, and other contemporary feminist writing scholars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 1996 brought the publication of ''Peitho'', the coalition’s newspaper, published by [[Susan Jarratt]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In present day feminist rhetoric, a point of emphasis is changing research methods and methodologies to include the discourse of marginalized groups.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Feminist rhetoric works to expand the rhetorical canon. The rhetorical canon is traditionally composed of five parts: Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Canons/Canons.htm|title=the canons of rhetoric|website=rhetoric.byu.edu|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced by the Roman orator [[Cicero]] in his treatise ''De Inventione'' around 50 BC. The idea was expanded by the Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian]] 150 years later in ''Institutio Oratoria.'' The rhetorical canon has been used in rhetorical education since its creation. Rhetorical treatises have based their purpose off these canons. Rhetoric is integrated in the education system, which means that students are taught the rhetorical canon as well. Feminist rhetoric scholars argue that this canon, and its methods of persuasion or argument, exclude some valuable forms of public discourse and narrative, and seek to expand it accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Methodology in rhetoric studies ===
Scholars, such as Jessica Enoch and Jaqueline Jones Royster, introduced the idea of changing the way research is recognized and constructed. Scholars in rhetoric studies agree there is a plethora of voices and demographics to draw upon for data necessary for research in the field.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enoch|first=Jessica|date=2004|title="Para La Mujer": Defining a Chicana Feminist Rhetoric at the Turn of the Century|url=|journal=College English|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest this is achieved by asking questions that have never been asked before, recognizing the wealth of materials (or lack thereof) in archives, and expanding the idea of an archive.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In recent years, archives have been deconstructed, or critically analyzed, outside of scholarly articles. Feminist rhetorical academics work to develop research methods and methodologies by including new types of archival research such as- yearbooks, small town newspapers, and community contributing archival websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lueck|first=Amy|date=2017|title=Classbook Sense': Genre and Girls' School Yearbooks in the Early-Twenties- Century American High School|url=|journal=College English|volume=79.4|pages=358–383|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global narratives ===
Another main idea in feminist rhetoric is making the point of view, and the rhetorical canon, more expansive than what lies within the United States' domain of discourse.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: New Horizons for  Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy Studies|last1=Royster|first1=Jacqueline Jones|last2=Kirsch|first2=Gesa E.|date=2012|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric scholars ask the questions of how rhetoric, writing studies, and social change intersect, or may be influenced by politics, the economy, religions, cultures, and education.&lt;ref name="Kirsh"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirsch|first=Gesa E.|last2=Royster|first2=Jacqueline J.|date=2010|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: In Search of Excellence|jstor=27917867|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=61|issue=4|pages=640–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key term used in this field is "[[transnationality]]", defined as the culture of one nation moving through borders to another nation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is used with the terms cultural hybridity and intertextuality, which continue the theory of cultures, texts, and ideas mixing with one another.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gender ===
Feminist rhetoric works to represent the voices and discourse of genders that go beyond the binary of male and female. [[Transgender]] discourse is another main point of focus in feminist rhetoric, which is recognized by scholars as a lack of privilege some authors have.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rawson|first1=K.J.|last2=Ronald|first2=Kate|date=2010|title=Queering Feminist Rhetorical Canonization|journal=Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies|pages=39–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royster and others have called for research focused on how gender dynamics affect communication, including rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity ===
[[Race and ethnicity]] is an area of focus for several scholars in feminist rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have changed research methods to include international races and ethnicity outside the typical rhetoric canon.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric focuses on how archiving cultural rhetoric, such as that of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women, can create a better understanding of the pedagogy of research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webber|first=Jim|date=2008-10-14|title=A Review of: "Refiguring Rhetorical Education: Women Teaching African American, Native American, and Chicano/a Students, 1865–1911, by Jessica Enoch."|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=38|issue=4|pages=467–469|doi=10.1080/02773940802405546|issn=0277-3945}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue that has arisen in feminist rhetoric is the discourse of colored women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some female scholars of color have written about their perceived need to mask their identity when sharing their voices and opinions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Sano-Franchini, Jennifer, Donnie Sackey and Stacey Pigg. “Methodological Dwellings: A Search for Feminisms in Rhetoric &amp; Composition.” Present Tense, Vol. 1, Issue 2. Michigan State Univ. Press. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric theory works to legitimize the ethnic discourse of women and give it a platform in the academia of rhetoric and writing studies.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Challenges ==
Feminist rhetoric scholars have noted the difficulty in including diverse voices in the rhetorical canon.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Scholars have argued that changes in research methods may be needed to better include the voices of those who are disabled, trans, and [[queer]] in rhetoric studies.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dolmage, Jay, et al. “Refiguring Rhetorica: Linking Feminist Rhetoric and Disability Studies.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 23–38. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite longstanding feminist opposition to processes of canonization as inherently imposing limits and excluding perspectives, feminist rhetoric has begun to develop its own canon of commonly referenced texts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accordingly, feminist rhetoric scholars try to include the works of unknown feminist rhetors in their theorization processes, and develop a gendered analysis or approach that actively includes rhetors who are traditionally excluded from rhetorical canons, such as women of color or low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Rhetors, along with expanding the feminist rhetorical canon, work to make feminist rhetoric applicable in pedagogy and education. Scholars discuss the importance of research, whether that be changing research methods or looking further into textual research.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some suggest this can be done by theorizing, others want to employ critical imagination.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Addison, Joanne, and Kate Ronald. “Researching Literacy as a Lived Experience.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 136–151. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Theory as a research method approaches discourse from different communities as a generalized idea that allows people to participate in the world through rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric sees theory in this sense as a form for people to speak out and be included in the rhetorical canon. Critical imagination is using the silence, or lack of work from feminist rhetors, to extrapolate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Scholars discuss how this involves understanding that there is more to not only feminist rhetoric, but feminist practice in theory, than what is written down in textbooks or history. Scholars, such as Royster and Kirsch, acknowledge that feminist rhetoric needs to draw from the silence to help set a new precedent for rhetorical practices in the future.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A part of critical imagination is knowing that the documentation of rhetoric thus far isn’t the only important rhetoric that should contribute to pedagogy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Eves, Rosalyn. “Landmark Essays on Rhetoric and Feminism, 1973–2000 ed. by Cheryl Glenn and Andrea Lunsford (Review)” ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'', Volume 19, Number 4. pp. 705-708. Michigan State Univ. Press. Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
A goal of feminist rhetoric is to be viewed as a rhetorical theory of writing as opposed to a social theory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Micciche, Laura R., and Kate Ronald. “Writing as Feminist Rhetorical Theory.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 173–188. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric seeks to influence the pedagogy of writing in high school and other levels of academia.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Scholars in the field of feminist rhetoric seek to open academic discourse and pedagogy of rhetoric to all types of people.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

[[File:Galerie Colbert.jpg|thumb|The INHA is located in the Colbert Gallery]]
The '''Institut national d'histoire de l'art''' (INHA; National Institute for Art History) is a French research institute, created and governed by Decree No. 2001-621 (July 12, 2001) and situated in [[Paris]].

The Institute develops scientific activity and contributes to international cooperation in most fields of [[art history]] and heritage by exercising research, training and knowledge-diffusion. It is located in the Galerie Colbert in Paris, which houses the Department of Education and Research and the Richelieu Quadrilateral Area. The latter's Labrouste Room houses the Department of Documentation, which holds collections from the Art and Archeology Library founded by [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] in 1897 and donated in 1917 to the [[University of Paris]].

The INHA's mission is to promote international art historical research in all fields of the history of art. It pilots a large number of programs by gathering together university researchers and curators. It organises study days, symposiums, conferences and meeting-debates and develops different resources, documentary bases and research programs in art history. Each year, the INHA invites about sixty art historians, among them experienced researchers, academics, curators, art critics and doctoral students. Twice a year, the INHA publishes a scientific review on art history entitled ''Perspective''. Many documentary bases are to be found on the INHA's website.

The institute is located in Paris at 2, Rue Vivienne, in a former 17th century town house converted into a gallery in the 19th century. Its art history library, one of the largest in the world with more than {{formatnum:1700000}} documents, is located in the Labrouste room of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] at 58 rue de Richelieu.

The INHA provides access to external and internal online databases like [https://www.inha.fr/fr/ressources/outils-documentaires/acces-global-et-organise-aux-ressources-en-histoire-de-l-art-agorha.html AGORHA (''Accès global et organisé aux ressources en histoire de l’art'')] which allows several search modes in the different research fields of the INHA: [https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/jsp/portal/index.jsp general search] (or use « ''Rechercher'' » in the bar), [https://www.inha.fr/_contents/ametys-internal%253Asites/inha/ametys-internal%253Acontents/montee-de-version-d-agorha-apercu-des-nouveautes-article/_metadata/content/_data/rBtOsQxW1GywhbJvoKIEvJX4xm3Abz_aOUdCDp3zTWGgSS41vm-XB6J2M1rCTzU33ZVZFIuNerUFNetDEetmaftLiJg7ZKS1Zb0ec2bdC99b9g3gFWlorw-em_EHOCzivIj3CF97 simple search], expert search and search by links, in particular in the RETIF ([https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/0014 ''répertoire des tableaux italiens dans les collections publiques françaises (XIIIe-XIXe siècles))''] which gives the {{formatnum:13761}} italian paintings held in French public collections.

'''Integrated modification methodology''' ('''IMM''') is a procedure encompassing an open set of scientific techniques for morphologically analyzing the [[built environment]] in a multiscale manner and evaluating its performance in actual states or under specific design scenarios.

The methodology is structured around a nonlinear phasing process aiming for delivering a systemic understanding of any given urban settlement, formulating the modification set-ups for improving its performance, and examining the modification strategies to transform that system. The basic assumption in IMM is the recognition of the built environment as a [[Complex adaptive system|Complex Adaptive System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=J|date=2007|title=Complex Adaptive Systems|url=|journal=CIS Technical Report|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMM has been developed by IMMdesignlab, a research lab based at [[Polytechnic University of Milan|Politecnico di Milano]] at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC).

==History==

IMM began in 2010 as an academic research at Politecnico di Milano. That research criticized the analytical approach frequently used to study and evaluate the built environment by most of the sustainable development methods. By Recognizing the built environment as a [[Complex Adaptive System]] (CAS), IMM is urged towards a holistic simulation rather than simplifying the complex mechanisms within the cities with [[reductionism]].

In 2013, Massimo Tadi established the ''IMMdesignlab'' at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC) of the Politecnico di Milano. The purpose of the mentioned laboratory is to develop IMM through research and education.

IN 2015, ''Integrated Modification Methodology for the Sustainable Built Environment'' has been approved as an academic course in the curriculum of the ''Architectural Engineering'', an International Master Program in Politecnico di Milano.

==Background==

At its theoretical background, Integrated Modification Methodology refers to the contemporary urban development as a highly paradoxical context arisen from the social and economic significance of the cities on the one hand and their arguably negative environmental impacts on the other. Asserting the inevitably of [[urbanization]], IMM declares that the only way to overcome that paradox for the cities is to develop in a profound integration with the [[ecology]]. According to IMM, the fundamental prerequisite of ecologically [[sustainable development]] is to have a comprehensive systemic understanding of the built environment.

IMM suggests that the advancement in construction techniques, building materials quality and transportation technologies alone have not solved the complex problems of the urban life simply because such improvements are not necessarily dealing with the systemic integration. The core argument of IMM is that the performance of the city is being chiefly driven by the complex relationships subsystems rather than the independent qualities of the urban elements. Thus, it aims at portraying the systemic structure of the built environment by introducing a logical framework for modeling the linkage between the city’s static and dynamic elements.

== Methodology ==

Integrated Modification Methodology is based on an iterative process involving the following four major phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first2=S|date=2014|title=Transformation of an urban complex system into a more sustainable form via integrated modification methodology (I.M.M)|url=|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Investigation
# Formulation
# Modification
# Retrofitting and Optimization 
The first phase, Investigation, is a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. It begins with ''Horizontal Investigation'' in which the area under study is being dismantled into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. It follows with ''Vertical Investigation'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first=S|last2=Tadi|first2=Massimo|date=2011|title=, Sustainable urban morphology emergence via Complex Adaptive System analysis|url=|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=|pages=89–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is a study of integral relationships between the mentioned elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named ''[[Key Categories]]''. In a nutshell they are types of [[emergence]] that show how elements come to self-organize or to synchronize their states into forming a new level of organization. Hence in IMM, Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy able to add value to the combined organization. Key categories are the products of the synergy between elementary parts, a new organization that emerge not (simply as) an additive result of the proprieties of the elementary parts. 
IMM declares that the city’s functioning manner is chiefly driven from the Key Categories, hence, they have the most fundamental role in understanding the architecture of the city as a Complex Adaptive System. The Investigation phase concludes with the ''Evaluation'' step which is basically an examination of the system’s performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. The same indicators are later used in the CAS retrofitting process necessary for the final evaluation of the system performance, after the transformation design process occurred.

The Formulation phase is a technical assumption of the most critical Key Category and the urban element within the  area deduced from the Investigation phase. These critical attributes are being interpreted as the Catalysts of transformation and are to come to the designer’s use to set a contextual priority list of ''[[Design Ordering Principals]]''.

The third phase is the introduction of the modification/design scenarios to the project and advances with examining them by the exact procedure of the Investigation phase in a repetitive manner until the transformed context is predicted to be acceptable in arrangement and evaluation.

The fourth phase, Retrofitting and Optimization, is a testing process of the outcomes of the modification phase, then a local optimization by technical strategies (e.g. installing photovoltaic panels, designing green roofs, studying building orientations etc.) is initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Mohammad Zadeh|first2=Hadi|date=2014|others=Naraghi, Vahabzadeh Manesh|title=Environmental and energy performance optimization of a neighborhood in Tehran, via IMM methodology|url=|journal=International Journal of Engineering Science and Innovative Technology (IJESIT)|volume=|pages=409–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IAML was founded after [[World War II]] to "promote international cooperation and standardization in such matters as [[cataloging]], standards of service, personnel training and the exchange of materials between [[libraries]]."&lt;ref name=Lonn&gt;Anders Lönn, "International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres," The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, 2002, vol. 12, p. 491. {{ISBN|0-333-60800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of IAML was a three-year process from 1949 to 1951. It was part of the [[United Nations]]' mission to promote world peace. The founding conferences were held in [[Basel]] and [[Florence]] in 1949, in [[Lüneburg]] in 1950, and in [[Paris]] in 1951, the last one conducted by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music Librarianship in the United Kingdom |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Turbet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoCfMEscyzwC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=International+Association+of+Music+Libraries,+Archives+and+Documentation+Centres&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCdRUtG6EYjNswa384GYBw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Association%20of%20Music%20Libraries%2C%20Archives%20and%20Documentation%20Centres&amp;f=false |date=2003 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=9780754605720}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Accademia Nazionale [[Luigi Cherubini]] celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949, an event that brought around 60 music librarians, musicologists, and museum professionals from twelve countries to [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; This was the first meeting of music librarians from around the world; plans for a separate organization had been discussed since the founding of the [[International Musicological Society]] in 1927, but the [[Second World War]] prevented anything from taking shape.&lt;ref name="Pleßke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pleßke|first=Hans-Martin|title=Geschichte und Funktion der Internationalen Vereinigung der Musikbibliotheken (IVMB)|journal=Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen|date=1972|volume=86|issue=6|pages=352–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had caused heavy losses at many [[libraries]], and international cooperation was of utmost importance. 

The goals of the Florence conference included updating the status and locations of the musical sources described in {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Eitner's|de}} ''Biographisch-Bibliographisches Quellen-Lexikon der Musiker und Musikgelehrten der christlichen Zeitrechnung bis zur Mitte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts'' ([[Leipzig]], 1900–1904), establishing a central office in each country responsible for [[Microform|microfilming]] musical sources from before 1800, and addressing issues related to [[Music librarianship#Cataloging and Classification|music cataloging]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; The first goal was realized in 1952 with the founding of the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]].

In 1952, IAML had 224 members in 20 countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Membership grew to about 1,100 members in 39 countries in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The International Association of Music Libraries |journal=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] |first=Thor E. |last=Wood |pages=697–699 |volume=25 |issue=4 |date= June 1959 |jstor=896620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,850 members in 40 countries in 1991,&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt; with national branches in 26 countries as of 2017.

IAML has professional sections, subject sections, study group, and project groups that focus on particular aspects of music librarianship and documentation. Two professional organizations, [[the International Association of Music Information Centres]] and the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]] began as IAML groups but later formed their own organizations.&lt;ref name=Lonn /&gt;

==Structure==
The IAML board of directors is made up of the [[president]], past president, [[Secretary (club)|secretary general]], [[treasurer]], and [[vice presidents]].&lt;ref name=Meinhold&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Alexandra|title=World Guide to Library, Archive, and Information Science Associations|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110226379|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board governs IAML together with a Council (which includes representatives from national branches and professional sections) and the General Assembly.

IAML is affiliated with the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), the [[International Music Council]], and the IMS.&lt;ref name=Meinhold /&gt;

==Activities==
IAML holds annual conferences and has implemented four main programmes, together known as the "R projects" of [[musicology]]: ''Répertoire international des sources musicales'' (RISM), ''[[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale|Répertoire international de littérature musicale]]'' (RILM), ''Répertoire international d'iconographie musicale'' (RIdIM) and ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' (RIPM). IAML publishes a journal, ''Fontes Artis Musicae'', with articles on music librarianship and bibliography as well as reports on IAML conferences and on the progress of the "R projects".&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt;

===Annual Conferences===
IAML holds annual meetings in different locations around the world. Occasionally, meetings are held jointly with other professional organizations. After the founding meetings held from 1949-1951, annual meetings commenced in 1954.&lt;ref name=Geering&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geering|first=Mireille|title=Geschichte und Gegenwart der AIBM|journal=Forum Musikbibliothek|date=1991|volume=3|pages=197–212.

'''Johann Jakob Wettstein''' (also '''Wetstein'''; 5 March 1693 – 23 March 1754) was a Protestant Swiss theologian, best known as a [[New Testament]] critic.

==Biography==

===Youth and study===
Johann Jakob Wettstein was born in [[Basel]]. Among his tutors in theology was [[Samuel Werenfels]] (1657–1740), an influential anticipator of modern critical [[exegesis]]. While still a student, Wettstein began to direct his attention to the special pursuit of his life, the text of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[New Testament]]. A relative, Johann Wettstein, who was the university librarian, gave him permission to examine and collate the principal [[manuscript]]s of the New Testament in the library, and he copied the various readings which they contained into his copy of [[Gerard of Maastricht]]'s edition of the [[Greek language|Greek]] text.

In 1713 in his public examination he defended a dissertation entitled ''De variis Novi Testamenti lectionibus'', and sought to show that variety of readings did not detract from the authority of the Bible. Wettstein paid great attention also to [[Aramaic]] and [[Talmud]]ic Hebrew. In the spring of 1714 he undertook an academic tour, which led him to Paris and England, the great object of his inquiry everywhere being to examine manuscripts of the New Testament. In 1716 he made the acquaintance of [[Richard Bentley]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]; Bentley took great interest in his work and persuaded him to return to Paris to collate carefully the ''Codex Ephraemi'', Bentley having then in view a critical edition of the New Testament.

===Basel===
In July 1717 Wettstein returned to take the office of a minister at large (''diaconus communis'') at Basel, a post which he held for three years, after which he became his father's colleague and successor in the parish of St Leonard's. At the same time he pursued his favourite study, and gave private lectures on New Testament [[exegesis]]. It was then that he decided to prepare a [[textual criticism|critical edition]] of the [[Textus Receptus]] (Greek New Testament}. He had in the meantime broken with Bentley, whose famous ''Proposals'' appeared in 1720. His earlier teachers, however, [[J. C. Iselin]] and [[J. L. Frey]], who were engaged upon work similar to his own, became so unfriendly towards him that after a time he was forbidden any further use of the manuscripts in the library.

A rumour began to be circulated that Wettstein's projected text would take the [[Socinian]] side in the case of such passages as [[First Epistle to Timothy|i Timothy]] iii. 16;&lt;ref&gt;See [[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in other ways (e.g. by regarding Jesus's temptation as a subjective experience, and by explaining some of the miracles in a naturalistic way) he began to be suspected of [[heresy]]. At length in 1729 the charge of projecting an edition of the Greek Testament savouring of [[Arianism|Arian]] and Socinian views was formally laid against him. The end of the long and unedifying trial was his dismissal, on 13 May 1730, from his office of minister of St Leonard's.

===Amsterdam===
He then moved from Basel to [[Amsterdam]], where another relative, [[Johann Heinrich Wettstein]] (1649–1726), had an important printing and publishing business. Here excellent editions of the classics were being published, as well as Gerard of Maastricht's edition of the Greek Testament. Wettstein had begun to print an edition of the Greek Testament, but this was suddenly stopped for some unknown reason. As soon as he reached Amsterdam, in 1730, he published anonymously the ''Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci editionem'', which he had proposed should accompany his Greek Testament, and which was later republished by him, with additions, in 1751. The next year (1731) the [[Remonstrants]] offered him the chair of philosophy in their college at [[Amsterdam]], vacated by the illness of [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Leclerc]], on condition that he clear himself of the suspicion of [[heresy]]. He returned to Basel, and received a reversal (22 March 1732) of the previous decision, and re-admission to all his clerical offices. But, on his becoming a candidate for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] chair at Basel, his [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] opponents blocked his appointment, and he retired to Amsterdam.

At length, he was allowed to instruct the Remonstrant students in philosophy and Hebrew on certain humiliating conditions. For the rest of his life he continued as professor in the Remonstrant college, declining in 1745 the Greek chair at Basel. In 1746 he once more visited England, and collated [[Syriac language|Syriac]] manuscripts for his final, great work. At last this appeared in 1751–1752, in two folio volumes, under the title ''Novum Testamentum Graecum editionis receptae cum lectionibus variantibus codicum'' manuscripts, etc. He did not venture to put new readings in the body of his page, but consigned them to a place between the Textus Receptus and the full list of various readings. Beneath the latter he gave a commentary, consisting principally of a mass of valuable illustrations and parallels drawn from classical and rabbinical literature, which has formed a storehouse for all later commentators. In his ''Prolegomena'' he gave an admirable methodical account of the manuscripts, the versions and the readings of the fathers, as well as the troubled story of the difficulties with which he had had to contend in the prosecution of the work of his life. He was the first to designate uncial manuscripts by Roman capitals, and cursive manuscripts by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] figures. He did not long survive the completion of this work. He died in Amsterdam. 
&lt;!--OUT OF DATE
Wettstein's New Testament has never been republished in its entirety. The London printer, [[William Bowyer]], published, in 1763, a text in which he introduced the readings recommended by Wettstein; [[J. S. Semler]] republished the ''Prolegomena'' and appendix (''Wetstenii libelli ad crisin atque interpretationem Novi Testamenti'', Halle, 1764); [[A. Lotze]] commenced a new edition of the work, but the ''Prolegomena'' only appeared later (Rotterdam, 1831), and this with much negative criticism --&gt;

===Work===
Wettstein rendered service to textual criticism by his collection of various readings and his methodical account of the manuscripts and other sources.

Through his laborious study of [[Codex Alexandrinus]], he found misinterpretations or calculated mistakes of New Testament written in Greek that question the very basis of Christianity. For example, the misreading of Greek word "God" with "who", so the passage from the book of I Timothy no longer read: "Christ as God made manifest in the flesh, and justified in Spirit", but instead read: "Christ who was made manifest in the flesh, and justified in Spirit". This finding, and some others led him to question his faith in the Divinity of Christ, which is evidenced by his later works.

Some opponents considered his work to be less valuable because of his prejudice against the Latin version and the principle of grouping manuscripts in families which had been recommended by Richard Bentley and [[Johann Albrecht Bengel|J. A. Bengel]].

See Wettstein's account of his labours and trials in his ''Nov. Test. i.'': 1751. ''Novum Testamentum Græcum editionis receptæ, cum Lectionibus Variantibus Codicum MSS., Editionum aliarum, Versionum et Patrum, necnon Commentario pleniore ex Scriptoribus veteribus, Hebræis, Græcis, et Latinis, historiam et vim verborum illustrante'', in two volumes. Amsterdam: Amstelædami. Reprinted in 1962 by Graz, Austria: Akademische Druck-u. Verlagsanstalt.

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29241">'''Latin manuscripts of the New Testament''' are handwritten copies of translations from the Greek originals. Translations of the New Testament are called ''versions''. They are important in [[textual criticism]], because sometimes versions provide evidence (called a ''witness'') to an earlier reading of the Greek, i.e. to the text that may have been lost (or preserved only very poorly) in the subsequent Greek tradition. It is also hypothesised that, in some cases, for example, in the case of the [[Codex Bezae]], early Latin manuscripts may have influenced some early Greek manuscripts. Thus, accidentally or deliberately, some Latin readings may have "crossed back over" into the Greek. One possible example of this is the well known [[Comma Johanneum]].

Latin manuscripts are divided into "Old Latin" and [[Vulgate]]. Old Latin manuscripts, also called ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' or ''Itala'', are so called not because they are written in [[Old Latin]] (i.e. Latin prior to 75 BC), but because they are the oldest versions of the New Testament in Latin. From the linguistic point of view, Old Latin New Testament manuscripts may at times use non-standard grammar and vocabulary.

Unlike the Vulgate, the Vetus Latina tradition reflects numerous distinct, similar, and not entirely independent translations of various New Testament texts, extending back to the time of the original Greek autographs.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no such thing as a uniform version of the New Testament in Latin prior to Jerome's Vulgate". Elliott (1997:202).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 382 AD [[Jerome]] began a revision of the existing Vetus Latina into contemporary Latin, corrected against manuscripts in the original Greek and Hebrew. [[List of New Testament Latin manuscripts#Jerome's version|Jerome's version]] is known as the [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, UBS4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clarification ==
=== Identification ===

The list of Old Latin manuscripts below is based on citations in ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (NA27) and ''The Greek New Testament'' ([[United Bible Societies|UBS]]4). Each manuscript is identified first by its [[Scribal abbreviation|siglum]] (the first column, '''s.''', in the table), as given by the [[critical apparatus]] of the editions mentioned. These sigla are related to content, so are not unique. For example, the letter ''t'' refers to Codex Bernensis in the [[gospel]]s, but [[Liber Comicus]] elsewhere. So sigla need disambiguation. In the table below, this is done by providing a full name. Additionally, the standard unique serial number for each manuscript is provided. Taken together sigla, name and number provide unambiguous identification, and some further information regarding the content, history and relationship of manuscripts.

Sigla, names and numbers exist to serve different scholastic purposes. Sigla, in the context of reference to an ''original'' document, provide unique and concise identification of witnesses to the text of that original, suited to minimizing the space taken by citation in a critical apparatus. Names, on the other hand, normally refer to specific handwritten ''volumes'' (often including other text), either as originally bound or in their current form. Names are typically Latin, and can refer to the place of composition ([[Abbey library of Saint Gall|Codex Sangallensis]], "Book from [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]]") or rediscovery ([[Stonyhurst Gospel]]), the current location (Liber Ardmachanus, "[[Book of Armagh]]"), a famous owner (Codex Bezae, "[[Theodore Beza]]'s Book"), a volume's function (Liber Comicus, "The Lectionary"), or can even refer to physical characteristics of a volume ([[Codex Gigas]], "The Huge Book" or [[Codex Aureus (disambiguation)|Codex Aureus]], "The Gold Book"). The [[Book of Mulling]] is also known as Liber Moliensis after the name of the scribe, as tradition has it.

==== Beuron numbers ====

The [[Beuron Archabbey|Beuron]] Ancient Latin Institute (''Vetus Latina Institut'') has introduced a new numerical system for Old Latin manuscripts, of which there are about 90 altogether. These ''Beuron numbers'' are designed to provide unambiguous identification of witnesses in academic usage, yet they are not used very widely in general literature, as they may cause confusion with the Greek minuscule manuscripts.

Beuron Institute allocated numbers up to 100 to all existing Old Latin manuscripts, depending on what parts of NT they include, and how old their text is. The lowest numbers are allocated to the gospels, and to the most complete manuscripts. For example, Codex Bezae (d) is a witness for the Gospels (Gosp), the [[Book of Acts]] and the [[General epistles]] (Gen), and is allocated number 5.
* Manuscripts 1-49 are witnesses to one or more Gospels.
* Manuscripts 50-74 are witnesses to Acts, General epistles or the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev).
* Manuscripts 75-89 are witnesses to [[Pauline epistles]] (Paul).
* Manuscripts 91-96 are [[Bible gloss|gloss]]es in Spanish Bibles.

=== Other issues ===

NA27 and UBS4 interact with the Vulgate witness only at the level of critical editions, not at the level of manuscripts themselves. The manuscripts that provide evidence of Jerome's version are identified in the apparatus of ''Biblia Sacra Vulgata'' (the [[Vulgate#Weber-Gryson (Stuttgart) edition|Stuttgart edition of the Vulgate]]).

In practice, citation of manuscript evidence implies any of several methodologies. The ideal, but most costly, method is physical inspection of the manuscript itself; alternatively, published photographs or [[facsimile]] editions may be inspected. This method involves [[Paleography|paleographical]] analysis—interpretation of handwriting, incomplete letters and even reconstruction of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]]. More typically, editions of manuscripts are consulted, which have done this paleographical work already. The lists below note the names of the editors of standard editions of the manuscripts listed. As a last resort, sometimes a critical edition of NT, that cites readings of a manuscript in its apparatus, may be offered as authority for the text of the manuscript at these points.

It must also be observed that certain Latin NT manuscripts may present a mixture of Vulgate and Old Latin texts. For example, [[Codex Sangermanensis]] (g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ) is Old Latin in Matthew, but Vulgate in the rest of the Gospels. Also, the text of John in Codex Veronensis is believed to be part Old Latin and part Vulgate. Hence, some codices are cited as manuscript witnesses ''both'' to the Vetus Latina and to the Vulgate.

== Old Latin ==

The table below employs the following conventions.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 50 year increment.
* Content is given to the nearest book (sometimes chapter); verses and lacunae are not listed.
* Editions are those consulted by UBS4; in many cases, better editions are also available.
* Locations are given in [[anglicisation|anglicised]] form, unless linked to sources in other languages.
* Manuscripts will sometimes be referred to as "it" followed by the siglum.

'''Manuscript culture''' uses [[manuscript]]s to store and disseminate information; in the West, it generally preceded the age of [[printing]]. In early manuscript culture, monks copied manuscripts by hand. They copied not just religious works, but a variety of texts including some on astronomy, [[herbals]], and [[bestiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|page=251|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval manuscript culture deals with the transition of the manuscript from the monasteries to the market in the cities, and the rise of universities. Manuscript culture in the cities created jobs built around the making and trade of manuscripts, and typically was regulated by universities. Late manuscript culture was characterized by a desire for uniformity, well-ordered and convenient access to the text contained in the manuscript, and ease of reading aloud. This culture grew out of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) and the rise of the [[Devotio Moderna]]. It included a change in materials (switching from vellum to paper), and was subject to remediation by the printed book, while also influencing it.

== Medieval manuscript culture ==

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:مخطوطات عربية قديمة.jpg|thumb|Arabic Manuscripts from the 18th century]]
Manuscript culture seems to have really begun around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo-Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|pages=250–268|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say however, that manuscripts and the recording of information was not important prior to the 10th century, but that during the 10th century, historians see an influx and heavier weight placed on these manuscripts. This was a time when medical practitioners were advancing what they knew about the human body and the way that certain substances interacted with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-48233-2|pages=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These medical practitioners recorded this information and passed it on through the means of literate people. Catholic [[monasteries]] and [[cathedrals]] during the Middle Ages were centers of learning (see [[cathedral schools]]), so it would only make sense for these texts to end up in the hands of the monks.

These monks would meticulously record the information presented in the texts, but not mindlessly. In the case of herbals, for instance, there is evidence that the monks improved upon some texts, retracted textual errors, and made the text particularly relevant to the area in which they lived. Some monasteries even went so far as to grow some of the plants included in the texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and Anglo Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|pages=250–252|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was due in part to their intimate understanding of their local herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Beginnings of Western Science|first=Lindberg|title=David|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important to note because it demonstrated the practical uses of these text in the lives of the monks. They had little room, or patience for that matter, to disseminate the imaginary plants and fanciful texts that are so commonly imagined in the minds of those who think of this era. The writers truly restricted themselves to only include practical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1978|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=430–431}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time when plants and botany was linked very closely with medicine and [[herbal remedies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of bestiaries, similarly to herbals, the monks generally copied and cited previous texts to pass them on. Unlike the herbals, the monks could not grow an animal in their garden, so largely the information taken from the bestiaries was taken at face value. The consequence of this is that the writers were free to elaborate and embellish upon texts. This was a definite and deliberate attempt to give the animal in question a certain moral or allegorical meaning beyond the physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1978|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bestiary texts can be very like traditional mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=354–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade ===
In the 13th century, [[Paris]] was the first city to have a large commercial trade of manuscripts, with manuscript-book producers being commissioned to make specific books for specific people. Paris had a large enough population of wealthy literate persons to support the livelihood of people producing manuscripts. This medieval era marks the shift in manuscript production from monks in monasteries to booksellers and scribes making a living from their work in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Nicolas, and British Library. ''A Potencie of Life : Books in Society : The Clark Lectures 1986–1987, British Library Studies in the History of the Book.'' London: British Library, 1993. p. 45-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flourished initial "L" from a medieval manuscript.jpeg|thumb|left|Flourished initial L&lt;ref&gt;http://wally.rit.edu/cary/cc_db/manuscripts/43a.jpeg&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Individuals did scribal work, but collaboration has been suggested.  Commercial [[workshops]] or ateliers operated out of Paris during this time, often collaborating on jobs.  Research from François Avril, Joan Diamond and others has confirmed that two or more [[artists]] alternated, or otherwise shared, in the illumination of a single manuscript; however, the detailed logistics of this work remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most medieval [[scribes]] gathered together as they copied, but some separated books into sections to copy them in parts.  Previously in the monasteries, work was broken up between scribes and [[Limner|illuminators]]; examples exist where the scribe would leave space for and write out a small cursive letter at the beginning of a new paragraph, which was then painted in at a later time by the illuminator.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel, Christopher. ''The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1988. p. 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pecia system ===

The pecia system was developed in [[Italy|Italian]] university cities by the beginning of the thirteenth century and became a regulated procedure at the [[University of Paris]] in the second half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Richard H., and Mary A. Rouse. ''Manuscripts and Their Makers : Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris'', 1200–1500. 2 vols, Illiterati Et Uxorati. Turnhout, Belgium: Harvey Miller, 2000. p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The pecia system broke up the book into sections called peciae.  Individuals — such as students — would rent them, section by section, to copy.  The peciae were generally four folios long which allowed for a fast turn-over rate for each pecia for students to exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, B. L., "La Pecia dans les manuscrits universitaires du XIII  e et du XIV  e siecle." Rev. of La Pecia, by Jean Destrez. ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 33, No. 2. Apr. 1938: pp. 238-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, a larger number of copiers, working simultaneously, could produce a copy in a significantly shorter amount of time than a single person working alone.

[[File:c7463-01a.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of pecia mark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&amp;IllID=13853|title=Image of an item from the British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts|first=C|last=Wight|date=|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The original collection of peciae for a book from which all future copies will be based is called the exemplar.  The process of making an exemplar was supposed to be an orderly procedure: Masters of the university who compiled a new work were to edit, correct, and submit this authentic text to a stationer; he in turn copied from it an exemplar in peciae, corrected these against the [[author| author’s]] text with utmost care, and finally submitted them to the inspection of the university’s delegates for approval and for the setting of a rental price. Only then were peciae available for rental and copy.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Mary A., and Richard H. Rouse. ''Authentic Witnesses : Approaches to Medieval Texts and Manuscripts'', Publications in Medieval Studies ; 17 Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1991. p.303.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, it came down to the [[stationer]] — part of whose job was renting out peciae — finding and offering for rental the works which he thought would be demanded. This pressure on the stationers prompted them to acquire exemplars in as good a state and in as short a time as possible. The emphasis was on speed of acquisition instead of the quality of the product. If a certain work seemed likely to become a “best seller,” a stationer would make a copy of the best text immediately available, and would have his exemplar-peciae corrected as well as time permitted. At times, the stationer sought the text; at other times, it was the author who offered his newly completed work to the stationer, but it was never the university as a formal body which made requests or developed what was to be offered.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Booksellers in Paris ===
[[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair of France]], 1285–1314, instituted a .4% commercial [[tax]] on all goods.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1307 the King exempted all the ''librarii universitatis'' from paying the commercial tax, the taille. This exemption privileged the French universities over the booksellers because if they did not swear the oath they would not be exempt from the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scriptorium - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|thumb|left| Paul Pierce within an illustration of a Mediæval Scriptorium. From a manuscript of a Book of Prayers. 15th Century. British Museum, Slo. 2468.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Benham]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16531 ''Old St. Paul's Cathedral'' - Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Librarius'' is a general term while ''stationarius'' refers to one specific kind of librarius. ''Librarius'' can mean anything from scribe to bookseller to [[librarian]]. ''Stationarius'' or stationer refers to those types of ''librarius'' who rented out peciae. Both types, however, were involved in the secondhand trade, produced new books, and were regulated by the university.  The sole distinction between them was the stationer's added service of renting out pecia.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.261-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restrictions ====

The oaths that the ''librarii'' or booksellers had to swear to the [[university|universities]] to obey their regulations and requirements for the tax exemption were extremely restrictive in regard to the resale of secondhand books. They were supposed to act more like intermediaries between the seller and the buyer while their profit was limited to essentially four pence per pound. They were further required to display the secondhand books prominently in their shops, give a professional assessment of the likely price of the books submitted to them, and put would-be buyers in direct contact with the seller.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bookseller had to swear not to underpay when buying and not to overcharge when selling. The stationers rented out copies of useful texts, one [[Paper quire|quire]] at a time, so students and masters could make their own copies. Both fees were regulated by the university.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.52-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Both kinds of booksellers had to guarantee their compliance to their oath by posting a bond of 100 [[pence]].&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:irwin1.jpg|thumb|right|A monk inspecting a sheet of parchment
which he is buying from a parchment-maker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hortulus.net/may06lf/irwin.html|title=Hortulus: The Online Graduate Journal of Medieval Studies|author=|date=|website=hortulus.net|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was not just the booksellers which the universities regulated. Additionally, university regulations forbade parchmenters from hiding the good [[parchment]] from university members wanting to buy. There were plenty of other demands for parchment outside the university such as: the record-keeping for the royal government, every similar entity of a commercial or mercantile [[guild]], every religious house that issued a [[charter]] or kept a rent roll, every public letter-writer, everyone from major international trader to local shop-keeper who kept accounts. They all demanded parchment in greater numbers and were willing to pay higher than the regulated price which the university members paid. And so, the universities feeling such pressures often chose to regulate parchment as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Benefits ====

While there were many restrictions on the bookseller, the job did have its benefits. The bookseller was free to produce and sell books, illuminate, or write for anyone they pleased like the Court, cathedral, or the wealthy [[laymen]] of the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and [[provinces]] so long as they met their obligations to the university to which they had sworn oaths. In fact, most of their trade fell outside of the university regulation. There is an important distinction between the regulation of how books were traded within the university and how the booksellers were able to charge whatever the open market would bear. To the non-student or masters, there were no such restrictions on the booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.269.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1300–1500, the position of libraire was a closed position only open upon the resignation or death of a previous one. Aside from cheap books, it was only the libraire who was allowed to sell books in Paris. The university essentially guaranteed a monopoly on the sale of books for booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late Manuscript Culture ==

===Characteristics===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean Miélot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]
The period of "Late Manuscript Culture" dates from roughly the mid-fourteenth century to the fifteenth century, preceding and existing alongside the printing press.  While embodying all of the ideals and adhering to the regulations observable in the [[Devotio Moderna]], there are many clear characteristics of Late Manuscript Culture.  For instance, careful attention was paid to the punctuation and layout of texts, with readability and specifically reading aloud taking preeminence. Meaning had to be clear in every sentence, with as little room left to interpretation as possible (compared to the lack of spaces in text and any markings for the purpose of aiding in enunciation), due to preachings' rise in popularity after the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].  Correct [[orthography]] was attempted whenever the necessary exemplars made it possible to emend earlier texts, especially Bibles, and this correction made many texts uniform.  In this period of Manuscript Culture, the emendatiora, manuscripts which combined surviving texts of the oldest available exemplars with the manuscripts that had been currently acceptable and prominent, were created.&lt;ref&gt;
Rouse, Mary A., and Richard H. Rouse. Authentic Witnesses : Approaches to Medieval Texts and Manuscripts, Publications in Medieval Studies ; 17, p. 447-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aids to find one's way about the text are prominent features in these manuscripts.  While none were invented solely in fifteenth century, they were used with increasing frequency and became more complex. These include:

* tables of contents
* lists of chapters, either at the beginning of each book or gathered at the beginning of the whole work (if it is a collection of works)
* running headlines
* extensively detailed [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]]
* page numbers in [[Arabic numerals]].
* the appearance of subject indexes&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte.  The Codex in the Fifteenth Century. Manuscript and Print. Barker, Nicolas, ed. and British Library. A Potencie of Life : Books in Society : The Clark Lectures 1986–1987, British Library Studies in the History of the Book. London: British Library, 1993. p. 63-84. Rouse, 1991. p. 452-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other changes included the enlargement of the [[rubric]] from one to two lines in the university manuscript to eight or ten, and the distinction of it by separate letter-form.  The rubric also changed in regard to the categories of information included in it. An earlier rubric might have contained a title of the particular section or article, and a description of the ending of the preceding one.  A fifteenth century rubric would add information about the translator or translators, and the original writer if they were not particularly well known. A brief description of their content, or even detailed information considering the date or conditions of the works creation is also occasionally seen, though not as frequently. These changes exemplify the desire for uniformity, ease of access, and strict regulation of a given work and its subsequent correction.  These are many of the same goals attributed to the uniformity exemplified by the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p. 452-457&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production of manuscripts at the beginning of the fifteenth century ===

The emergence of new standards in manuscript production, beginning in the [[Low Countries]] at the end of the fourteenth century, clearly marked the beginning of a new epoch in manuscript culture. Uniformity would result from the desire for clarity, both in terms of bibliographic accuracy and the reproduction and correction of the text itself.  It necessitated greater organization, specifically within the monastic [[scriptoria]].  These had lost pre-eminence in medieval manuscript culture, characterized by the university, but had begun to undergo a rebirth in the fourteenth century.  Historians have characterized this period as chaotic, with very poor quality paper manuscripts being held as a standard.  However, the varying quality of materials did not affect the quality of the text contained on it, as the transition was made from parchment to rag paper. For instance, there was the formation of a new script, called hybrida, that sought to combine the traditional cursiva script with the script used in printed books.  There was little loss of legibility, due to the use of sharp angles instead of loops.  Additionally, in the first half of the fifteenth century, the practice of using a hierarchy of scripts to demarcate different sections of a text was re-instituted.  Rubrics and colophons were clearly set off from the remainder of a text, employing their own unique script.  All of these changes resulted from a desire for improved accuracy, and led to the creation of complex codification rules.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 450-452&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniformity amidst variety ===

Many manuscripts were produced that had differences in terms of size, layout, script, and illumination.  They were based on the same text while being created by many different scribes.  Yet, they were meticulously corrected, to the point that very few differences in terms of the text itself can be observed among them.  This implied not only the presence of a direct authority that maintained some sort of direction over the scribes, but also a newfound pursuit of scholarly accuracy that had not been present with the university book sellers. It was emphasized by the new religious orders that had been created in the fourteenth century.  Correction and emendation would be held in the same esteem as copying itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 427-440&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Codification rules and the Opus Pacis ===

Written in 1428 by the German [[Carthusian]], Oswald de Corda, prior of the Grand Chartreuse, the Opus Pacis consisted of two parts.  One dealt primarily with orthography and accent, where Oswald stated that his motive in creating these codification rules was to dispel the anxiety of his fellow [[Carthusians]].  Many members of the order were worried about the omission of single letters, not just phrases, words or syllables within copies of a given text (demonstrating the new concern for uniformity taken to an extreme).  It is clear that his audience was composed of [[scribes]], specifically those meticulous to “the verge of neurosis”.  He seeks to reinforce the importance of older statutes regarding manuscript production, such as the Carthusian statutes, and the way in which he seeks to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, 450-457&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Statuta Nova of 1368 ====

Oswald specifically wanted to reform the Statuta Nova of 1368. It stated no one could emend copies of the Old and New Testament, unless they were doing so against exemplars that had been prescribed by their order.  Anyone who corrected texts in a manner inconsistent with those exemplars was publicly acknowledged to have corrupted the text, and subsequently punished.  Oswald answered this with his Work of Peace, and stated that correctors should not engage in pointless labor by over-correcting.  In it, he described correction not as a command, but an indulgence. It was practiced for the improvement and glorification of a text, and though it followed a set of rules, they were not so strict as to stifle emendation.  This was a transition from older works with large amounts of lists and regulations that mandated every action a scribe could take in correction, and had been widely ignored in medieval print culture.  Oswald rejected a system in which one must simply pick a single exemplar and correct according to it, or reproduce portions of texts which the scribe knew to be in error due to a proper exemplar not being attainable. Before Oswald, many believed these were the only available options under the older, strict rules.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 440-452&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New rules of corrections ====

Oswald specifically made sure to outline the proper way of correcting various readings of the same text, as observed in varying exemplars.  He stated that scribes shouldn't instantly correct according to one or the other, but deliberate, and use proper judgment.  Oswald also said that in the case of bibles, scribes should not immediately modernize archaic spellings, because this had produced further variation within texts. Oswald also detailed a uniform set of abbreviations. However, he stated that scribes should recognize national differences, particularly in light of the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]].  Scribes were right to correct texts with different dialects of [[Latin]], especially if they were using archaic forms of Latin verbs, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hist.msu.ru/Departments/Medieval/Cappelli/ Rouse 1991, p. 440-452&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Valde Bonum ====

In his prologue to the Opus Pacis, Oswald contrasts his work with the Valde Bonum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=76416 A 14th/15th century, German Valde Bonum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213323/http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=76416 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier handbook compiled during the Great Schism.  It had attempted to set forth universal spellings for the [[Bible]], and stated that the corrector need not emend to conform to an exemplar from a given region based on its perceived superiority, but could rather take local regional practice as a standard.  It acknowledged that centuries of use, and transmission from nation to nation, had an effect on various spellings.  He incorporated many of these elements into his Opus Pacis, which was copied and put to practical use, and had spread from [[Germany]] as far north as [[Ireland]].  By the 1480s, it had become a standard, specifically for the Devotio Moderna and the Reformed [[Benedictines]]. Opus Pacis became a generic term for any work of its kind.  The last surviving copy was written in 1514, indicating that manuscript correction remained an important subject sixty years into the printed era.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 440-448&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manuscript as a vehicle for preaching ===

It was in Late Manuscript Culture that the written page took on a renewed meaning to religious communities.  Scriptorias of Benedictine, Cisterican and Augustinaian houses had resumed after being suppressed by the production of university and mendicant books.  Particularly, these scriptoria exemplified the idea that one shall live by the fruit of one's labors.  Writing sacred books was the most fitting, suitable and pious task that one could undertake to do so.  Also, copying these books was equivalent to preaching with ones hands.  Sermons were only of moderate importance in the 13th century. By the 15th century, after the emphasis placed on preaching in the Fourth Lateran Council, they were of the utmost importance.  The formation and expansion of preaching orders led to the proliferation of pastoral theology in schools, and preaching was now an indispensable part of the sacraments.  Uniform manuscripts with many tools made for ease of reference, reading, and enunciation became necessary.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 452-456&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devotio Moderna and the reformed Benedictines relied on reading devotional texts for instruction, and the written word was raised to a high level of importance not afforded by earlier religious movements.   The writing was just as important as the word.  In fact, monasteries bought many printed books, becoming the main market for the early printing press, precisely because of this devotion to preaching.  Without the Devotio Moderna and orders that followed their example, the need for texts and printers would not have been present. Printing had exploded in [[Germany]] and the Low Countries, the home of the Devotio Moderna and Reformed Benedictines, as opposed to [[England]] and [[France]]. They were also the home to the beginnings of Late Manuscript Culture, because of the common desire for uniformity. Trimethius protested the invasion of the [[library]] by the printed book because of the missing aspect of devotion that had been present in preaching with ones' hands.  With the preaching possible as a scribe, manuscripts had a function that was lacking in a printed book, though both possessed a greater degree of uniformity than earlier manuscripts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Manuscripts and the arrival of print ===

By roughly 1470, the transition from [[Penmanship|handwritten]] books to printed ones had begun.  The book trade, in particular, underwent drastic changes.  By this point German printing presses had reached the northernmost regions of [[Europe]], specifically Paris.  By 1500, print had stopped imitating manuscripts and manuscripts were imitating print.  In the reign of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515–1547) for instance, the king's handwritten manuscripts were based on Roman type.  While quality rag paper had appeared before the arrival of the printing press, it was at this time that parchmenters lost most of their business.  Paper was not only acceptable, it was preferable, and printers and scribes had both ceased to use parchment altogether.  Many libraries decried these changes, because of the loss in individuality and subtlety that resulted.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte, p. 63–81 Rouse, Richard H., and Mary A. Rouse. ''Manuscripts and Their Makers : Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris, 1200–1500''. 2 vols, Illiterati Et Uxorati. Turnhout, Belgium: Harvey Miller, 2000. p. 328-329&lt;/ref&gt; Many printed books and manuscripts were even created with the same paper.  The same watermarks are often observable on them, that signified the particular paper dealer who created it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ksbm.oeaw.ac.at/_scripts/php/wzma.php wzma.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611161722/http://www2.ksbm.oeaw.ac.at/_scripts/php/wzma.php |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts were still written and illuminated well into the sixteenth century, some dating to just before 1600.  Many illuminators continued to work on various manuscripts, specifically the [[Book of Hours]].  The Book of Hours had been the most commonly produced manuscript from the 1450s onward, and was among the last manuscripts created.  By the sixteenth century, however, manuscripts were mostly illuminated by artists retained by nobles or royals.  Their work was required (and manuscripts were created) only for unusual occasions, such as noble or royal births, weddings, or other extraordinary occurrences.  The number of copyists had greatly declined, as these types of manuscripts were not intended for mass, or even student, consumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Hellinga, Lotte. p. 63-79'' Rouse 2000, p. 329-331&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional organization of book production fell apart; they were made up of libraries doling out quires to scribes and illuminators, who lived in proximity.  The new, specialized system based on patronage didn't support them.  Libraries, and not scribes, turned into printers, and served as a link between late manuscript culture and print culture.  They had possessed reserves of manuscripts, and slowly supplemented them with printed books, until printed books dominated their collections. However, the cost and risks involved in making books greatly increased with the transition to print. Still, Paris and more northern areas of Europe (especially France) had been the foremost center of manuscript production, and remained a force in the printed book market, falling only behind Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte. p. 63-72 Rouse 2000, p. 329–332&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manuscript descent and exemplars ====

There were accounts{{By whom|date=February 2011}} of scribes working in a similar manner in comparison to their rival printers, though the process was still subtly different.  The pages on sheets of vellum were folded together to form a quire before the invention of printing or paper, and printed books also bound multiple quires to form a codex. They were simply made of paper.  Manuscripts were also used as exemplars for printed books. Lines were counted off based on the exemplar and marked in advance, while the typesetting reflected the layout of the manuscript's text.  Within a few generations, however, printed books were used as new exemplars. This process created various “family trees”, as many printed sources would be double checked against earlier manuscripts if the quality was deemed too low.  This necessitated the creation of stemma, or lines of descent among books. This made manuscripts gain a new significance, as sources to find earlier authority or a better authority, in comparison to the published version of a text.  [[Erasmus]], for instance, attained authoritative manuscripts from the medieval period due to his dissatisfaction with printed Bibles.

=== Christine de Pizan and humanist illumination ===

The Epistre Othea or Letter of Othea to Hector,  composed in 1400, symbolized the murky transition from manuscript culture to the Renaissance and humanistic print culture.  It was a retelling of the classical story of Othea through an illuminated manuscript, though it conveyed many humanistic Renaissance ideas.  Created by [[Christine de Pizan]], its patron was Louis of Orleans, heir to the French throne.  It contained over 100 images, and each chapter opened with the image of a mythological figure or event.  It also contained short narrative verses, and text addressed to Hector.  Each prose passage contained a labeled gloss, and attempted to interpret a humanistic lesson from the myth.  Every gloss closed with a quote from an ancient philosopher.  Additionally, other short prose passages called allegories concluded a section. They conveyed lessons applicable to the soul, and a Latin Bible quotation.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond, Marilynn and Pamela Sheingorn. Myth, montage, &amp; visuality in late medieval manuscript culture : Christine de Pizan’s Epistre Othea. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2003. p. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine de Pizan combined contemporary images through illumination with new humanistic values typically associated with print.  Her work was based on [[Ovid]]'s, and many Ovidian myths were traditionally illuminated, in the medieval period.  She also incorporated astrology, Latin texts, and a wide variety of classical mythology in fleshing out Ovid's account, maintaining her humanist motivations.  This contradiction also led to the use of illuminatio, or the practice of using light as color.  Her Othea is a [[bricolage]], restructuring tradition while not trying to create a new master work.  It was done in the style of an ordinatio, or layout that emphasized the meaning of the organization of images.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond and Sheingorn, p.1-192&lt;/ref&gt;

The Othea reflected a late manuscript culture that was defined by violence, action, and gender challenges within literature. Anger was depicted in relation to gender, and marked “a departure from the Aristotelian tradition”.   Women were no longer driven into mindless frenzies, but possessed anger that developed from fully considered character interactions.  The Epistre Othea remained Christine's most popular work, despite the fact that multiple versions existed.  Because of the fluid nature of manuscript reproduction, specifically in the case of illumination (as opposed to the text), the visual experience was not uniform. Each exemplar incorporated diverse cultural elements, with many having entirely different philosophical and theological implications.  Only later reproductions that used woodcuts to reproduce the images created a truly authorial version of the manuscript.  It also owed its  very existence to the printing press in the first instance, because bibles were now relegated to the press, leaving nonreligious texts available for detailed illumination.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond and Sheingorn, p. 192-241&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructing an Auctor with Chaucer ===

====William Caxton====
While using medieval manuscripts as exemplars, many printers attempted to implant humanist values into the text. They attempted to create a uniform work, displaying many similarities in terms of motivation with the Devotio Moderna.  Early editors and publishers needed definitive works to define a culture.  [[William Caxton]] (1415~1424-1492), an editor, was instrumental in shaping English culture and language, and did so through his authoritative Works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=111051 A 14th/15th century, Caxton era Works of Chaucer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213202/http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=111051 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caxton was a transitional figure, who sought to close the gap between manuscript culture and a more humanistic print culture through Chaucer's work.  Specifically, Caxton attempted to make Chaucer appear similar to classical writers and continental poets.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Lauryn S.. Words made flesh: reading medieval manuscript culture. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. p. 121-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chaucer as humanist ====

Caxton attempted to make Chaucer into an English [[Petrarch]] or [[Virgil]], and realized that new humanistic sixteenth century versions of his work had to recognize fourteenth century versions.  His Chaucer transcended medieval ideals, and became timeless, conforming to humanistic ideals.  This required construction of a literary genealogy referred to older medieval exemplars.  Through his editing, Chaucer was framed as an early promoter of the Renaissance, who decried Gothic and medieval culture, and who rescued the English language.

{{Rquote|left|he by hys labour enbelysshyd/ornated and made faire our englisshe/in thys Royame was had rude speche &amp; Incongrue/as yet it appiereth by olde bookes/whych at thys day ought not to haue place ne be compared emong ne to hys beauteuous volumes/and aournate writynges|Mayer, p. 123 |William Caxton}}

&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 121-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caxton and the flaws of "Olde Bookes" ====

Caxton wanted to discard “old bookes” that were characteristic of medieval culture.  To do this, he modernized older terms and introduced Latinate spellings.  He removed the influence of manuscript culture, that allowed the reader to have some textual authority.  Caxton believed that printed books could set a defined authorship, in which the reader would not feel it appropriate to change the text or add glosses.  He believed that cheap versions of this authorial Chaucer would allow a diverse group of readers to develop common economic and political ideals, unifying the culture of England.  He was the exemplum for the English standard.  His version of Chaucer was well liked by [[Henry VII of England]], who decided to spread it in order to help provide England with a common cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 132-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Changing perceptions of the book ====

To most people in the late age of manuscript culture,  books were codices first, vehicles for text, regardless of whether they were printed or handwritten.  The cost of obtaining them determined the standard, and printed books gradually gained precedence.  William Caxton stated that his readers could have them “good cheap”, and that the quality of text was improved, if not equaled, in print. Many catalogues from the period do list both kinds indiscriminately.  However, in auctions a careful distinction was made between the two, as anything handwritten fetched a higher price.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte, p. 64-84&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular assumptions and historical revision ===

Many scholars of [[print culture]], as well as [[classicists]], have argued that inconsistencies existed among manuscripts due to the blind copying of texts and a static manuscript culture that (specifically medieval manuscript culture) existed during the rise of the printing press.  They have stated that once a mistake was made, it would be repeated endlessly and compounded with further mistakes by refusing to deviate from the previous exemplar, thus exposing an obvious advantage of print. The noted classicist E.J. Kenney, whose work formed much of the early scholarship on this issue, stated that  “medieval authors, scribes, and readers had no notion of emending a text, when they were confronted with an obvious error in their exemplars, other than by slavishly copying the readings of another text”. There was a great diversity among them in terms of changes in style and a willingness to deviate from prior exemplars, however, as observed in [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/jpegs/lat/th/c/1500/03101061.jpg this] copy of [[Jerome]]'s Epistolae Morale, compared to  [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/jpegs/lat/class/c/1500/00700908.jpg this] copy of [[Cicero]]'s Letters, both dating from the 16th century.  Many historians and specifically medievalists argue that the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries demonstrated reforms that accommodated many of the functions associated with print. Also, many classicists naturally looked to reproductions of classical texts during the period, which were not necessarily characteristic of other work that was deemed more important. Universality and uniformity, medievalists believe, was seen among some late manuscripts, along with other changes typically associated with the printed book.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 427-429&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the recent scholarship on Late Manuscript Culture was specifically generated by [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;
Elizabeth Eisenstein, Print as an Agent of Change, 2 vols. (Cambridge: University Press, 1979). p. 328-329&lt;/ref&gt; a key print culture scholar, and arguably creator of the "print culture" model.  Eisenstein  argued that the invention of the printing press eventually led to the Renaissance, and the social conditions necessary for its occurrence.  The printing press allowed readers to free themselves from many limitations of the manuscript.  She did not detail the state of manuscript and scribal culture in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however.  She described in depth the conditions present in Germany at the time of the printing presses' invention in [[Mainz]], and detailed the scribal culture in England and France in order to compare print culture and manuscript culture. She didn't describe Italian humanists in [[Florence]] and renewed religious orders of the Modern Devotion in the Low Countries and Germany.  These included the [[Windesheim Congregation]], of which Oswald de Corda was a member.  Many medievalists, specifically Mary A. Rouse and Richard H. Rouse,  responded by attempting to  create a more detailed account of late manuscript culture, and defined its distinctive characteristics. This is part of the belief that changes occurred during the period that print culture scholars, such as Eisenstein, ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p. 465-466&lt;/ref&gt;

F.|title=Perspectives on culture, technology, and communication: The media ecology tradition|year=2006|publisher=NJ: Hampton|location=Gencarelli|pages=201–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ecology]] in this context refers to the environment in which the medium is used – what they are and how they affect society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Understanding Me:  Lectures and Interviews,'' by Marshall McLuhan, edited by Stephanie McLuhan and David Staines, Foreword by Tom Wolfe.  MIT Press, 2004, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Postman states, "if in biology a 'medium' is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is 'a technology within which a [human] culture grows.'" &lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (2006). Media Ecology Education. Explorations in Media Ecology, 5(1), 5-14. doi:10.1386/eme.5.1.5_1&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Postman|first=Neil|date=|website=Media Ecology Association|publisher=|access-date=2 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and [[communication technology]] is the primary cause of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hakanen|first=Ernest A.|title=Branding the teleself: Media effects discourse and the changing self|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.

Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of "traffic" between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=eea7d6ba-45f9-4434-912c-3d9a2405e153@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Infrastructuralism: Media as Traffic between Nature and Culture.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===Marshall McLuhan===

In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at [[Cambridge University]], a school which pioneered modern literary [[criticism]]. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, [[I.A. Richards]], a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication.&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Philip|title=Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and The Messenger : A Biography|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-63186-5|pages=37–39|edition=Rev Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards believed that "words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as "[[Global village (term)|The Global Village]]" and "[[The Medium Is the Message]]" two of his most well known phrases that encapsulate the theory of Media Ecology.  
[[File:Marshall McLuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Marshall McLuhan]], c. 1936.]]
McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, [[William Empson]], and [[Harold Innis|Harlold Innis]] as an "entrée to the study of media".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that "if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This led to the emergence of his ideas on Media Ecology.

In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/|title=Who was Marshall McLuhan? – The Estate of Marshall McLuhan|website=marshallmcluhan.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie ''[[Annie Hall]]''.

Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that Media Ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Megan|year=2006|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw : Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media'|jstor=40061070|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an excellent debater and public speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marshall McLuhan: The medium and the messenger|last=Marchand|first=Phillip|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|year=1989|isbn=0899194850|location=New York|pages=153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.

=== Neil Postman ===
Inspired by McLuhan, [[Neil Postman]] founded the Program in Media Ecology at [[New York University]] in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "What is Media Ecology." ''Media Ecology Association.'' 2009. Web. 29 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments - like language itself, symbolic environments with in which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "Teaching as a conserving activity." Instructor 89.4 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. "I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context."&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Em. A First Look at Communication Theory. 7th ed. New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill , 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

=== North American, European and Eurasian versions ===
Media ecology is a contested term within [[media studies]] for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/index.html|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Nystrom|first=Christine|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|year=2004|title=A Media Ecology Review|url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v23/v23_2.pdf|journal=Communication Research Trends|volume=23|pages=28–31|issn=0144-4646|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by [[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]]. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polski, M. |author2=Gorman, L.|year=2012|title=Yuri Rozhdestvensky vs. MArshall McLuhan: A triumph vs. a Vortex|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=10 |issue=3–4|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=13566/|doi=10.1386/eme.10.3-4.263_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Polski, M.|year=2013|title=Media Ecology Pedagogy—Art or Techne?|conference=MEA conference|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used "because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuller, Matthew|title=Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|pp=2–3|isbn=9780262062473|series=Leonardo Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following theorists such as [[Felix Guattari]], [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Manuel De Landa]], the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] and [[Jussi Parikka]]) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.

=== Other contributions ===
Along with McLuhan {{Harv|McLuhan|1962}}, Postman {{Harv|Postman|1985}} and [[Harold Innis]], media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of [[Walter Ong]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Eric Havelock]], [[Susanne Langer]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Edward T. Hall]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], and [[Gregory Bateson]].

==Core concepts==

=== Assumptions of the theory ===
* Media are infused in every act and action in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = West|first = Richard|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year = 2010|publisher = Mc Graw Hill|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-07-338507-5|pages = 428–430|edition = 4|author2 = Lynn H. Turner|chapter = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences.
* Media tie the world together.

These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.

===McLuhan's media history===

McLuhan believed there are three inventions that transformed the world: the [[phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet]], the [[printing press]], and the [[telegraph]]. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan split history into four periods:&lt;ref name="epoch" /&gt; the tribal age, the literary age, the print age, and the [[electronic age]] (information age). Throughout the structure of their distinctive methods of communication (e.g., oral, written, printed, electronic), different media arouse patterns in the brain that are distinctive to each and every particular form of communication.&lt;ref name="epoch"&gt;{{cite book|last = McLuhan|first = M.|title = The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects|year = 1967|publisher = HardWired|location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-1-888869-02-6|pages = |author2 = Fiore Q.|author3 = Agel J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal age====

The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age, a time of community because the ear is the dominant sense organ. This is also known as an acoustic era because the senses of hearing, touch, taste, and smell were far more strongly developed than the ability to visualize. During this time, hearing was more valuable because it allowed people to be more immediately aware of their surroundings, which was extremely important for hunting. Everyone hears at the same time making listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this world of surround sound, everything is more immediate, more present, and fosters more passion and spontaneity. During the Tribal Age, hearing was believing.

====Literacy age====

The second age is the Literacy Stage, a time of private detachment because the eye is the dominant sense organ; also known as the visual era. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to read over and over again. Hearing no longer becomes trustworthy; seeing was believing. Even though people read the same words, the act of reading is an individual act of singular focus. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. This is when the invention of the alphabet came about. During this time, when people learned to read, they became independent thinkers.

====Print age====

The third stage is the Print Age, when individual products were mass produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book. It allowed people to carry books, so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from immediacy of their surroundings.

====Electronic age====

Lastly, the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the [[Information Age|information age]], is an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returned us to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. Being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the [[Global village (term)|global village]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Updating the ages ====
[[Robert K. Logan]] is professor emeritus of [[physics]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the [[Ontario College of Art and Design]]. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:
# Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic [[Homo sapiens]])
# Age of orality
# Age of literacy
# Age of electric mass media
# Age of digital interactive media, or 'new media'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding New Media: Extending Marshall McLuhan|last=Logan|first=Robert K.|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781433111266|location=New York|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a "[[participatory culture]]." Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. "If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2a4280c5-20e6-4610-831e-e8e7e7c9ae04@sessionmgr4007|title=AN IPHONE IN EVERY HAND: MEDIA ECOLOGY, COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, AND THE G...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='The medium is the message'===

"The medium is the message"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding media|last = McLuhan|first = Marshall|publisher = Mentor|year = 1964|isbn = 978-0262631594|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.

For example, [[traditional media]] is an extension of the human body, while the [[new media]] is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society.  The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianhong|author2=Guilan Ding|title=SPECIAL COMMENTARY New media as relations|journal=Chinese Journal of Communication|date=November 2009|volume= 2| issue =  3|pages=367–369|url=http://www.informaworld.com|doi=10.1080/17544750903209242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are accustomed to thinking the [[message]] is separate from a [[Medium (website)|medium.]] McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlook the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. "It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.&lt;ref name="Strate"&gt;Strate, Lance. "Studying Media as Media: McLuhan and the Media Ecology Approach." MediaTropes eJournal. 1. (2008): 1-16. Web. 28 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.

Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed.&lt;ref name="Strate" /&gt; With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.

==== The Metaphor ====
The key elements to Media Ecology has been largely attributed to Marshal McLuhan, who coined the statement “the medium is the message.” Levinson furthers McLuhan’s statement by stating that “the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=paul|date=2000|title=McLuhan and Media Ecology|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/levinson01.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=1|pages=17-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to Media Ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scolari|first=Carlos A.|date=2012-04-09|title=Media Ecology: Exploring the Metaphor to Expand the Theory|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/22/2/204/4085708?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–225|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01404.x|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Carlos Scolari states, “the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”. Author Niall Stephan argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of “media ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Niall|date=2014|title=Toward a More Substantive Media Ecology: Postman's Metaphor Versus Posthuman Futures|url=|journal=International Journal of Communications|volume=8|pages=2027-2045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Janet Sternburg|Janet Sternberg]] has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese “yin/ yang” metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions can be distinguished in the field: the “yang” tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on [[intrapersonal communication]] and the “yin” tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v3/Sternberg03.pdf|title=The Yin and Yang of Media Ecology|last=Sternberg|first=Janet|date=2002|year=|website=MEA Convention Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Connection to general systems theory ====
While [[general systems theory]] originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as "one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://summit.is4is.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/logan3text.pdf|title=General Systems Theory and Media Ecology: Parallel Disciplines that Inform Each Other|date=June 2015|doi=10.1386/eme.14.1-2.39_1|author=Robert Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology "cross pollinate each other" in that,  "a general system is a medium" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are "quasi-deterministic".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, "A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Global village ===
Marshall McLuhan used the phrase [[Global village (term)|global village]] to describe that "humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous [[electronic media]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing communication theory: analysis and application|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073385075|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' saying, "Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremblay|first1=Gaetan|title=From Marshall McLuhan to Harold Innis, or From the Global Village to the World Empire|journal=Canadian Journal of Communications|date=2012|volume=37|issue=4|page=572|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2662/2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.

This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Walkosz, Barbara J.|author2=Tessa Jolls|author3= Mary Ann Sund|title=Global/Local: Media Literacy for the Global Village|work=Medialit.org|conference= Proc. of International Media Literacy Research Forum, London|publisher=OfCom|year=2008|url=http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/33_globallocal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-66-issue-4/herarticle/redefining-the-value-of-school_287|title=The Harvard Educational Review - HEPG|website=hepg.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists R. Buckminster Fuller who once said, "I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/spaceshipearth|title=Spaceship Earth {{!}} The Buckminster Fuller Institute|website=www.bfi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Dixon, Violet|date=2009-01-01|title=Understanding the Implications of a Global Village|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/61/understanding-the-implications-of-a-global-village|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=1|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize [[globalization]] within society. Michael Plugh writes, "[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global village: Globalization through a media ecology lens|date=2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|issue=3-4|pages=219–235|doi=10.1386/eme.13.3-4.219_1|author=Plugh, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, "Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Hot vs. cool media===
McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall, and Quentin Fiore. "The medium is the message." New York 123 (1967): 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot media]] refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. [[Cool media]] describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and fill in information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding media: The Extension of Man|year=1994|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-63159-4|author2=Lewis H. Lapham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Innis: The Philosophical Historian. An Exchange of Ideas Between Prof. Marshall McLuhan and Prof. Eric A. Havelock," recorded at Innis College, Toronto, October 14, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Eye'': left hemisphere (hot) controls right side of the body; visual; speech; verbal; analytical; mathematical; linear; detailed; sequential; controlled; intellectual; dominant worldly;quantitative; active; sequential ordering
* ''Ear:'' right hemisphere (cool) controls the left side of the body; spatial; musical; acoustic; holistic; artistic; symbolic; simultaneous; emotional; creative; minor; spiritual; qualitative; receptive; synthetic; gestalt; facial recognition; simultaneous comprehension; perception of abstract patterns

===Laws of media===
Another aspect of media ecology is the ''laws of media,'' which McLuhan outlined with his son [[Eric McLuhan]] to further explain the influence of technology on society.&lt;ref name="Laws of media"&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws of media: The new science|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8020-7715-8|location=Toronto|pages=98–99|author2=Eric McLuhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for "the social and physical chaos" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.
[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|thumb|Depiction of Media Tetrad]]
The four effects, as depicted in the [[tetrad of media effects]] are:&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt;
* ''Enhancement'': What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions.
* ''Obsolescence'': What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. 
* ''Retrieval'': What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. 
* ''Reversal'': What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, "pushed to the limit of its potential,"&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt; it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media.

==Criticism==

===Technological determinism===
A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. [[Determinism]] insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language ([[linguistic determinism]]), religion ([[theological determinism]]), financial ([[economic determinism]]). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as [[technological determinism]]. According to Postman, "The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Postman has also stated that "a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Postman|first=Neil|title=The Humanism of Media Ecology|url=http://media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/humanism_of_media_ecology.html|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] view McLuhan and his "Medium is the Message" theory as a prime example of technological determinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion 
that "the medium is the message", the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zimmer, Michael|authorlink=Michael Zimmer (academic)|title=Media Ecology and Value Sensitive Design: A Combined Approach to Understanding the Biases of Media Technology|conference=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=6|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world "by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important."&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fekete, John|title=McLuhanacy: Counterrevolution in cultural theory|journal=Telos|year=1973|volume=1973|issue=15|pp=75–123|doi=10.3817/0373015075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lance Strate]], on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. "McLuhan never actually used the term, "determinism," nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, ''The Medium is the Message'', he wrote, "there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening" (McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, "we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Culkin, J.|year=1967|chapter=Each culture develops its own sense ratio to meet the demands of its environment|editor=G. Stearn|title=McLuhan: Hot and cool|pp=49–57|location=New York: New American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a transactional approach to media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strate, Lance|title=Studying media as media: McLuhan and the media ecology approach|journal=MediaTropes|volume=1|issue=1|year=2008|p=133|url=http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/3344/1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as "[[soft determinism]]" opposed to "[[hard determinism]]" with the difference being that "hard determinism" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas "soft determinism" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.

While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are "inherently moral agents" and their development is a "moral enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cussing the buzz-saw, or, the medium is the morality of Peter-Paul Verbeek|date=2016|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1386/eme.15.2.129_1|author=Grosswiler, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Technological Artefacts Be Moral Agents?|date=2011|publisher=|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=411–424|doi=10.1007/s11948-010-9241-3|pmid=20927601|pmc=3183318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter-Paul Verbeek|title=Obstetric Ultrasound and the Technological Mediation of Morality: A Postphenomenological Analysis|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Human Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–26|doi=10.1007/s10746-007-9079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disruptions to existing systems ===
While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.waccglobal.org/articles/a-shifting-media-ecology-what-the-age-of-luther-can-teach-us|title=A shifting media ecology: What the age of Luther can teach us|journal=Media Development|date=2017|volume=64|issue=2|pp=5–10|author=Soukup, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# New Technologies
# New Audiences
# New Authority
#New Rhetoric

One example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include "any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A media ecological analysis of do-it-yourself education: Exploring relationships between the symbolic and the material realms of human action|author=John Dowd|doi=10.1386/eme.13.2.155_1|date=June 2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|number=2|pp=155–175(21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.

==== Mobility and Modality ====
Various scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et. al create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize Media Ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of ‘mediated mobilities’ to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a ''modal medium theory''. She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states Media Ecology Theory is “grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hildebrand|first=Julia M|date=2017-05-11|title=Modal media: connecting media ecology and mobilities research|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443717707343|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=348–364|doi=10.1177/0163443717707343|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hildebrand explains that Strate’s concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, “[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Much like Media Ecology, mobilities research talk about a “flow” that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this statement by creating a term that describes the intersection of communication environments (“contact zones”) and issues of mobility- ''interstices.''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimmick|first=John|last2=Feaster|first2=John Christian|last3=Hoplamazian|first3=Gregory J.|date=2010-05-18|title=News in the interstices: The niches of mobile media in space and time|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444810363452|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1177/1461444810363452|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of “nonspace” or “nonplace” considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===The medium is not the message===
McLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really "the medium is the message" is a metaphor not an equation.  His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an "extension of man" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.&lt;ref name=Grosswiler&gt;{{cite book|last=Grosswiler|first=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=p.52|isbn=9781433110672|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of McLuhan's high profile critics was [[Umberto Eco]]. Eco comes from background in [[semiotics]], which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary.  Believing this to be true Eco says, "It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it." In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=W. Terrance|title=McLuhan: A Guide for the Perplexed|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|location=London, GBR|isbn=9781441143808|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"/&gt; and Neil Compton as meaningless or "McLuhanacy". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, "it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Raymond|title=McLuhan: Pro and Con|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Jonathan Miller]] claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a "probe" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|title=Marshall McLuhan|year=1971|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0670019120|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as [[Raymond Rosenthal]], also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims:&lt;ref name='Strate'/&gt; "McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; Additionally, As [[Lance Strate]] said: "Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a "Great Divide" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.

==Research ==

===New media===
Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current [[new media]] has a "new" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of [[web 2.0]]. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, [[Tim O'Reilly]]. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=What Is Web 2.0? Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/09/what-is-web-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a [[participatory culture]] which proves Neil Postman's saying "[[Wikiversity:Neil Postman: Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change|technological change]] is not additive; it is ecological".

As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which "portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation".&lt;ref name=Milberry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milberry|first=K|author2=Anderson, S.|title=Open Sourcing Our Way to an Online Commons: Contesting Corporate Impermeability in the New Media Ecology|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2009|pages=393–412|volume=33|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0196859909340349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers.&lt;ref name=Milberry/&gt; So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.

There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and [[media literacy]] in its youth.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumpert|first=Gary|author2=Robert Cathcart|title=Media grammars, generations, and media gaps|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|year=1985|volume=2|pages=23–35|doi=10.1080/15295038509360059}}&lt;/ref&gt; As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"/&gt; The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.

According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is "the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntley|first=Rebecca|title=The World According to Y: Inside the New Adult Generation|year=2006|publisher=Crows Nest NSW|location=Australia|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, "there may actually be no unified ethos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Serazio|first=Michael|title=(New) Media Ecology and Generation Mash-Up Identity: The Technological Bias of Millennial Youth Culture|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/8/6/6/p238668_index.html|conference= NCA 94th Annual Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With "hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Screenagers: Lessons In Chaos From Digital Kids|year=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1572736245|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled "How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D'Arcy, C. J.|author2=Eastburn, D. M.|author3=Bruce, B. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs|journal=College Teaching|volume=57|issue=1|pp=56–63|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/274764053|doi=10.3200/CTCH.57.1.56-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested "new media" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing "hot" and "cold" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most "valued" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.

==Application and Case Studies ==
There is significant research being done on the rise of [[social media]] platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: 

=== Social media activism ===
While many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correa|first=Teresa|last2=Hinsley|first2=Amber Willard|last3=de Zúñiga|first3=Homero Gil|date=2010-03-01|title=Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users' personality and social media use|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. [[Social media activism]] and [[hashtag activism]] have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests.

Thomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit|Toronto G20 Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poell|first=Thomas|year=2014|title=Social media and the transformation of activist communication: exploring the social media ecology of the 2010 Toronto G20 protests|url=|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=716–731|via=|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2013.812674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Flickr|Flikr]], Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time.

Additionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tags]] to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crandall|first=Heather|last2=Cunningham|first2=Carolyn M.|year=2016|title=Media ecology and hashtag activism: #Kaleidoscope|url=|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=22–32|doi=10.1386/eme.15.1.21_1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice.

=== Case Studies ===

==== [[Arab Spring]]: Egypt and Iran ====
Doctor Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970's Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title "Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution"&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Mark Allen. "Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution." Arab media &amp; society 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the "[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the "[[mediascape]]" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt.

Peterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after"&lt;ref name=Beeman&gt;Beeman, William O. "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after." The news media and national and international conflict (1984): 147-165.&lt;/ref&gt; on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the [[Iranian Revolution]] followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: "At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted."&lt;ref name=Beeman/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Although there were many similarities between the Iranian and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutions]], such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}} The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support for the people of Egypt. (Bowman 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Warigia. 2011. Dictators and the Internet. Cairo Review of Global Affairs. http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/CairoReview/Pages/articleDetails.aspx?aid=34 [accessed November 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|4}} According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==== [[Gezi Park protests|Gezi Protests]]: Turkey  ====
Much like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term “Turkish media ecology” to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey’s relationship with media outlets and platforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc|title=Conspiratorial Webs: Media Ecology and Parallel Realities in Turkey|last=Hoyng|first=Rolien|last2=Es|first2=Murat|date=2016|website=International Journal of Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how “…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They also note that such censored media ecology forms a ‘fertile milieu’ for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haciyakupoglu|first=Gulizar|last2=Zhang|first2=Weiyu|date=2015-03-18|title=Social Media and Trust during the Gezi Protests in Turkey|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/4/450/4067584|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=450–466|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12121|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that “closed groups” like Whatsapp and Facebook “…allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends” whereas Twitter was used for “rapid acquisition of logistic information” that became important during the protest.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

====[[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15M Movement]]: Spain  ====
Emiliano Treré looks to the Media Ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain’s 15M movement. Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus “…because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treré|first=Emiliano|last2=Mattoni|first2=Alice|date=2015-11-25|title=Media ecologies and protest movements: main perspectives and key lessons|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1109699|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=290–306|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109699|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain’s anti-austerity movement, also called the “15M movement.” Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias “various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postill|first=John|date=2013-10-23|title=Democracy in an age of viral reality: A media epidemiography of Spain’s indignados movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138113502513|journal=Ethnography|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1177/1466138113502513|issn=1466-1381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of “technological sovereignty” among activists.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Media Ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where “viral” posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The '''medieval popular Bible''' is a term used especially in literary studies, but also in art history and other disciplines, to encompass the wide variety of presentations of [[Bible|biblical material]] in medieval culture not directly recorded in the [[exegesis|exegetical tradition]].

The "exegetical tradition" means the vast corpus of Latin writings, often [[List of Bible commentaries|biblical commentaries]], [[sermon]]s or preaching handbooks, diatribes against doctrinal deviancy and philosophical explorations, in which scholars of the medieval [[Christian Church|Church]] present the Bible according to medieval orthodoxy. Its intended readership is, in the first instance, other theologians.

In contrast to this, the "medieval popular Bible" is aimed at the ordinary population of medieval Europe, and to some extent is also created by them. It ranges from very pious vernacular writings such as the Biblical Epic to scurrillous [[fabliau]]x in which biblical figures make an appearance. It includes most [[Liturgical drama|religious drama]], much [[stained glass]] and some wild and fanciful retellings of [[Bible story|Bible stories]].   

The [[forbidden fruit]] is a standard example. The [[Bible]] itself does not say what kind of fruit it was, but in the popular retelling, as opposed to the theological schools, it became an [[apple]].  Since the apple served well to communicate spiritual ideas, the exegetical tradition did not resist it. In the medieval understanding of biblical truth, there was no need for a modern style of debate on the accuracy of the motif.

Serious work on this area of [[medieval culture]] probably began with [[Beryl Smalley]] in the 1940s. The term "medieval popular Bible" became established in scholarship relatively recently as a result of the writings of [[Brian O. Murdoch]], though the phrase had been used before him, usually in a less clearly defined way.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Spencer,  "Review of Brian Murdoch. The Medieval Popular Bible: Expansions of Genesis in the Middle Ages," ''Review of English Studies'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3212">'''Māori science''' also called '''Te Pūtaiao Māori''' (literally ''Māori knowledge of the natural world''), is an [[academic discipline]] at the intersection of [[Western science]] and [[mātauranga Māori]] (literally ''Māori knowledge'' or [[traditional knowledge]] of the [[Māori people]]). It can be viewed as a [[decolonization]] of [[science]]. Maori science is practiced by the Māori people; the natives of New Zealand. As a result of separation from the other nations, the Maori developed their own culture and practices.
Largely a product of [[Māori Renaissance]] of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, most Māori science is project-based with science-based organisation partner with [[iwi]] organisations and typically government funding. Outputs typically include traditional scientific outputs (i.e. articles in peer reviewed journals) as well as concrete benefits for [[iwi]]. Examples include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1518">The '''National Committee for the History of Art''' (NCHA) is the U.S. affiliate of the [[Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art]] (CIHA, i.e. the international community of art historians). It was founded in 1980 by [[Irving Lavin]]. 

Both committees aim to foster intellectual exchange among scholars and students interested in all fields of art history. They organize scholarly conferences and promote the communication, dissemination and exchange of knowledge and information about art history in order to promote a global community of art historians. 

The NCHA is supported by the [[Getty Foundation]] and interested in developing global networks of art historians, particularly in areas of the world in which art history is an emerging discipline. Therefore, it brings together art historians from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe for discussions on the state of the discipline. The NCHA also provides travel support to congresses for students enrolled in US doctoral programs.

The current president of the NCHA is [[Marc Gotlieb]], Director of the Graduate Program and Class of 1955 Memorial Professor of Art at [[Williams College]], [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]].

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

The '''nature study''' movement (alternatively, '''Nature Study''' or '''nature-study''') was a popular education movement in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Nature study attempted to reconcile scientific investigation with spiritual, personal experiences gained from interaction with the natural world.  Led by [[progressive education|progressive]] educators and naturalists such as [[Anna Botsford Comstock]], [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Wilbur S. Jackman]], nature study changed the way science was taught in schools by emphasizing learning from tangible objects, something that was embodied by the movement's mantra "study nature, not books".

The movement popularized scientific study outside of the classroom as well, and has proven highly influential for figures involved in the modern environmental movement, such as [[Aldo Leopold]] and [[Rachel Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the mid-19th century, a growing concern for the state of the environment began to take shape.  In 1864, American diplomat [[George Perkins Marsh]] published the groundbreaking book ''[[Man and Nature]]''.  Highlighting people's responsibility to the natural world, the work marked the beginning of the conservation movement.&lt;ref&gt;Krech, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1890s, the idea of nature study existed, but the "efforts had been sporadic and piecemeal".&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 327"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturalist Louis Agassiz wanted to capture "learners in studying the natural world".  His students, who were influenced by this philosophy, went on to provide the nature study knowledge in public schools.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 325"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;   It was Agassiz who coined the phrase, "Study nature, not books."&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 325"/&gt;

==Definitions==
Nature study can be described as "conceiving of the movement as a loose coalition of communities composed of individuals, societies, and institutions able to find some common ground in the study and appreciation of the natural world".&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 128"&gt;Tolley, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  In "Leaflet I: What Is Nature-Study?" from a 1904 collection nature study lessons, [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] presented the following description of nature study:

&lt;blockquote&gt;NATURE-STUDY, as a process, is seeing the things that one looks at, and the drawing of proper conclusions from what one sees.  Its purpose is to educate the child in terms of his environment, to the end that his life may be fuller and richer.  Nature-study is not the study of a science, as of botany, entomology, geology, and the like.  That is, it takes the things at hand and endeavors to understand them, without reference primarily to the systematic order or relationships of objects.  It is informal, as are the objects which one sees.  It is entirely divorced from mere definitions, or from formal explanations in books.  It is therefore supremely natural.  It trains the eye and the mind to see and to comprehend the common things of life; and the result is not directly the acquiring of science but the establishing of a living sympathy with everything that is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anna Comstock defined the idea extensively in her book, ''Handbook of Nature Study'':  "Nature Study is for the comprehension of the Individual life of the bird, insect or plant that is nearest at hand."&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 5"&gt;Comstock, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Comstock continued that nature study aided "both discernment and in expression of things as they are".&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 1"&gt;Comstock, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement came at a time when society was concerned with the future of the next generation&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", pp. ?-?&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[conservation movement|nature conservation]] itself,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Tolley, pp. ?-?&lt;/ref&gt; and because of this was met with high regard and high expectations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Though many efforts had come before 1890 by some naturalist and scientists to teach and expand the movement, the nature-study movement really did not gain momentum with the public until the late 19th century, early 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The Nature Study changed the curriculum for children in many of areas of the country,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and it also affected the way young and teenage girls were able to learn and find job placement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The movement was often related to creating a less extensive or formal science training for females. {{citation needed|reason=claim not substantiated by previous text|date=July 2015}}

=="Study nature, not books"==
Many scientists, teachers, and leaders throughout the United States agreed on the value of nature study, and the subject became an important part of how the natural world was examined in many areas of the country by the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists gave public support to the philosophy and added to the creation of a curriculum and courses.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 327"/&gt;  The movement was particularly popular in the Northeast, the West, and the Midwest.  The South also found some use for the idea of natural science in their agriculture schools, as well as at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama (now [[Tuskegee University]]) and Hampton Institute in Virginia (now [[Hampton University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature Study could be found in both urbanized, highly populated cities and in rural school systems because of the involvement of scientists in designing and implementing curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Wilbur Jackman created an outline of nature study with "life and its phenomena" which examined how the study of plants and animals would consist of zoology and botany (under biology), physics, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, geography, geology, and mineralogy.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucretia Crocker]] along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a "[[Teachers' School of Science]]" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society.   Along with a [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers.   Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Nature Study Society was founded in 1908, and still exists today.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"&gt;Tolley, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  The society was an important aspect as well in helping to bring about the Nature-Study movement. [[Anna Botsford Comstock]] is one of the society' past presidents.  It is considered to be America's oldest organization for environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirolink.org/resource.html?catid=5&amp;itemid=84 The American Nature Study Society]. EnviroLink Network. Retrieved on June 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Botsford Comstock]] studied and worked as the head of the Department of Nature Study at Cornell University with her husband, [[John Henry Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrick and Smith, caption of p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Cornell University was considered to be a major hub for the Nature Study movement.   She wrote the ''Handbook of Nature Study'', which includes sections on how to teach the subject and how to teach the courses to children, and also includes sections from different species of animals and plants to even the skies.

==Education for children==
Sciences were expanding in colleges and universities, and scientists felt "that students needed more and better preparation in secondary and primary schools".&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 329"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only was the curriculum of schools evolving, but also was the system of education itself.  Populations were rising in big urban areas like New York and Chicago, and there was legislation to require students to spend required numbers of hours and days per year in the school system.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 329"/&gt;  With a growing population due to immigration and other reasons, young people could be taught useful skills for life and academia in order to "share fundamental civic values and enlarged view of their world".&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature study became the way younger students learned of their natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;  This also came at a time when legislation was being passed for conservation in the country, which helped gather support from parents and educators in the country.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"/&gt;

Anna Botsford Comstock, stated in her book ''Handbook of Nature Study'', "nature-study cultivates the child's imagination, since there are so many wonderful and true stories that he may read with his own eyes, which affect his imagination as much as does fairy lore, at the same time nature study cultivates in him a perception and a regard for what is true, and the power to express it...Nature study gives the child practical and helpful knowledge.  It makes him familiar with nature's ways and forces, so that he is not so helpless in the presence of natural misfortune and disasters."&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 1"/&gt;  Comstock also felt that the nature study did not begin with books, but through the observations of life and form from the first naturalists.&lt;ref&gt;Comstock, p. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;  The point of the system being to "give pupils an outlook over all the forms of life and their relation one to another".&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 5"/&gt;

Because of the importance placed on the new generation, the surrounding public watched the schools carefully with high expectations of the students in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in Kim Tolley's the ''Science Education of American Girls'' showed that of 127 public school systems, 49% offered Nature-study in all grades, 25% offered in at least six grades, 11% in at least four grades, 5% in three grades or lower, and 10% did not offer it at all in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in the movement==
Women played many roles in this movement within American society.  Some were able to find supervisory jobs, or jobs as professor in natural history at school districts, or institutions of higher learning.  Some women helped to create the movement itself, like Anna Botsford Comstock, and also teachers were able to "[implement] nature study to varying degrees in their classrooms and occasionally modified the curriculum created by male professionals so that it favored the life sciences".&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"/&gt;

Over the four years from 1915–16 to 1919–20 in the state of  [[Wisconsin]], the percentage of women high school biology teachers increased from 50% to 67%.  The number of women physics teachers increased from 3% in 1915–16 to 7% in 1919–20.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature study movement gave a new outlook to the [[education of young women]] in the United States. In the later 20th century, opinions started to change about the movement, and it declined.  Some male critics saw it as "romantic" or "sentimental".  This created a gender issue that was forcibly imposed on the nature-study movement.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 128"/&gt;  By the beginning of the 20th century, many young women were attracted to the natural history movement.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The Science Education of American Girls by Kim Tolley gives an explanation of high schools in America for females.  "Higher schools for females served as important centers for the dissemination of the nineteenth-century ideology of separate spheres, institutions commonly located in small towns and in rural, rather than urban, areas.  The ideology prevailed in antebellum southern institutions serving elite girls who never expected to work for wages outside the home, in northern schools that explicitly south to prepare teachers for the nation's growing common schools, and in Catholic academies on the western front."&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as [[Susanna Moodie]], and her daughter [[Agnes_Dunbar_Moodie_Fitzgibbon|Agnes Chamberlin]] who made nature studies to support her family, and Catharine Parr Traill investigated nature to describe the new territories where they found themselves in nineteenth century Canada.&lt;ref&gt;https://fishercollections.library.utoronto.ca/chamberlin_chrono&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Normative''' generally means relating to an evaluative standard. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good or desirable or permissible and others as bad or undesirable or impermissible. A norm in this normative sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. Normative is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in this field try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grammar of Society:The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0521574907|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Norms in the Wild: How to Diagnose, Measure, and Change Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780190622053|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Normative'' has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/227918828|title=Normativity|last=Jarvis.|first=Thomson, Judith|date=2008|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812696585|location=Chicago, Ill.|oclc=227918828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major developments in analytic philosophy has seen the reach of normativity spread to virtually all corners of the field, from ethics and the philosophy of action, to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. Saul Kripke famously showed that rules (including mathematical rules, such as the repetition of a decimal pattern) are normative in an important respect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862091562|title=Being realistic about reasons|last=Thomas,|first=Scanlon,|isbn=9780199678488|edition= First|location=Oxford|oclc=862091562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7998796|title=Wittgenstein on rules and private language : an elementary exposition|last=1940-|first=Kripke, Saul A.,|date=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674954009|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=7998796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood, it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As Derek Parfit explains:

{{Quote|We can have reasons to believe something, to do something, to have some desire or aim, and to have many other attitudes and emotions, such as fear, regret, and hope. Reasons are given by facts, such as the fact that someone's finger-prints are on some gun, or that calling an ambulance would save someone's life. It is hard to explain the ''concept'' of a reason, or what the phrase 'a reason' means. Facts give us reasons, we might say, when they count in favour of our having some attitude, or our acting in some way. But 'counts in favour of' means roughly 'gives a reason for'. The concept of a reason is best explained by example. One example is the thought that we always have a reason to want to avoid being in agony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/744616054|title=On what matters Volume one|last=Derek.|first=Parfit,|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scheffler, Samuel, 1951-|isbn=9780191576706|location=Oxford|oclc=744616054}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Ethics}}
In [[philosophy]], ''normative'' statements make claims about how things should or [[Is-ought problem|ought]] to be, how to [[Value theory|value]] them, which things are [[goodness and value theory|good]] or bad, and which [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s are [[right]] or [[wrong]].  Normative claims are usually contrasted with [[Positive statement|positive]] (i.e. descriptive, [[explanation|explanatory]], or [[constative]]) claims when describing types of [[theory|theories]], [[belief]]s, or [[proposition]]s. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual statements that attempt to describe [[reality]].

For example, "children should eat vegetables", and "those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither" are normative claims. On the other hand, "vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins", and "a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both" are positive claims. Whether a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.

There are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be [[reason|rationally]] discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of [[practical reason]] extending from [[Aristotle]] through [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], which asserts that they can, and the tradition of [[emotivism]], which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content. &lt;!--last sentence/statement: i.e., objectivity vs. subjectivity(?)--&gt;

Normative statements and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. [[Thought]], [[belief]], [[emotion]], and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).

Much modern moral/ethical philosophy takes as its starting point the apparent variance between peoples and cultures regarding the ways they define what is considered to be appropriate/desirable/praiseworthy/valuable/good etc. (In other words, variance in how individuals, groups and societies define what is in accordance with their normative standards.) This has led philosophers such as [[A.J. Ayer]] and [[J.L. Mackie]] (for different reasons and in different ways) to cast doubt on the meaningfulness of normative statements. However, other philosophers, such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], have argued for a source of normative value which is independent of individuals' subjective morality and which consequently attains (a lesser or greater degree of) objectivity.

== Social sciences and economics ==
In the [[social sciences]], the term "normative" has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a [[sociological]] context, to the role of cultural '[[norm (social)|norms]]'; the shared values or institutions that [[structural functionalist]]s regard as constitutive of the [[social structure]] and [[social cohesion]]. These values and units of [[socialization]] thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that ''ought'' to (with respect to the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that ''ought not'' occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially ''valued'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as "[[crime]]" or anti-social behaviour, see also [[normality (behavior)]]) the normative effects of popularly endorsed beliefs (such as "[[family values]]" or "[[common sense]]") push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological [[conservatism]].

[[Normative economics]] deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, valued) economic outcomes.

== International relations ==
In the academic discipline of [[International relations]], Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens in the ''Introduction'' to their 2008 &lt;ref&gt;''The Globalization of World Politics: An introduction to international relations'', New York, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199297771}}, Fourth edition, pp.2-13&lt;/ref&gt; book make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of [[Tacit assumption|implicit assumption]]s and [[explicit assumption]]s that constitute a non-normative position, and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[Liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations)|Constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], political [[Idealism]] and political [[Globalization]].

== Law ==
{{See also|Normative jurisprudence}}
In [[law]], as an academic discipline, the term "normative" is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.

== Standards documents ==
Normative elements are defined in [[International Organization for Standardization]] Directives Part 2 as "elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions".  Provisions include "requirements", "recommendations" and "statements".  "Statements" include permissions, possibilities and capabilities.  A "requirement" is an "expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted."  It is not necessary to comply with recommendations and statements in order to comply with the standard; it is necessary to comply only with the requirements (that are denoted by the verbal form "shall").  There is much confusion between "normative" and "requirement", however the ISO terminology is supported by national standards bodies worldwide and is the legitimate description of these terms in the context of standards documents.

In [[Standardization|standard]]s terminology still used by some organisations, "normative" means "considered to be a [[wikt:prescriptive|prescriptive]] part of the standard". It characterises that part of the standard which describes what ''ought'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above) to be done within the application of that standard. It is implicit that application of that standard will result in a ''valuable'' outcome (''ibid.''). For example, many standards have an introduction, preface, or summary that is considered non-normative, as well as a main body that is considered normative. "Compliance" is defined as "complies with the normative sections of the standard"; an object that complies with the normative sections but not the non-normative sections of a standard is still considered to be in compliance.

* Normative = prescriptive = how to comply
* Informative = descriptive = help with conceptual understanding

Typically, ''normative'' is contrasted with ''informative'' (referring to the standard's descriptive, explanatory or [[Positive science|positive]] content).  Informative data is supplemental information such as additional guidance, supplemental recommendations, tutorials, commentary as well as background, history, development, and relationship with other elements.  Informative data is not a requirement and doesn’t compel compliance.

[[ File:Giorgione - Sleeping Venus - Google Art Project 2.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Giorgione's ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'' (c. 1510), Dresden, [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].]]
In [[art history]], "'''Old Master'''" (or "'''old master'''")&lt;ref&gt;The term is spelled either way in the literature. Major UK and US dictionaries, incl. the [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/old_master Oxford Online Dictionaries], [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=old%20master American Heritage Dictionary], Macmillan, Cambridge, and Random House dictionaries use lowercase; Oxford English Dictionary, Collins, and Merriam-Webster dictionaries also mention the uppercase spelling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christies1&gt;[http://www.christies.com/departments/old-master-and-early-british-paintings-70-1.aspx Old Masters Department], Christies.com.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to any [[painting|painter]] of skill who worked in Europe before about 1800, or a painting by such an artist. An "[[old master print]]" is an original [[printmaking|print]] (for example an [[engraving]] or [[etching]]) made by an artist in the same period. The term "old master [[drawing]]" is used in the same way.

In theory, "Old Master" applies only to artists who were fully trained, were [[Master craftsman|Master]]s of their local [[Guild of Saint Luke|artists' guild]], and worked independently, but in practice, paintings produced by pupils or workshops are often included in the scope of the term. Therefore, beyond a certain level of competence, date rather than quality is the criterion for using the term.

==Period covered==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term was often understood as having a starting date of perhaps 1450 or 1470; paintings made before that were "primitives", but this distinction is no longer made. The  ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''  defines the term as "A pre-eminent artist of the period before the modern; esp. a pre-eminent western European painter of the 13th to 18th centuries." The first quotation given is from 1696, in the diary of [[John Evelyn]]: "My L: Pembroke..shewed me divers rare Pictures of very many of the old &amp; best Masters, especially that of M: Angelo..,&amp; a large booke of the best drawings of the old Masters."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"old master, n. and adj." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to a painting or sculpture made by an Old Master, a usage datable to 1824.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; There are comparable terms in Dutch, French and German; the Dutch may have been the first to make use of such a term, in the 18th century, when ''oude meester'' mostly meant [[Dutch Golden Age painting|painters of the Dutch Golden Age]] of the previous century. ''Les Maitres d'autrefois'' of 1876 by [[Eugene Fromentin]] may have helped to popularize the concept, although "vieux maitres" is also used in French. The famous collection in [[Dresden]] at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] is one of the few museums to include the term in its actual name, although many more use it in the title of departments or sections. The collection in the Dresden museum essentially stops at the [[Baroque]] period.

The end date is necessarily vague – for example, [[Goya]] (1746–1828) is certainly an Old Master,&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; though he was still painting and [[printmaking]] at his death in 1828. The term might also be used for [[John Constable]]&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; (1776–1837) or [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1868), but usually is not.

The term tends to be avoided by [[art historian]]s as too vague, especially when discussing paintings, although the terms "Old Master Prints" and "Old Master drawings" are still used. It remains current in the art trade. Auction houses still usually divide their sales between, for example, "Old Master Paintings", "Nineteenth-century paintings" and "Modern paintings". [[Christie's]] defines the term as ranging "from the 14th to the early 19th century".{{cite quote|date=January 2017}}

==Anonymous artists==
Artists, most often from early periods, whose hand has been identified by art historians, but to whom no identity can be confidently attached, are often given names by art historians such as ''[[Master E.S.]]'' (from his monogram), ''[[Master of Flémalle]]'' (from a previous location of a work), ''Master of [[Mary of Burgundy]]'' (from a patron), ''[[Master of Latin 757]]'' (from the shelf mark of a manuscript he illuminated), ''[[Master of the Brunswick Diptych]]'' or ''[[Master of Schloss Lichtenstein]]''.

[[File:Parchment from goatskin.jpg|right|thumb|Central European (Northern) type of finished parchment made of [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]] stretched on a wooden frame]]
[[File:קלף, נוצה ודיו.jpg|thumb|Parchment with a quill and ink]]
'''Parchment''' is a writing material made from specially prepared untanned skins of animals—primarily sheep, calves, and goats. It has been used as a writing medium for over two millennia. [[Vellum]] is a finer quality parchment made from the skins of young animals such as lambs and young calves.

It may be called '''animal membrane''' by libraries and museums that wish to avoid distinguishing between "parchment" and the more restricted term vellum (see below).

== Parchment and vellum ==
Today the term "parchment" is often used in non-technical contexts to refer to any animal skin, particularly [[goat]], [[sheep]] or [[cow]], that has been scraped or dried under tension. The term originally referred only to the skin of sheep and, occasionally, goats. The equivalent material made from calfskin, which was of finer quality, was known as [[vellum]] (from the [[Old French]] ''velin'' or ''vellin'', and ultimately from the [[Latin]] ''vitulus'', meaning a calf);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Roy|title=Conservation of Leather and Related Materials |year=2007 |publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-7506-4881-3|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the finest of all was "uterine vellum", taken from a calf [[foetus]] or [[stillbirth|stillborn]] calf.

Some authorities have sought to observe these distinctions strictly: for example, [[lexicographer]] [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1755, and master [[calligrapher]] [[Edward Johnston]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Johnston |authorlink=Edward Johnston |year=1906 |title=Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering |place=London |publisher=John Hogg }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when old books and documents are encountered it may be difficult, without scientific analysis, to determine the precise animal origin of a skin either in terms of its species, or in terms of the animal's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Cains |chapter=The surface examination of skin: a binder's note on the identification of animal species used in the making of parchment |title=The Book of Kells: proceedings of a conference at Trinity College Dublin, 6–9 September 1992 |editor-first=Felicity |editor-last=O'Mahony |publisher=Scolar Press |place=Aldershot |year=1994 |isbn=0-85967-967-5 |pages=172–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, therefore, there has long been considerable blurring of the boundaries between the different terms. In 1519, [[William Horman]] wrote in his ''Vulgaria'': "That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan."&lt;ref&gt;William Horman, ''Vulgaria'' (1519), fol. 80v; cited in Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (written c. 1599–1602) the following exchange occurs:
{{quote|''Hamlet.'' Is not parchment made of sheepskins?&lt;br /&gt;
''Horatio.'' Ay, my lord, and of calves' skins too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Shakecite|Ham|M|5|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lee Ustick, writing in 1936, commented that:
{{quote|To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that ''vellum'' is a highly refined form of skin, ''parchment'' a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.&lt;ref&gt;Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is for these reasons that many modern [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[librarian]]s and [[archivist]]s prefer to use either the broader term "parchment", or the neutral term "animal membrane".&lt;ref&gt;Stokes and Almagno 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word parchment evolved (via the Latin ''pergamenum'' and the French ''parchemin'') from the name of the city of [[Pergamon]] which was a thriving center of parchment production during the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443382/parchment |title=parchment (writing material) |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |year=2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705155624/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443382/parchment |archive-date=2012-07-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city so dominated the trade that a legend later arose which said that parchment had been invented in Pergamon to replace the use of [[papyrus]] which had become monopolized by the rival city of [[Alexandria]]. This account, originating in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', Book XII, 69–70), is dubious because parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Peter |title=Alexander to Actium: the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age |place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1990 |isbn=0520056116 |page=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentions writing on skins as common in his time, the 5th century BC; and in his ''Histories'' (v.58) he states that the Ionians of Asia Minor had been accustomed to give the name of ''skins'' (''diphtherai'') to books; this word was adapted by Hellenized Jews to describe scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/parchmen.html |title=Parchment |author=Meir Bar-Ilan |website=Bar-Ilan University – Faculty Members Homepages |access-date=2005-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050422080330/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/parchmen.html |archive-date=2005-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century BC, [[Library of Pergamum|a great library]] was set up in Pergamon that rivaled the famous [[Library of Alexandria]]. As prices rose for papyrus and the reed used for making it was over-harvested towards local extinction in the two [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] of the [[Nile delta]] that produced it, Pergamon adapted by increasing use of parchment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/blog/post/the-history-of-vellum-and-parchment|title=The History Of Vellum And Parchment {{!}} The New Antiquarian {{!}} The Blog of The Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America|last=|first=|date=|website=www.abaa.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830081534/https://www.abaa.org/Blog/post/the-history-of-vellum-and-parchment|archive-date=30 August 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Writing on prepared animal skins had a long history, however. [[David Diringer]] noted that "the first mention of Egyptian documents written on leather goes back to the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2550–2450 BC), but the earliest of such documents extant are: a fragmentary roll of leather of the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 24th century BC), unrolled by Dr. H. Ibscher, and preserved in the [[Cairo Museum]]; a roll of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] (c. 1990–1777 BC) now in Berlin; the mathematical text now in the [[British Museum]] (MS. 10250); and a document of the reign of [[Ramses II]] (early thirteenth century BC)."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Diringer]], ''The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Assyria]]ns and the [[Babylonians]] impressed their [[cuneiform]] on clay tablets, they also wrote on parchment from the 6th century BC onward. [[Rabbinic literature]] traditionally maintains that the institution of employing parchment made of animal hides for the writing of ritual objects such as the [[Torah]], [[mezuzah]], and [[tefillin]] is [[Revelation at Sinai|Sinaitic]] in origin, with special designations for different types of parchment such as [[gevil]] and [[klaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillin 1:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic texts are also found on parchment.

In the later [[Middle Ages]], especially the 15th century, parchment was largely replaced by [[paper]] for most uses except luxury manuscripts, some of which were also on paper. New techniques in paper milling allowed it to be much cheaper than parchment; it was made of textile rags and of very high quality. With the advent of [[printing]] in the later fifteenth century, the demands of printers far exceeded the supply of animal skins for parchment.

[[File:NLW Penrice and Margam Deeds 204 front (8634702372).jpg|thumb|left|Latin [[Grant (money)|grant]] written on fine parchment or [[vellum]] with [[seal (device)|seal]] dated 1329]]

There was a short period during the introduction of printing where parchment and paper were used at the same time, with parchment (in fact vellum) the more expensive luxury option, preferred by rich and conservative customers. Although most copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] are on paper, some were printed on parchment; 12 of the 48 surviving copies, with most incomplete. In 1490, [[Johannes Trithemius]] preferred the older methods, because "handwriting placed on parchment will be able to endure a thousand years. But how long will printing last, which is dependent on paper? For if ... it lasts for two hundred years that is a long time."&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in David McKitterick, ''Print, Manuscript, and the Search for Order'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In fact high quality paper from this period has survived 500 years or more very well, if kept in reasonable library conditions.

The heyday of parchment use was during the medieval period, but there has been a growing revival of its use among artists since the late 20th century. Although parchment never stopped being used (primarily for governmental documents and diplomas) it had ceased to be a primary choice for artist's supports by the end of 15th century [[Renaissance]]. This was partly due to its expense and partly due to its unusual working properties. Parchment consists mostly of [[collagen]]. When the water in paint media touches parchment's surface, the collagen melts slightly, forming a raised bed for the paint, a quality highly prized by some artists.

Parchment is also extremely affected by its environment and changes in humidity, which can cause buckling. Books with parchment pages were bound with strong wooden boards and clamped tightly shut by metal (often brass) clasps or leather straps;&lt;ref name="pul" /&gt; this acted to keep the pages pressed flat despite humidity changes. Such metal fittings continued to be found on books as decorative features even after the use of paper made them unnecessary.&lt;ref name="pul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/closures/index.html |title=Clasps, Furniture, and Other Closures |author= |year=2004 |work=Hand Bookindings |publisher=Princeton University Library |accessdate=4 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208042037/http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/closures/index.html |archive-date=2011-12-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary artists prize the changeability of parchment, noting that the material seems alive and like an active participant in making artwork. To support the needs of the revival of use by artists, a revival in the art of preparing individual skins is also underway. Hand-prepared skins are usually preferred by artists because they are more uniform in surface and have fewer oily spots which can cause long-term cracking of paint than mass-produced parchment, which is usually made for lamp shades, furniture, or other interior design purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of current artists using parchment see:

The [[radiocarbon dating]] techniques that are used on papyrus can be applied to parchment as well. They do not date the age of the writing but the preparation of the parchment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=F.J.|last2=Gomez-Martinez|first2=I.|last3=Garcia-Leon|first3=M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of medieval manuscripts from the University of Seville|url=http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/75115/4/Radiocarbon%20dating.pdf|format=PDF|website=[[Digital.csic.es]]|access-date=2015-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102317/http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/75115/4/Radiocarbon%20dating.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is feasibly possible also to radio carbon date certain kinds of ink, it is extremely difficult to do due to the fact that they are generally present on the text only in trace amounts, and it is hard to get a carbon sample of them without the carbon in the parchment contaminating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stolte|first=D.|year=2011|title=UA experts determine age of book 'nobody can read'|url=http://uanews.org/story/ua-experts-determine-age-book-nobody-can-read|website=www.uanews.org|access-date=2015-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404164910/http://uanews.org/story/ua-experts-determine-age-book-nobody-can-read|archive-date=2015-04-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
Parchment is prepared from pelt&amp;nbsp;– i.e. wet, unhaired, and limed skin&amp;nbsp;– by drying at ordinary temperatures under tension, most commonly on a wooden frame known as a stretching frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reed |first=Ronald |title=Ancient Skins Parchments and Leathers |year=1972 |publisher=Seminar Press |place=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flaying, soaking, and dehairing ===
After being flayed, the skin is soaked in water for about a day. This removes blood and grime from the skin and prepares it for a dehairing liquor.&lt;ref name='reed75'&gt;Reed, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The dehairing liquor was originally made of rotted, or fermented, vegetable matter, like beer or other liquors, but by the [[Middle Ages]] an unhairing bath included [[lime (mineral)|lime]]. Today, the lime solution is occasionally sharpened by the use of sodium sulfide. The liquor bath would have been in wooden or stone vats and the hides stirred with a long wooden pole to avoid human contact with the [[alkaline]] solution. Sometimes the skins would stay in the unhairing bath for eight or more days depending how concentrated and how warm the solution was kept—unhairing could take up to twice as long in winter. The vat was stirred two or three times a day to ensure the solution's deep and uniform penetration. Replacing the lime water bath also sped the process up. However, if the skins were soaked in the liquor too long, they would be weakened and not able to stand the stretching required for parchment.&lt;ref name='reed75' /&gt;

=== Stretching ===
After soaking in water to make the skins workable, the skins were placed on a stretching frame. A simple frame with nails would work well in stretching the pelts. The skins could be attached by wrapping small, smooth rocks in the skins with rope or leather strips. Both sides would be left open to the air so they could be scraped with a sharp, [[blade#Patterns of knife blades|semi-lunar knife]] to remove the last of the hair and get the skin to the right thickness. The skins, which were made almost entirely of [[collagen]], would form a natural glue while drying and once taken off the frame they would keep their form. The stretching aligned the fibres to be more nearly parallel to the surface.

== Treatments ==
{{See also|Purple parchment}}
To make the parchment more aesthetically pleasing or more suitable for the [[scribe]]s, special treatments were used. According to Reed there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing [[pumice]] powder into the flesh side of parchment while it was still wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run. To make the parchment smooth and white, thin pastes (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.&lt;ref&gt;See for example recipes in the [[Secretum Philosophorum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meliora di Curci in her paper "The History and Technology of Parchment Making" notes that parchment was not always white. "[[Cennino Cennini|Cennini]], a 15th century craftsman provides recipes to tint parchment a variety of colours including purple, indigo, green, red and peach." The Early medieval [[Codex Argenteus]] and [[Codex Vercellensis]], the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] and the [[Codex Brixianus]] give a range of luxuriously produced manuscripts all on [[purple vellum]], in imitation of Byzantine examples, like the [[Rossano Gospels]], [[Sinope Gospels]] and the [[Vienna Genesis]], which at least at one time are believed to have been reserved for Imperial commissions.

Many techniques for [[parchment repair]] exist, to restore creased, torn, or incomplete parchments.

=== Reuse ===
{{Main|Palimpsest}}
During the seventh through the ninth centuries, many earlier parchment manuscripts were scrubbed and scoured to be ready for rewriting, and often the earlier writing can still be read. These recycled parchments are called [[palimpsest]]s. Later, more thorough techniques of scouring the surface irretrievably lost the earlier text.

== Jewish parchment ==
[[File:Torah and jad.jpg|thumb|right|A ''Sefer [[Torah]]'', the traditional form of the [[Hebrew Bible]], is a scroll of parchment.]]
{{See also|Gevil|Klaf|Duchsustus}}
The way in which parchment was processed (from hide to parchment) has undergone a tremendous evolution based on time and location. Parchment and vellum are not the sole methods of preparing animal skins for writing. In the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Bava Batra]] 14B) Moses writes the first Torah Scroll on the unsplit cow-hide called ''[[gevil]]''.

Parchment is still the only medium used by traditional [[religious]] [[Jews]] for [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] or [[tefilin]] and [[mezuzah]]s, and is produced by large companies in [[Israel]]. For those uses, only hides of [[kosher]] animals are permitted. Since there are many requirements for it being fit for the religious use, the liming is usually processed under supervision of a qualified [[Rabbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccdesigninc.com/MishmeresStam/Leaflet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Information Leaflet by Vaad Mishmereth Staam |website=CC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410134250/http://www.ccdesigninc.com/MishmeresStam/Leaflet.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional uses of the term ==
In some universities, the word parchment is still used to refer to the certificate (scroll) presented at graduation ceremonies, even though the modern document is printed on paper or thin card; although doctoral graduates may be given the option of having their scroll written by a calligrapher on vellum. The [[University of Notre Dame]] still uses animal parchment for its [[diploma]]s. Similarly, [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]] use goat skin parchment for their degrees.

=== Plant-based parchment ===
{{See also|Parchment paper (baking)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
'''Vegetable (paper) parchment''' is made by passing a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into [[sulfuric acid]]. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.

Other processes can be used to obtain grease-resistant paper, such as waxing the paper or using [[fluorine]]-based chemicals. Highly beating the fibers gives an even more translucent paper with the same grease resistance. Silicone and other coatings may also be applied to the parchment. A [[silicone]]-coating treatment produces a cross-linked material with high density, stability and heat resistance and low surface tension which imparts good anti-stick or release properties. [[Chromium]] salts can also be used to impart moderate anti-stick properties.

== Parchment craft ==
{{Main|Parchment craft}}
Historians believe that parchment craft originated as an art form in Europe during the fifteenth or sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Parchment craft at that time occurred principally in Catholic communities, where crafts persons created lace-like items such as devotional pictures and communion cards. The craft developed over time, with new techniques and refinements being added. Until the sixteenth century, parchment craft was a European art form. However, missionaries and other settlers relocated to South America, taking parchment craft with them. As before, the craft appeared largely among the Catholic communities. Often, young girls receiving their first communion received gifts of handmade parchment crafts.

Although the invention of the printing press led to a reduced interest in hand made cards and items, by the eighteenth century, people were regaining interest in detailed handwork. Parchment cards became larger in size and crafters began adding wavy borders and perforations. In the nineteenth century, influenced by French romanticism, parchment crafters began adding floral themes and cherubs and hand embossing.

Parchment craft today involves various techniques, including tracing a pattern with white or colored ink, embossing to create a raised effect, stippling, perforating, coloring and cutting. Parchment craft appears in hand made cards, as scrapbook embellishments, as bookmarks, lampshades, decorative small boxes, wall hangings and more.

== DNA testing ==
An article published in 2009 by Timothy L. Stinson considered the possibilities of tracing the origin of medieval parchment manuscripts and codices through [[DNA]] analysis. The methodology would employ [[polymerase chain reaction]] to replicate a small DNA sample to a size sufficiently large for testing. A 2006 study had revealed the genetic signature of several Greek manuscripts to have "goat-related sequences". It might be possible to use these techniques to determine whether related library materials were made from genetically related animals (perhaps from the same herd).&lt;ref&gt;Stinson 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10678">'''Phenomenology''' in architecture can be understood as an aspect of [[philosophy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; researching into the experience of built space, and as shorthand for [[architectural phenomenology]], a historical architectural movement.

==Overview==
The phenomenology of architecture is the philosophical study of architecture as it appears in experience. In contrast, architectural phenomenology is a movement within architecture beginning in the 1950s, reaching its apogee in the late 1970s and 1980s, and continuing until today, which is both intellectual and an aesthetic in character. Architectural phenomenology, with its emphasis on architecture as a human experience that is historically contingent, stood in sharp contrast to the anti-historicism of postwar modernism. As a movement, it helped give new legitimacy to idea that historical buildings contained valuable experiential lessons for contemporary designers. The emphasis on history was a challenge to postwar [[modern architecture]] which eventually led to [[Postmodern architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture’s Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = | pages =  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions  | isbn=9780816666041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
American architects first started seriously studying phenomenology at Princeton University in the 1950s under Prof. [[Jean Labatut]], whose student [[Charles W. Moore]] was the first to write a PhD dissertation, titled Water and Architecture (1958), that drew heavily on the philosophy of [[Gaston Bachelard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture’s Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = | pages =102  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions  | isbn=9780816666041}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Milanese architect [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]], through his influential editorship of the journal Casabella Continuità helped to advance architectural phenomenology in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Otero-Pailos, Theorizing the Anti-Avant-Garde: Invocations of Phenomenology in Architectural Discourse, 1945-1989, (Ph.D. Dissertation: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated with philosopher [[Enzo Paci]], and influenced a generation of young architects including [[Vittorio Gregotti]] and [[Aldo Rossi]].&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio Gregotti and Jorge Otero-Pailos, "Interview with Vittorio Gregotti: The Role of Phenomenology in the Formation of the Italian Neo-Avant-Garde," in Thresholds, n. 21 (Fall 2000), 40-46&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, the Norwegian architect, theorist and historian [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] achieved international acclaim with his book "Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture" (1979), which was markedly influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]]'s hermeneutic ontology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]—''The Psychologizing of Modernity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He also wrote ''Intentions in Architecture'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, Martin Heidegger's essay "Building Dwelling Thinking", 1951&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] was, for many architecture students of the 1980s, an important reference in architectural phenomenology,&lt;ref&gt;A Norwegian, he graduated from the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule ([[ETH]]) in Zurich in 1949 and eventually became Dean of the Oslo School of Architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; especially because the combination of texts and images in his books provided readily accessible explanations for how a phenomenological approach to architecture could be translated into designs. Norberg-Schulz spawned a wide following, including his successor at the Oslo School of Architecture, [[Thomas Thiis-Evensen]].&lt;ref&gt;see Thomas Thiis-Evensen, ''Archetypes in Architecture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the School of Comparative Studies at the [[University of Essex]], under the influence of [[Dalibor Vesely]] and [[Joseph Rykwert]], was the breeding ground for a generation of architectural phenomenologists, which included [[David Leatherbarrow]], professor of architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], professor of architectural history at [[McGill University]], and the architect [[Daniel Libeskind]]. In the 1980s, the phenomenological approach to architecture was continued and further developed by Vesely and his colleague [[Peter Carl]] in their research and teaching at the Department of Architecture at the [[University of Cambridge]]. As architectural phenomenology became established in academia, professors developed theory seminars that tried to expand the movement's range of ideas beyond [[Gaston Bachelard]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Bachelard ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Heidegger]], to include [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Merleau-Ponty's ''Phenomenology of Perception'' (English version 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] [[Hannah Arendt]] and an ever wider group of theorists whose modes of thinking bordered on phenomenology, such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Bergson]], and [[Paul Virilio]] (urban planner).

'''Dwelling'''

The phenomenon of dwelling was a central research theme in architectural phenomenology. Much of the way it was understood in architecture was shaped by the later thought of [[Martin Heidegger]] as set in his influential essay: "Building Dwelling Thinking." He links dwelling to what he refers as the "gathering of the fourfold," namely the regions of being as entailed by the phenomena of: "the saving of earth, the reception of sky (heavens), the initiation of mortals into their death, and the awaiting/remembering of divinities." The essence of dwelling is not architectural, per se, in the same manner that the essence of technology for him is not technological per se.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Nader El-Bizri]], "Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger's Reflections on Dwelling", ''Environment, Space, Place'' Vol. 3 (2011)pp.&amp;nbsp;47–71; and [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' 60 (2015)pp.&amp;nbsp;5–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in practice==
Prominent architects, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]] [[Steven Holl]] and [[Peter Zumthor]] are described by [[Juhani Pallasmaa]] as current practitioners of the phenomenology of architecture. In more recent years the phenomenological orientation in architectural thinking has been reinforced through the research of a new generation of younger architectural phenomenologist, such as the philosopher-architect [[Nader El-Bizri]], who is a Heideggerian scholar with extensive works in phenomenology and commentaries on [[Khôra]], and a metaphysician in his own right, or via the practice of the academic-architect Adam Sharr in Britain.

'''Project Neptune'''  is a water distribution project in the United Kingdom with the goal of establishing an optimized and more sustainable system for water distribution. The project was officially announced in April 2007, and received a budget of £2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-csd.eng.cam.ac.uk/themes0/water-1/project-neptune-delivering-sustainable-water-systems-by-optimising-existing-infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, water service providers (WSPs) are legally obligated to provide drinking water to all of their customers. The difficulty in optimizing this service involves the minimum water pressure and flow standards, as well as the strict regulations regarding water quality. The innovative technologies required to support the goal of Project Neptune are either partially evolved with no proven reliability or do not exist yet. The Centre for Sustainable Development at the [[University of Cambridge]] is heading the work on integrating [[artificial intelligence]] and mathematical simulation technologies to create an efficient online reporting and analyzing system for monitoring performance of the water distribution system.

== Research priority areas ==
In order to address the technological deficiencies of the project, research priority areas (RPA) have been identified by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The RPA three key concentrations include “data and knowledge management, pressure management (including energy management), and the associated complex decision support systems on which to base interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savic D. A.|last2=Boxall J. B.|last3=Ulanicki B.|last4=Kapelan Z.|last5=Makropoulos C.|last6=Fenner R.|last7=Soga K.|last8=Marshall I. W.|last9=Maksimovic C.|title=Project Neptune: Improved Operation of Water Distribution Networks|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41024(340)47|journal=Water Distribution Systems Analysis 2008|series=Proceedings|doi=10.1061/41024(340)47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific objectives of the RPA are focused on developing communication networks, sustainable technologies, real time information feedback system, and optimal operations. The function of the communication network is to evaluate the performance and reliability of already implemented hardware and sensors for collecting faraway data. In order to achieve a reduction in energy usage, sustainable technologies that develop innovative energy harvesting technology and reduce the necessity for constant battery replacement are necessary for the project. Real time information relates to acquiring knowledge related to performance of the water distribution system. Optimal operations can be achieved through improvement in understanding and analyzing relevant data, which includes online models of hydraulics. The first round of RPA work is contributing to the initiative headed by Yorkshire Water Services to install the first prototypes of Ground Penetrating Radar Systems (GPRS). The Yorkshire initiative aims to install around 490 prototypes that are connected to sensors that collect pressure and flow data on a half hourly basis.

== Development goals ==
Project Neptune’s academic and industrial partners aim to address the tasks of developing: energy saving options, online simulation model to provide an overlook of a full day’s water distribution patterns, system to mitigate and manage leakage, automate system adjustments, power harvesting methods, and optimized system for reacting to incidents.

Staff involved in the system controls department of the project have the burden of handling large amounts of data received. The Decision Support System (DSS) was developed in order to alleviate this burden and aid the staff in decision making, prioritizing urgent incidents, and identifying faulty alarms. The DSS functions to combine these strategy and decision making outputs into one single and comprehensive presentation of data for the operator.

== Partners and funding ==
The project today receives funding from the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in order to further advance understanding and contribute knowledge about optimal and efficient water supply systems. Industrial funding is also provided for the project, the main contributors include the United Utilities and Yorkshire Water Services. University of Exeter in the UK carries out research for the project in collaboration with seven other research universities located in the UK, including University of Cambridge, the University of Sheffield, Imperial College London, De Montfort University, Lancaster University, University of Leicester, and University of Sheffield.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6412">The '''quadrivium''' (plural: quadrivia&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14950-wisdom |title=Wisdom |last=Kohler |first=Kaufmann |work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2015-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the four subjects, or arts, taught after teaching the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]. The word is [[Latin]], meaning ''four ways'', and its use for the four subjects has been attributed to [[Boethius]] or [[Cassiodorus]] in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Part I: The Age of Augustine". ND.edu. 2010. [http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hwp205.htm ND205].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quadrivium (education)". ''[[Britannica Online]]''. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485943/quadrivium EB].
&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the [[trivium]] and the quadrivium comprised the seven [[liberal arts]] (based on thinking skills),&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Quadrivium|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; as distinguished from the practical arts (such as [[medicine]] and [[architecture]]).

The quadrivium consisted of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]]. These followed the preparatory work of the trivium, consisting of [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]. In turn, the quadrivium was considered preparatory work for the study of [[philosophy]] (sometimes called the "liberal art ''par excellence''")&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Coit Gilman|Gilman, Daniel Coit]], et al. (1905). ''[[New International Encyclopedia]]''. Lemma "Arts, Liberal".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[theology]].

==Origins==
These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by [[Plato]] in [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] and are described in the seventh book of that work (in the order Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music). &lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;
The quadrivium is implicit in early [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] writings and in the ''De nuptiis'' of [[Martianus Capella]], although the term ''quadrivium'' was not used until [[Boethius]], early in the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les Arts Libéraux dans l'Antiquité Classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts Libéraux et Philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'Études Médiévales. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Proclus]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold.  A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion.  Arithmetic, then, studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving.&lt;ref&gt;Proclus. ''A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements'', xii. trans. Glenn Raymond Morrow. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992. pp. 29–30. {{ISBN|0-691-02090-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Medieval usage==
At many medieval universities, this would have been the course leading to the degree of [[Master of Arts]] (after the [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]). After the MA, the student could enter for bachelor's degrees of the higher faculties (Theology, Medicine or Law). To this day, some of the postgraduate degree courses lead to the degree of Bachelor (the [[Bachelor of Philosophy|B.Phil]] and [[British degree abbreviations|B.Litt.]] degrees are examples in the field of philosophy).

The study was eclectic, approaching the philosophical objectives sought by considering it from each aspect of the quadrivium within the general structure demonstrated by [[Proclus]] (AD 412–485), namely arithmetic and music on the one hand&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Craig (2001). ''The Maze and the Warrior: Symbols in Architecture, Theology, and Music''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and geometry and cosmology on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, Laura Ackerman (1994). ''History, Prophecy and the Stars: Christian Astrology of Pierre D'Ailly, 1350–1420. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of music within the quadrivium was originally the classical subject of [[harmonic]]s, in particular the study of the proportions between the musical intervals created by the division of a [[monochord]]. A relationship to music as actually practised was not part of this study, but the framework of classical harmonics would substantially influence the content and structure of music theory as practised in both European and Islamic cultures.

==Modern usage==
In modern applications of the liberal arts as curriculum in colleges or universities, the quadrivium may be considered to be the study of [[number]] and its relationship to space or time: arithmetic was pure number, geometry was number in [[space]], music was number in [[time]], and astronomy was number in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Morris Kline]] classified the four elements of the quadrivium as pure (arithmetic), stationary (geometry), moving (astronomy), and applied (music) number.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Morris (1953). "The Sine of G Major". In ''Mathematics in Western Culture''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This schema is sometimes referred to as "classical education", but it is more accurately a [[Renaissance of the 12th century|development of the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance]] with recovered classical elements, rather than an organic growth from the educational systems of antiquity. The term continues to be used by the [[Classical education movement]] and at the independent [[Oundle School]], in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge |title=Oundle School – Improving Intellectual Challenge |date=27 October 2014 |website=The Boarding Schools' Association}}&lt;br /&gt;Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at [[King's College London]] on "[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx The Future of Liberal Arts]" at schools and universities.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28927">The relationship between the level of '''religiosity''' and the level of '''education''' has been studied since the second half of the 20th century.

The parameters of the two components diverse: the "level of [[religiosity]]" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate [[Scientifically based research|scientifically]], while the "[[International Standard Classification of Education|level of education]]" is easier to compile, such as [[Educational measurement|official data]] on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries.

Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether "religiosity" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt; Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Souls" /&gt;

In terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities, were religious.&lt;ref name=gross2009 /&gt;

==Studies==

===Global studies===

A [[Pew Center]] study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that [[Jews]] are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling;&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jews]] also have the highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita (61%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Based on the study data, [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Christians]] ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Christians]] were found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the study, Christians in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

According to a 2015 global survey by [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]], the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

In one analysis of [[World Values Survey]] data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; They concluded that "these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, "education raises religious attendance at individual level," while "at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere." The authors suggest that "this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief," causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/w8080.pdf |title= Education and Religion |last1= Sacerdote |first1= Bruce |last2= Glaeser|first2= Edward L.|work= |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research|page=29|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===Britain===

Research in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David Voas and Siobhan McAndrew|editor1-last=Arweck|editor1-first=Elisabeth|editor2-last=Bullivant|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Lois|title=Secularity and Non-religion|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415710442|chapter=Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===India===

A survey conducted by the ''Times of India'' revealed that 22% of [[IIT Bombay]] graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.&lt;ref name=toi2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Less than half of passing IIT batch believes in God’s existence|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Less-than-half-of-passing-IIT-batch-believes-in-Gods-existence/articleshow/46938504.cms|publisher= Times Of India|accessdate=29 September 2015}}

===United States===

According to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%.&lt;ref name="CNN GSS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Jim|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwadel said, “With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God...But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’”&lt;ref name="CNN GSS" /&gt;

Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. "The irony" he states "is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education."

He found that [[Hindus]], [[Jews]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|title=US Religious Landscape Survey: Diverse and Dynamic|format=PDF|publisher=The Pew Forum|page=85|publication-date=February 2008|accessdate=2012-09-17|ref=refEducationLevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/|title=Faith, Education and Income|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2011|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]], [[Buddhists]], and [[Orthodox Christians]]&lt;ref name="Faith, Education and Income"&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/?_r=1 Faith, Education and Income]&lt;/ref&gt; have the highest levels of education. [[Catholics]], [[Mormons]], and [[Muslims]] are at about the national average.. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Bradley R.E.|title=Christians are hate-filled hypocrites-- and other lies you've been told : a sociologist shatters myths from the secular and christian media|year=2010|publisher=Bethany House|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=9780764207464|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college.&lt;ref name="Smith Souls"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=Souls in Transition: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of Emerging adults|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195371796|pages=248–251|author2=Patricia Snell |quote=However, something very interesting emerged when scholars took a second look at the question more recently. They found that the religiously undermining effect of higher education on recent generation of youth disappeared. Most of the older research was conducted on baby boomers for whom college did indeed corrode religious faith and practice. But many studies more recently have shown that conventional wisdom about baby boomers does not apply to today's youth. Higher education no longer seem to diminish religion in emerging adults." "In every case, emerging adults are slightly more religious than those who are not in college, although only the differences in overall religiousness and service attendance are statistically significant. In short, if anything, it is ''not'' attending college that is associated with lower levels of religious practice, though those differences are slight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winseman|first1=Albert L.|title=Does More Educated Really = Less Religious?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/7729/does-more-educated-really-less-religious.aspx|website=Gallup Poll|date=February 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher "public religiosity" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less "belief." Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.&lt;ref name="Post ARIS 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kosmin|first=Barry|title=Religion and the Intelligentsia: Post-graduate Educated Americans 1990-2008|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/religion-and-the-intelligentsia-post-graduate-educated-americans-1990-2008/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).&lt;ref name="Kosmin keysar College"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kosmin|first1=Barry|last2=Keysar|first2=Ariela|title=Religious, Spiritual and Secular: The emergence of three distinct worldviews among American college students|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/isssc/Documents/ARIS_2013_College%20Students_Sept_25_final_draft.pdf|publisher=Trinity College|pages=8–9|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At "elite" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, "religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities."&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

Sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Daniel|title=Less-educated Americans turning their backs on religion|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-08/asa-lea081511.php|work=American Sociological Association|publisher=Eureka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. ''Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives''. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than [[mainline Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226764192|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt;

Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education "positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of "exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs, and Affiliations|last=Schwadel|first=Philip|year=2011|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=53|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|author=Jim Kavanagh|date=11 August 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|quote=With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God,’” he said. “But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American [[Hindus]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree, followed by [[Unitarian Universalists]] (67%), [[Jews]] (59%), [[Anglican]] (59%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (56%) and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (47%) and [[United Church of Christ]] (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cording to the same study about (43%) of American [[atheists]], and (42%) [[agnostics]], and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree.

==In specific religious denominations==

===Mormons===
Studies of [[Mormons]] in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending [[Church service|church]] regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity" Latter-Day Saint Social Life, Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members (Provo, Utah: BYU [[Religious Studies Center]], 1998), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical groups===
Edward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge —  factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton|first=Edward|title=Why does Jesus go to Oxford University?

In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that "Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics." He used [[SAT]] scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.&lt;ref&gt;

===Christian fundamentalists===
Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and [[Christian fundamentalism]] was found by Burton et al. (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Burton; Stephen Johnson; Joseph Tamney, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3511296 Education and Fundamentalism], ''Review of Religious Research'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, [[Protestant]] residents of [[Delaware County, Indiana]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4499">'''Resource justice''' (also referred to as "'''resource equity'''" or "'''resource governance'''") is a term in [[environmentalism]] and in [[environmental ethics]]. It combines elements of [[distributive justice]] and [[climate justice]] and is based on the observation that many countries rich in [[natural resource]]s such as [[mineral]]s and other [[raw material]]s nevertheless experience high levels of poverty. This [[resource curse]] is one of the main ethical reasons to demand resource justice, that is, a globally fair distribution of all natural resources.

== Factors leading to resource injustice ==

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|500px| Countries' income inequality according to their [[Gini coefficient]] – red = high, green = low inequality (World Bank, 2014)]]
The term resource justice as a subcategory of distributive justice was first developed following the repeated observation that natural resources that, supposedly, are a blessing for local populations, turn out to be a curse. This can manifest itself in a number of ways – and for a number of reasons, some of which occur in isolation but more often arise together. Some examples are:
* [[Surface mining|Mining]] or [[Oil well|oil drilling]] result in severe damage to the environment, for example through [[oil spill]]s, [[environmental degradation]], or [[Pollution|contamination]].
* The extraction of resources leads to extreme forms of [[exploitation of labour]] and / or creates very [[Work accident|hazardous working conditions]].
* Resources are being controlled by a small elite that makes or embezzles all the profits. This often goes along with [[corruption]].
* People are forced off their land to make place for resource extraction or for large [[Monoculture|monocultural]] plantations.
* Resources in the developing world are being extracted by companies from industrialised countries, with most of the profits going to the latter.
* Companies extract genetic material, which is then commercially farmed or bred – and often [[Biological patent|patented]].

== Approaches towards greater resource justice ==

[[Capacity building]] and external support in order to empower "communities affected by oil, gas, and mining operations" so that they themselves  are able to determine how local resources are being used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamamerica.org/take-action/campaign/natural-resource-justice/ Natural Resource Justice], [[Oxfam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://namati.org/lawyers-for-resource-justice/ Lawyers for Resource Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mechanisms have to be developed to make sure that finite resources are distributed in an equitable way so that poor nations' right to development is not denied.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books/about/Fair_Future.html?id=_l9U7olOSA0C Wolfgang Sachs, Tilman Santarius, Fair Future: Limited Resources and Global Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The memorandum Resource Politics for a Fair Future, published by the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] lists three criteria for a "fair and sustainable Resource Politics", namely:

The '''Sarajevo Music Academy''' or '''Music Academy | University of Sarajevo'''({{lang-bs|Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu}} or '''MAS''') is a [[Faculty of Music]] of [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unsa.ba/en/org-jedinica/music-academy&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Sarajevo Music  Academy  was founded by the Decision of the National Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 20, 1955 as the fourth such higher education institution in the former joint state, and the first established after the  [[World War II]]. This Decision was published in the official Gazette of the [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] No. 12/55, on June 8, 1955. The establishment of the Sarajevo Music  Academy preceded a number of favorable prerequisites, such as the establishment of a network of music schools, the founding of the [[Sarajevo National Theater]], Sarajevo Opera House, Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, the Institute for the study of folklore and the continuity of the [[Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra]].
At the founding of the Academy, the founders of this institution were:
*Milenko Živković, rector of the Academy of Music in Belgrade
*Dr. [[Dragotin Cvetko]], professor of the [[Academy of Music (Ljubljana)]]
*[[Natko Devčić]], professor at the [[Academy of Music, University of Zagreb]]
*Cvjetko Rihtman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/43975/|title=Rihtman, Cvjetko - Proleksis enciklopedija|website=proleksis.lzmk.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; director of the Folklore Research Institute in Sarajevo
*Miroslav Špiler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=59839|title=Špiler, Miroslav - Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of the Higher Pedagogical Academy in Sarajevo
*Strahinja Dramušić, in front of the Council for Education, Science and Culture of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a scorer
After the formation of the first pedagogical core at the Sarajevo Music Academy the first Rector was elected, prof. Cvetko Rihtman. In the first year of the Academy's work, 42 students were enrolled. Teaching at the Sarajevo Music Academy began on 19 December 1955 in seven sections:

*I   -  Department of Composition and Conducting
*II  -  Department of solo singing
*III -  Department of Piano 
*IV  -  Department of string Instruments
*V   -  Department of wind instruments
*VI  -  Department of Musicology
*VII -  Theoretical-pedagogical section

The fateful and tragic events that affected the former joint state in the nineties, made the Academy without a large number of teachers and associates, and the building was badly damaged on six occasions. One of the "holes" in the wall between the concert hall and the hallway, was inscribed and preserved the Academy's management, as a symbol of these difficult times. A large number of students left Sarajevo. Out of 45 permanently hired teachers and assistants at the Academy, only fifteen remained. The Academy has lost two-thirds of the collective. The only staff were teachers from other institutions that had been hired from time to time, and the number of students was about 50. Difficulties were  also reflected in the organization of the teaching itself and in the absence of a functional work space.
In spite of all that, the training was interrupted only once for a short time, in May 1995, due to a more intensive bombing. Teachers of the instrumental sections often held classes in their own apartments due to the unsuccessful working space, but also the safety. Regardless of the difficult circumstances of life and work, the rest of the Academy has preserved human and professional enthusiasm. Apart from the efforts to preserve the teaching process, the Academy's teachers played a major role in establishing the Orchestra of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, restarting the work of the Sarajevo Philharmonic, and the academic choir "Gaudeamus". Thanks to efforts from then dean, Osman-Faruk Sijarić&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/movies/stunned-by-war-the-arts-of-sarajevo-are-reawakening.html&lt;/ref&gt;, significant support and assistance from music academies and conservatories from Vienna, Bern, Graz, Karlsruhe, Madrid, Stockholm, was given and the Sarajevo Music Academy was registered unanonimuosly in the membership of the European Association of Music Conservatories and Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec-music.eu/members/our-members|title=Our Members|website=AEC|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[European Association of Conservatoires]]). In the war period, 15 students graduated ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]), 2 graduated ([[Master of Arts|MA]]) and one doctorate ([[PhD]]) was defended at the Academy. With huge difficulty, the Academy accomplished its basic function for almost the last decade of the 20th century.

In more than 62 years of existence and work of the Academy, there graduated over 2500 students, mastered them around 200, and about 24 doctorates were defended. About 300 teachers and associates were taking care about everything. Regardless of the great political, social and any other turbulence that strongly influenced all aspects of existence and work, the Academy had an upward developmental line. Today it is an internationally recognizable artistic and educational institution with developed departments, academic degrees, expressed artistic and scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.unsa.ba/historijat|title=Historijat - Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu|website=www.mas.unsa.ba|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41722">[[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] can be inscribed in a multidimensional model comprising different aspects of human life: [[biology]], [[Human reproduction|reproduction]], [[culture]], [[entertainment]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and [[love]].&lt;ref name= DelRe &gt;Del Re G., Bazzo G., ''Programma di educazione sessuale e relazionale-affettiva''. In  Veglia F., (2004) ''Manuale di educazione sessuale'', Vol. I, Erickson, Trento.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decades, a growing interest towards sexuality and a greater quest to acknowledge a “[[right to sexuality]]” has occurred both in [[society]] and [[individual]]s. The consequence of this evolution has been a renewed and more explicit call for intervention from those who suffer, or think they suffer from alterations of their sexual and relational sphere.

This has produced an increased attention of [[medicine]] and [[psychology]] towards [[sexual dysfunction]]s and the problems they cause in individuals and couples. Science has gradually adjusted already existing research tools, mostly used in other fields of [[clinical research]], to the field of [[sexology]], so completing and increasing the number of tools in the “toolkit” of various branches of sexological [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].&lt;ref name= Boccadoro &gt;Boccadoro L., Carulli S., (2008) ''Il posto dell'amore negato. Sessualità e psicopatologie segrete''[http://www.sexology.it]. Edizioni Tecnoprint, Ancona. {{ISBN|978-88-95554-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological measurements cannot be considered as accurate as physical ones (weight, height, mass, etc.), as the former evaluate those aspects and variables pertaining to an "individual" whose ''individuality'' refers to his/her own psychological, personological and environmental constituents: [[emotion]]s, expressiveness, senses, feelings and experiences which can greatly vary according to the subjects and change in the short period or depending on different settings, even in the same individual.

What is expected of [[Psychometrics|psychological measurements]] is "sufficient" accuracy and reliability, i.e. capability to express an indication or focus which clinicians can use as a “[[Medical guideline|guideline]]” to rapidly and accurately deepen the aspects highlighted by the measurements and check them together with their patients.&lt;ref name= DeRogatis_1 &gt;DeRogatis L.R., ''Assessment of sexual function/dysfunction via patient reported outcomes''. International Journal of Impotence Research, 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, several statistical validation indexes of [[Psychological testing|psychodiagnostic tests]] are provided: from [[standardization]] to various constructions of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] (internal, external, face, construct, convergent, content, discriminant, etc.).

There are several sexual dysfunctions and each of them has a different cause. Therefore, the field of [[sexology]] provides different psychological evaluation devices in order to examine the various aspects of the discomfort, problem or dysfunction, regardless of whether they are individual or relational ones.&lt;ref name=Basile &gt;Basile Fasolo C. et Veglia F., (1999) ''Disturbi sessuali''. In Conti L. (a cura di), ''Repertorio delle scale di valutazione in psichiatria'', S.E.E., Firenze.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[Psychological testing|psychodiagnostic reactives]] is certainly wide and heterogeneous, nevertheless, the number of tests specifically meant for the field of sexology is quite limited. The following list (in alphabetical order) is not exhaustive but shows the best known and/or most used reactives in the field of sexological and relational psychodiagnosis.

=== ASEX (Arizona Sexual Experience Scale) ===

* '' ASEX - Arizona Sexual Experience Scale'' &lt;ref name= McGahuey &gt;McGahuey C.A., Gelenberg A.J., Laukes C.A., Moreno F.A., Delgado P.L., McKnight K.M., Manber R., ''The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX): reliability and validity''. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, 26, 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

This test is intended for the assessment of [[sexual dysfunction]]s in psychiatric patients and people with health problems (men and women). It particularly evaluates modifications and alterations of [[sexual function]]s in relation to the intake of medicines or psychotropic substances.&lt;br /&gt;
This self-report questionnaire can be both administered by a clinician or self-administered. It is made up of 5 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale.
Each item explores a particular aspect of sexuality: 1. Sexual drive, 2. Arousal, 3a. Penile erection; 3b. Vaginal lubrication, 4. Ability to reach orgasm, 5. Satisfaction from orgasm. &lt;br /&gt;
Only one item of the scale has a male and a female version (3a – 3b). &lt;br /&gt;
This test provides good [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] indexes with a Cronbach's coefficient alpha of 0,90 and correlation (at intervals of 1 and 2 weeks) with r = 0,80. The “validity of the construction” has been evaluated by several studies through differences in the scores obtained by sample groups (dysfunctional patients) and control groups.&lt;ref name= Soykan_a &gt;Soykan A., ''The reliability and validity of Arizona sexual experiences scale in Turkish ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis''. International Journal of Impotence Research, 16, 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Soykan_b &gt;Soykan A., Boztaş H., Idilman R., Ozel E.T., Tüzün A.E., Ozden A., Ozden A., Kumbasar H., ''Sexual dysfunctions in HCV patients and its correlations with psychological and biological variables''. International Journal of Impotence Research,17 ,2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Sukan &gt;Sukan M., Maner F., ''The problems in sexual functions of vitiligo and chronic urticaria patients''. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, 33, 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Convergent and discriminant validity have been measured comparing the results obtained by ASEX with those obtained by other tests. Particularly, it has been found a significant correlation between ASEX and BISF (Brief Index of Sexual Functioning),&lt;ref name= Taylor &gt;Taylor J.F., Rosen R.C., Leiblum S.R., ''Self-report assessment of female sexual function: Psychometric evaluation of the brief index of sexual functioning for women''.

=== ASKAS (Aging Sexuality Knowledge and Attitudes Scale) ===

* ''ASKAS - Aging Sexuality Knowledge and Attitudes Scale'' &lt;ref name= White_a &gt;White C.B., ''A Scale for the Assessment of Attitudes and Knowledge Regarding Sexuality in the Aged.'' Paper presented at the 89th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association, Los Angeles, CA, August 24–26, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

This questionnaire is aimed at knowing sexuality and sexual attitudes in the [[Old age|elderly]]. It is made up of 61 items divided into two subscales: “''Knowledge subscale''”, a 35-item scale with “True/False” and “I don't know” answers and “''Attitudes subscale''” which is composed of  26 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale. Both subscales provide good reliability indexes (from 0,97 to 0,72) for Cronbach's alpha, test-retest and split half methods measured on different types of groups: ''[[Nursing]] home resident'', ''Community older adults'', ''Family of older adults'', ''Persons who work with older adults'', ''Nursing home staff''. &lt;br /&gt;
According to several studies carried out by the same author, sexual behaviour and attitudes during older age reflects those adopted during younger age, in fact:
* those people who were sexually active during youth tend to maintain this behaviour during older age;
* negative attitudes towards sex learned during youth can significantly affect the ability to have good sexuality during older age.
ASKAS has been used to study the effects of [[Sex education|sexual education]] on the attitudes of [[nursing home]] residents, their relatives and nursing home staff towards sexuality in the elderly. It has been noted that, after receiving sexual education, nursing home staff and relatives were more tolerant towards [[sexual intercourse]] in older age. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the sexual activity and satisfaction in those elderly people who had been given sexual education.&lt;ref name= White_b&gt;White C.B., Catania J.A., ''Psychoeducational Intervention for Sexuality with the Aged, Family Members of the Aged and People Who Work with the Aged''. International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 15, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
An Italian [[Statistical survey|survey]] carried out through a translated version of ASKAS among general practitioners has found that almost the entire sample (N=95) knew that sexuality is a lifelong need and it is not hazardous to elderly people's health, but, at the same time, it has revealed a lot of fallacies, confusion, stereotypes and lack of accurate knowledge of sexuality in old men and old women.&lt;ref name= Capodieci_a &gt;Capodieci S., Canu B., ''Il medico di base e il complesso del figlio di Noè.''

#
This scale is made up of 32 items which explore 4 interdependent dimensions in order to evaluate relational adaptation between husband and wife: ''agreement'' between husband and wife on important matters, ''cohesion'' of the couple on common activities, ''satisfaction'' of the couple with the progress of their [[Intimate relationship|relationship]], ''expression'' of satisfaction with their affective and sexual life.

* ''DIQ - Diagnostic Impotence Questionnaire'' &lt;ref name=Cole&gt;Cole M., Dryden W., (1989) ''Sex Problems: Your Questions Answered''. MacDonald, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
This questionnaire (35 item) evaluates the different components in male [[erectile dysfunction]]: Vascular (V), Neurogenic (N), Hormonal (H), Psychogenic (P).
The scores of V-N-H components provide information about those organic factors responsible for the dysfunction; the scores of P component indicate the influence of the psychogenic component. If the total score of V-N-H components is higher than the score of P component, then the organic etiology prevails over the psychogenic one (and vice versa).
This device is useful in the [[Impotence#Diagnosis|clinic setting]]. However, due to the fact that it is not validated nor [[Structured interview|standardised]], it must be used carefully in [[research]]es and [[Screening (medicine)|screenings]].

#
A self-evaluation [[questionnaire]] on erectile dysfunction which is meant for male patients (13 items) and their partners (5 items). It explores achievements, perceived satisfaction, and treatment effectiveness.
The items meant for male patients study expectations, effectiveness, side effects and their willingness to continue with the treatment. The items meant for their partners explore the changes occurred in the couple's sexual activity and allow to notice the concordance between the subjective answers of the patients and the objective ones provided by theirs partners.

* ''EPES - Erotic Preferences Examination Scheme'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://individual.utoronto.ca/ray_blanchard/index_files/EPES.html Paraphilia scales from Kurt Freund's Erotic Preferences Examination Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;
This is one of the oldest self-report questionnaire measures of the various paraphilias listed in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

The EPES includes scales for sexual masochism (11 items), sexual sadism (20 items), fetishism (8 items), cross-gender fetishism—transvestism (11 items), autogynephilia—a man’s tendency to be erotically aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman (8 items), pedophilia (18 items), hebephilia—the erotic preference for pubescent, as opposed to prepubescent, children (9 items), voyeurism (6 items), and exhibitionism (13 items). The alpha reliability coefficients for these scales run from .74 to .98.

:''Main article:'' [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]]

A test published in 1942 by the ''[[University of Minnesota]]'', it was revised  in 1989 when the current version [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory#MMPI-2 RF|MMPI-2]] was created (last release Restructured Form in 2003).
The MMPI-2 is made up of a considerable number of items (567) which explore several features of personality pertaining psychology and psychiatry. There are also an abridged version (370 items) and a version called [[MMPI-A]] of 478 items (350 items in a short form) aimed at evaluating adolescent between the age of 14 and 18.&lt;br /&gt;
The dimensions taken into account are divided into: ''Basic Scales'' (which evaluate the most relevant features of personality), ''Content Scales'' (which analyse different variables of personality), ''Supplementary Scales'' (which further investigate some of the issues in the basic scales), ''Validity Scales'' (which define the degree of sincerity and accuracy in filling the questionnaire).&lt;br /&gt;
The evaluation of '''''sexual''''' and '''''relational''''' settings takes into account the following aspects: ''[[masculinity]]'' – ''[[femininity]]'' (i.e. those aspects typically viewed as  masculine or feminine, considered as a whole), ''masculine and feminine'' ''[[gender role]]'' (i.e. perception of gender role), ''marital distress and family discord'' (i.e. conflicts within the couple), ''[[Extraversion and introversion|social introversion]]'' (i.e. difficulties in social relations).&lt;br /&gt;
[[MMPI-2#Criticism and controversy|Criticisms of this device]] relate to the amount of time required to fill it in (60–120 minutes) and to the fact that some of the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory#RC and Clinical Scales|Restructured Clinical]] Scales, although regarded as clearer and easier to interpret, raised some controversies in the academic world because they have been modified compared to those in the original version.

[[Image:Graf1 Sesamo test.jpg|thumb|SESAMO Sexrelational Test diagram's example]]
A [[Structured interview|standardised]] and [[Validity (statistics)|validated]] self-administering and self-evaluation [[questionnaire]]. It studies the dysfunctional aspects in individual and couple [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] besides family, social, affective and relational aspects. 
It consists of two questionnaires (i.e. a male and a female questionnaire) which are divided in two subsections each: one for singles and one for people with a partner.
The number of items in each questionnaire is variable: 135 items for singles and 173 for people with a partner. The explored dimensions are 16 for singles and 18 for people living a dyadic situation.
This questionnaire can be directly self-administered on the computer (''[[self-assessment]]''); after that the software elaborates the questionnaire and produces a report made up of 9 sections. Each of these sections has several levels of further diagnostic analysis.
A short version of this questionnaire, called ''Sexuality Evaluation Schedule [[Psychological evaluation|Assessment]] Monitoring'',&lt;ref name=Boccadoro_b&gt;Boccadoro L., (1996) ''SESAMO: Sexuality Evaluation Schedule Assessment Monitoring. Questionario Sessualità''. [http://www.giuntios.it O.S.], Firenze. IT\ICCU\CFI\0327719.&lt;/ref&gt; has a lower number of items and can be administered only through the paper and pencil method.
The disadvantages of this evaluation/research tool are the time required for filling in the questionnaire and the fact that the complete [[Case report form|Report]] can be elaborated only by the software.

This test investigates [[sexual arousal]] and [[Sexual inhibition|inhibition]] in women through a 115-item questionnaire rated on a 4-point Likert scale. &lt;br /&gt;
The areas concerning '''sexual arousal''' are: ''Arousability'' (arousal and sexual stimulation); ''Sexual power dynamics'' (power dynamics in sexuality); ''Smell'' (arousing smells); ''Partner characteristics''; ''Setting'' (unusual or unconcealed settings). &lt;br /&gt;
'''Sexual inhibition''' factors are: ''Relationship importance''; ''Arousal contingency'' (arousal-related factors); ''Concerns about sexual function'' (concerns about the consequences of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]). &lt;br /&gt;
This test is based on the conditioning of sexual response: sexual arousal is controlled by the balance of several factors, all of which contribute to arousal or inhibition.&lt;ref name= Basson &gt;Basson R., ''The female sexual response: A different model''.

Archives of Sexual Behavior, 6(5), 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
SHQ-R is a fully validated and standardised self-report questionnaire, revised in 2002. It is composed of 508 items exploring several areas of male sexuality: &lt;br /&gt;
I. ''Childhood and Adolescent Sexual Experiences'' (a scale to measure sexual experiences and [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] during childhood and adolescence); &lt;br /&gt;
II. ''Sexual Dysfunction'' (a scale which evaluates [[sexual dysfunction]]s such as [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], [[hypersexuality]] and [[Premature ejaculation|premature]] or [[Delayed ejaculation|retarded]] ejaculation); &lt;br /&gt;
III. ''Adult Age/Gender Sexual Outlets'' (seven scales measuring the frequency of various sexual activities with adults, children and adolescents); &lt;br /&gt;
IV. ''Fantasy and Pornography'' (three scales measuring sexual fantasies involving women, men and the use of pornography); &lt;br /&gt;
V. ''Transvestism, Fetishism, and Feminine Gender Identity'' (three scales which evaluate personal experiences with regard to transvestism, sexual fetishes and identification with female gender traits); &lt;br /&gt;
VI. ''[[Courtship disorder|Courtship Disorders]]'' (six scales which take into consideration several aspects of “disturbed courtship”: [[voyeurism]], [[exhibitionism]], [[Obscene phone call|obscene telephone calls]], [[frotteurism]]/toucherism and [[sexual assault]]). &lt;br /&gt;
This test also includes two validity indicators: a “Lie scale” (insincere answers) and an “Infrequency scale” (infrequent answers).

#
A [[Structured interview|standardised]] self-evaluation questionnaire made up of 17 items with 6 answers each. It gathers information about sexual interactions within [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] couples. The result is obtained through a cross evaluation of the answers both partners have separately given in their respective questionnaires.
Manual scoring of rough points, which are then converted into percentages to be used to create a diagram which shows a sexual interaction profile for each couple.

#
A 400-item checklist relating partner's behaviours to be filled in by husband and wife for two weeks. 
It takes into account 12 behavioural categories: love, solidarity, consideration, sexuality, communication, couple's activities, children's care, home management, decisions about financial matters, job, personal habits and independence of both partners.
It is similar to ''MAP - Marital Agendas Protocol'' &lt;ref name=Notarius&gt;Notarius C.I. et Vanzetti N.A., (1983) ''The Marital Agendas Protocol''. In Filsinger E.E., (1983) ''Marriage and Family Assessment: A Sourcebook for Family Therapy''. Sage Publications, Beverly Hills.&lt;/ref&gt; in many aspects. This type of daily diaries are chiefly used in marriage [[Counseling psychology|counselling]] in order to evaluate conflict management and couple satisfaction/dissatisfaction.

=== SOS (Sexual Opinion Survey) ===

* ''SOS - Sexual Opinion Survey'' &lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;
#
A 21-item scale which explores subjects' attitude towards several sexual aspects: [[heterosexuality]], [[homosexuality]], [[Sexual fantasy|erotic fantasies]], [[Sexual stimulation|sexual stimuli]], etc.

=== TIPE (Test di Induzione Psico Erotica) ===

* ''TIPE – Test di Induzione Psico Erotica'' &lt;ref name=Valente&gt;Valente Torre L., Abraham G. (2006) ''TIPE – Test di Induzione Psico Erotica''. Organizzazioni Speciali, Firenze.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
The ''Psycho Erotic Induction Test'' is a [[projective test]], [[Structured interview|standardised]] for evaluating erotic imagery. It is made up of 8 tables concerning four specific issues: situations during childhood, initiative in love relationships, competitiveness and function of the group.

=== WIQ (Waring Intimacy Questionnaire) ===

* ''WIQ - Waring Intimacy Questionnaire'' &lt;ref name=Waring&gt;Waring E.M. et Reddon J.R., ''The measurement of intimacy in marriage: the Waring Intimacy Questionnaire''. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 39, 53, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
This scale is made up of 90 items analysing 9 aspects relating couple's intimacy: sexuality, love, expressiveness, marital cohesion, couple compatibility, partners' independence, conflicts, social identity and [[Social desirability bias|desirability bias]]. This scale seems to be reliable and free from sexual preconceptions although plethoric in conceptualising some of the items.

'''Sexology''' is the scientific study of [[human sexuality]], including human sexual interests, [[Human sexual activity|behavior]]s and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexology|title=Sexology|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sexology'' does not generally refer to the non-scientific study of sexuality, such as [[political science]] or [[social criticism]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt;

Sexologists apply tools from several academic fields, such as [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[sociology]], and [[criminology]]. Topics of study include [[sexual development]] (puberty), [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual relationship]]s, sexual activities, [[paraphilia]]s, atypical sexual interests.  It also includes the study of sexuality across the lifespan, including [[child sexuality]], [[puberty]], [[adolescent sexuality]], and [[geriatric sexology|sexuality among the elderly]]. Sexology also spans sexuality among the mentally and/or physically disabled. The sexological study of [[sexual dysfunction]]s and disorders, including [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anorgasmia]], and [[pedophilia]], are also mainstays.

==History==
===Early===
[[sex manual|Sexual manuals]] have existed since antiquity, such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], the ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'' and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]''.  {{lang|fr|De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris}} (''Prostitution in the City of Paris''), an early 1830s study on 3,558 registered prostitutes in [[Paris]], published by Alexander Jean Baptiste Parent-Duchatelet (and published in 1837, a year after he died), has been called the first work of modern sex research.&lt;ref name=Bullough1989&gt;Bullough, V. L. (1989). ''The society for the scientific study of sex: A brief history.'' Mt. Vernon, Iowa: The Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of sexual behavior in human beings began in the 19th century. Shifts in [[Europe]]'s national borders at that time brought into conflict laws that were sexually liberal and laws that criminalized behaviors such as homosexual activity.

===Victorian Era to WWII===
[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|thumb|[[Havelock Ellis]], a pioneering figure in the movement towards sexual emancipation in the late 19th century.]]

Despite the prevailing social attitude of sexual repression in [[Victorian morality|the Victorian era]], the movement towards sexual emancipation began towards the end of the nineteenth century in England and Germany. In 1886, [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]] published ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]].'' That work is considered as having established sexology as a scientific discipline.&lt;ref name = Hoenig1977&gt;Hoenig, J. (1977). Dramatis personae: Selected biographical sketches of 19th century pioneers in sexology. In J. Money and H. Musaph (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexology,'' (pp. 21-43). Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the founding father of sexology was the doctor and sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]] who challenged the sexual taboos of his era regarding [[masturbation]] and [[homosexuality]] and revolutionized the conception of sex in his time. His seminal work was the 1897 ''Sexual Inversion'', which describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, (the term was coined by Kertbeny) as he did not characterize it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age [[taboo]]s as well as gender taboos. Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of inter-generational relationships. He also developed other important psychological concepts, such as [[autoerotism]] and [[narcissism]], both of which were later developed further by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|author1=Laplanche, J.|author2=Pontalis, J.B.|date=1988|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9780946439492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA45|page=45|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis pioneered [[transgender]] phenomena alongside the German [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. He established it as new category that was separate and distinct from homosexuality.&lt;ref name=ttp&gt;Ekins, Richard and King, Dave (2006) ''The transgender phenomenon'', SAGE, {{ISBN|0-7619-7163-7}}, pp. 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of Hirschfeld's studies of [[transvestism]], but disagreeing with his terminology, in 1913 Ellis proposed the term ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ellis1933&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Psychology of Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSLybrnLVeIC&amp;pg=PA209year=1933|isbn=9781443735322|publisher=Read Books|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5dNnT3GuF_gC&amp;dq=father+of+sexology+ellis|title=The Real Facts Of Life: Feminism And The Politics Of Sexuality C1850-1940|author=Jackson, Margaret|year=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203992395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the first scholarly journal of the field, ''Journal of Sexology'' (Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft), began publication and was published monthly for one year. Those issues contained articles by Freud, [[Alfred Adler]], and [[Wilhelm Stekel]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle&gt;Haeberle, E. J. (1983). ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents.'' World Association for Sexology.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the first academic association was founded: the ''Society for Sexology''.&lt;ref&gt;Kewenig, W. A. (1983). Foreword. In E. J. Haeberle, ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents''. World Association for Sexology. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud developed a theory of sexuality. These stages of development include: Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latency and Genital. These stages run from infancy to puberty and onwards.&lt;ref name="gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14969 |title=Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex by Sigmund Freud - Free Ebook |publisher=gutenberg.org|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his studies of his clients, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Otto Gross]], were disciples of Freud, but rejected by his theories{{vague|date=November 2013}} because of their emphasis on the role of sexuality in the revolutionary struggle for the emancipation of mankind.

[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|left|thumb|Hirschfeld's books were burned by the Nazis in Berlin for being "un-German".]]
Pre-Nazi Germany, under the sexually liberal [[Napoleonic code]], organized and resisted the anti-sexual, Victorian cultural influences. The momentum from those groups led them to coordinate sex research across traditional [[academic discipline]]s, bringing Germany to the leadership of sexology. Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was an outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, founding the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, Dustin (2008). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer movements. In A. Lind &amp; S. Brzuzy (Eds.), ''Battleground: Women, gender, and sexuality, 2,'' 291. Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld also set up the first [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in Berlin in 1919. Its library housed over 20,000 volumes, 35,000 photographs, a large collection of art and other objects. People from around [[Europe]] visited the Institute to gain a clearer understanding of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and to be treated for their sexual concerns and dysfunctions.

Hirschfeld developed a system which identified numerous actual or hypothetical types of sexual intermediary between heterosexual male and female to represent the potential diversity of human sexuality, and is credited with identifying a group of people that today are referred to as [[transsexual]] or [[transgender]] as separate from the categories of homosexuality, he referred to these people as 'transvestiten' (transvestites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Die Transvestiten. Eine Untersuchung über den erotischen Verkleidungstrieb. Mit umfangreichen casuistischen und historischen | location= Leipzig | publisher= Verlag von Max Spohr (Ferd. Spohr) | year= 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Homosexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes | location= Berlin | year= 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's dominance in sexual behavior research ended with the [[Nazi Party|Nazi regime]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt; The Institute and its library were destroyed by the Nazis less than three months after they took power, May 8, 1933.&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt; The institute was shut down and Hirschfeld's books were burned.

Other sexologists in the early [[gay rights]] movement included [[Ernst Burchard]], [[Hans Blüher]], and [[Benedict Friedlaender]]. [[Ernst Gräfenberg]], after whom the [[G-spot]] is named, published the initial research developing the [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).

===Post WWII===
After World War II, sexology experienced a renaissance, both in the United States and Europe. Large scale studies of sexual behavior, sexual function, and [[sexual dysfunction]] gave rise to the development of [[sex therapy]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt; Post-WWII sexology in the U.S. was influenced by the influx of European refugees escaping the Nazi regime and the popularity of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey studies]]. Until that time, American sexology consisted primarily of groups working to end [[prostitution]] and to educate youth about [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] founded the [[Institute for Sex Research]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] at [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] in 1947. This is now called the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]]. He wrote in his 1948 book that more was scientifically known about the sexual behavior of farm animals than of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred C. | last2 = Martin | first2 = Clyde E. | last3 = Pomeroy | first3 = Wardell B. | author-link1 = Alfred Kinsey | author-link2 = Clyde Martin | author-link3 = Wardell Pomeroy | title = Sexual behavior in the human male | page = 3 | publisher = W.B. Saunders | location = New York and Philadelphia | year = 1948 | oclc = 705195970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and sexologist [[John Money]] developed theories on sexual identity and [[gender identity]] in the 1950s. His work, notably on the [[David Reimer]] case has since been regarded as controversial, even while the case was key to the development of treatment protocols for [[intersex]] infants and children.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Milton | last2 = Sigmundson | first2 = H.

[[Kurt Freund]] developed the [[penile plethysmograph]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in the 1950s. The device was designed to provide an objective measurement of [[sexual arousal]] in males and is currently used in the assessment of [[pedophilia]] and [[hebephilia]]. This tool has since been used with [[sex offenders]].&lt;ref name="apobit"&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | title = Kurt Freund, 82, notable sexologist | url = http://www.s-t.com/daily/10-96/10-29-96/c06wn888.htm | date = October 26, 1996 }} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kubanobit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kuban | first = Michael | title = Sexual Science Mentor: Dr. Kurt Freund | journal = Sexual Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | url = http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215801/http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-12-22 | date = Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 and 1970, [[Masters and Johnson]] released their works ''Human Sexual Response'' and ''Human Sexual Inadequacy,'' respectively. Those volumes sold well, and they were founders of what became known as the [[Masters &amp; Johnson Institute]] in 1978.

[[Vern Bullough]] was a historian of sexology during this era, as well as being a researcher in the field.&lt;ref name="vernbullough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727172744/http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archivedate=July 27, 2004 |dead-url=yes |title=Dr. Vern L. Bullough: Profile |publisher=web.archive.org |website=vernbullough.com |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s caused a dramatic shift in sexological research efforts towards understanding and controlling the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gagnon | first = John H. | title = Sex research and sexual conduct in the era of AIDS | journal = [[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 593–601 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] | pmid = 3225745 | date = December 1988 | url = http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/1988/12000/Sex_Research_and_Sexual_Conduct_in_the_Era_of.11.aspx | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Oriel | first = Jennifer | title = Sexual pleasure as a human right: Harmful or helpful to women in the context of HIV/AIDS? | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 392–404 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/248654/original/sexual+pleasure+as+a+HR.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Space syntax - Global Integration - Brasilia.svg|thumb|250px|Map of axis lines in Brasília. The colors show the global integration of the different streets, measuring the accessibility of a topological line for the entire system according to the spatial analysis of the space syntax. Created with Mindwalk 1.0]]
The term '''space syntax''' encompasses a set of theories and techniques for the analysis of spatial configurations. It was conceived by [[Bill Hillier]], [[Julienne Hanson]] and colleagues at [[The Bartlett]], [[University College London]] in the late 1970s to early 1980s as a tool to help urban planners simulate the likely social effects of their designs.

==Thesis==
The general idea is that spaces can be broken down into components, analyzed as networks of choices, then represented as maps and graphs that describe the relative connectivity and integration of those spaces. It rests on three basic conceptions of space:
*  an '''[[isovist]]''' (popularised by [[Michael Benedikt (urbanist)|Michael Benedikt]] at [[University of Texas]]), or viewshed or visibility polygon, the field of view from any particular point
*  '''axial space''' (idea popularized by Bill Hillier at UCL), a straight sight-line and possible path
*  '''convex space''' (popularized by John Peponis, and his collaborators at Georgia Tech), an occupiable void where, if imagined as a wireframe diagram, no line between two of its points goes outside its perimeter: all points within the polygon are visible to all other points within the polygon.

The three most popular ways of analysing a street network are '''Integration''', '''Choice''' and '''Depth Distance'''.
*  '''Integration''' measures how many turns have to be made from a street segment to reach all other street segments in the network, using shortest paths. If the number of turns required for reaching all segments in the graph is analyzed, the analysis is said to measure integration at radius 'n'. The first intersecting segment requires only one turn, the second two turns and so on. The street segments that require the fewest turns to reach all other streets are called 'most integrated' and are usually represented with hotter colors, such as red or yellow. Integration can also be analyzed in local scale instead of the scale of the whole network. In the case of radius 4, for instance, only four turns are counted departing from each street segment.

Theoretically, the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street, and is often argued to 'predict' the pedestrian use of a street: the easier it is to reach a street, the more popular it should be. While there is some evidence of this being true, the method is biased towards long, straight streets that intersect with lots of other streets. Such streets, as [[Oxford Street]] in London, come out as especially strongly integrated. However, a slightly curvy street of the same length would typically be segmented into individual straight segments, not counted as a single line, which makes curvy streets appear less integrated in the analysis.

*  The '''Choice''' measure is easiest to understand as a 'water-flow' in the street network. Imagine that each street segment is given an initial load of one unit of water, which then starts pours from the starting street segment to all segments that successively connect to it. Each time an intersection appears, the remaining value of flow is divided equally amongst the splitting streets, until all the other street segments in the graph are reached. For instance, at the first intersection with a single other street, the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half, and allocated to the two intersecting street segments. Moving further down, the remaining one half value is again split among the intersecting streets and so on. When the same procedure has been conducted using each segment as a starting point for the initial value of one, a graph of final values appears. The streets with the highest total values of accumulated flow are said to have the highest choice values.

Like Integration, Choice analysis can be restricted to limited local radii, for instance 400m, 800m, 1600m. Interpreting Choice analysis is trickier than Integration. Space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets, but, strictly speaking, Choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street. However, since flow values are divided (not subtracted) at each intersection, the output shows an exponential distribution. It is considered best to take a log of base two of the final values in order to get a more accurate picture.

*  '''Depth Distance''' is the most intuitive of the analysis methods. It explains the linear distance from the center point of each street segment to the center points of all the other segments. If every segment is successively chosen as a starting point, a graph of accumulative final values is achieved. The streets with lowest Depth Distance values are said to be nearest to all the other streets. Again, the search radius can be limited to any distance.

===Applications===
From these components it is thought to be possible to quantify and describe how easily navigable any space is, useful for the design of museums, airports, hospitals, and other settings where [[wayfinding]] is a significant issue. Space syntax has also been applied to predict the correlation between spatial layouts and social effects such as crime, traffic flow, and [[sales per unit area]].

==History==
Space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970's when Bill Hillier, Adrian Leaman and Alan Beattie came together at the School of Environmental Studies at UCL (now known as the Bartlett). Bill Hillier had been appointed Director of the Unit for Architectural Studies (UAS) as successor to John Musgrove. They established a new MSc programme in Advanced Architectural Studies and embarked on a programme of research aimed at developing a theoretical basis for architecture. Previously Bill Hillier had written papers with others as secretary to the RIBA, notably 'Knowledge and Design' and 'How is Design Possible'. These laid the theoretical foundation for a series of studies that sought to clarify how the built environment relates to society. One of the first cohort of students on the MScAAS was Julienne Hanson who went on to co-author The Social Logic of Space (SLS) with Bill Hillier (CUP, 1984). This brought together in one place a comprehensive review of the programme of research up to that point, but also developed a full theoretical account for how the buildings and settlements we construct an not merely the product of social processes, but also play a role in producing social forms. SLS also developed an analytic approach to representation and quantification of spatial configuration at the building and the settlement scale, making possible both comparative studies as well as analysis of the relationship between spatial configuration and aspect of social function in the built environment. These methods coupled to the social theories have turned out to have a good deal of explanatory power. Space syntax has grown to become a tool used around the world in a variety of research areas and design applications in [[architecture]], [[urban design]], planning, [[transport]] and [[interior design]]. In general, the analysis uses one of many [[Spatial network analysis software|software programs]] that allow researchers to analyse graphs of one (or more) of the primary spatial components.

Over the past decade, Space syntax techniques have been used for research in [[archaeology]], [[information technology]], urban and human [[geography]], and [[anthropology]]. Since 1997, the Space syntax community has held biennial conferences, and many journal papers have been published on the subject, chiefly in [http://www.envplan.com Environment and Planning B].

==Criticism==
Space syntax's mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with 'axial maps', one of the method's primary representations of spatial configuration. This paradox was proposed by [[Carlo Ratti]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], but comprehensively refuted in a passionate academic exchange with Bill Hillier and Alan Penn [2004]. There have been moves to combine space syntax with more traditional [[transport engineering]] models, using intersections as nodes and constructing [[visibility graph]]s to link them, by researchers including [[Bin Jiang]], Valerio Cutini and [[Michael Batty]]. Recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in [[Geographic Information System|GIS]], such as the [[place syntax]]-models developed by the research group [[Spatial Analysis]] and Design at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. A series of [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437106001282; http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/b32045 interdisciplinary works] published from 2006 by [http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~latora/ Vito Latora], [https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/portasergioprof/ Sergio Porta] and colleagues, proposing a network approach to [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-84996-396-1_6 street centrality analysis] and [http://www.placelogic.org.uk design], have highlighted Space Syntax' contribution to decades of previous studies in [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037015730500462X the physics of spatial complex networks].

A '''stabilized liquid membrane device''' or '''SLMD''' is a type of [[Environmental monitoring|passive sampling device]] which allows for the [[In situ|in situ]], integrative collection of waterborne, [[Lability|labile]] ionic metal contaminants.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;Brumbaugh, W.G., Petty, J.D., Huckins, J.N., Manahan, S.E. 2002. Stabilized liquid membrane device (SLMD) for the passive, integrative sampling of labile metals in water. Water, Air, Soil Pollut. 133, 109–119.&lt;/ref&gt; By capturing and sequestering metal ions onto its surface continuously over a period of days to weeks, an SLMD can provide an integrative measurement of [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] toxic metal ions present in the aqueous environment.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;Petty, J.D., Brumbaugh, W.G., Huckins, T.W.M., Wiedmeyer, R. 2001. US Patent No. US006296760B1.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they have been used in conjunction with other passive samplers in ecological field studies.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;2012. Potential Causes for Impairment of Rainbow Trout Early Life stages and Loss of Benthic Biodiversity in Indian Creek. Washington State Department of Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a7&gt;Brumbaugh, W.G., May, W.T., Besser, J.M., Allert, A.L., Schmitt, C.J. 2008. Assessment of Elemental Concentrations in Streams of the New Lead Belt in Southeastern Missouri, 2002-05. Scientific Investigations Report 2007-5057.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Passive samplers were first developed in the early 1970s to monitor concentrations of airborne contaminants industrial workers might be exposed to, but by the 1990s researchers had developed and utilized passive samplers to monitor contaminants in the aqueous environment.&lt;ref name=a2&gt;Alvarez, D. 2013. Development of Semipermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) and Polar Organic Integrative Samplers (POCIS) for Environmental Monitoring. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. 23: 2179–2181.&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of passive sampler made for use in the aqueous environment was the [[Semipermeable membrane devices|semipermeable membrane device]] (SPMD).&lt;ref name=a2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SPMDs could be used to determine time-weighted average concentrations of [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] organic contaminants, but until the early 2000s passive sampling devices for metal contaminants had not yet emerged.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Metals in the environment can speciate into different forms. Most metals dissolved in the aqueous environment are present as any of several ionic, complex-ion, and organically bound states.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For most toxic metals, bioavailability is greatest for labile metals in their free ionic state.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the potential usefulness of a passive sampling device that could be used to measure trace amounts of bioavailable toxic metals, researchers at the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) and [[University of Missouri-Columbia]] began development on a counterpart to SPMDs that could be used to sample for labile metals.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and function ==
The outer portion of a SLMD consists of a section of sealed, flat, semi-permeable polyethylene tubing. Sealed inside this tubing is a 1:1 mixture of a hydrophobic [[Chelation|metal complexing agent]] and a long chain [[Organic acid|organic acid]].&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The organic acid diffuses through the tubing to the outer surface, where the [[carboxylic acid]] portion can form stable complexes with calcium and magnesium ions in the water.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a waxy layer to slowly accumulate on the outside of the tube. the metal complexing agent continuously mobilizes into this waxy layer, where it can sequester metal ions from the water.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrophobic metal complexing agent most commonly used in SLMDs is an [[Alkylation|alkylated]] 8-hyroxyquinoline.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oleic acid]] is commonly used as the other half of the 1:1 hydrophobic reagent mixture, as it readily forms calcium oleates in the aqueous sampling media.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the base device, hydrophobic plastic sheaths are sometimes used to house SLMDs in the field.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Variable water flow can alter the sampling rates of metals by SLMDs, making a time-averaged concentration difficult to determine.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing liable metal analytes to diffuse to the SLMD's surface while limiting the diffusion of particulate, [[colloidal]], or humic substances, these hydrophobic sheaths help reduce variability of SLMD uptake in faster moving waters.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After being deployed for a known time interval, SLMDs can be recovered from the field for analysis. Washing with 20% [[nitric acid]] allows for the extraction of accumulated metals, and by using analytical techniques like [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy]] (ICP-MS) or [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (flame AAS)  to measure the concentration of metal in the extract, the amount of metal accumulated by the SLMD can be determined.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
SLMDs are known to accumulate [[cadmium]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[lead]], and [[zinc]],&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and have been deployed in freshwater monitoring studies by The Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology)&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the USGS.&lt;ref name=a6&gt;United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center. May 2004. Retrieved 5/28/2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ecology deployed SLMDs in upper and lower Indian Creek for 28 and 27 days respectively.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Metal concentrations on the SLMDs were used to estimate the true concentration of metals in the creek. The estimated concentration was expressed as a range based on sampling rate of SLMDs as well as the length of exposure. The purpose of the sampling was to investigate potential causes of sublethal effects of young trout and loss of benthic biodiversity in the creek.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and limitations ==
Toxic metals can be present in the aqueous environment at [[Trace element|trace]] or ultra-trace concentrations, yet still be toxicologically significant and thus cause harm to humans or the environment.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because these concentrations are so low, they would fall beyond the [[detection limit]]s of most analytical instruments if the media had been sampled using traditional grab samples.&lt;ref name=a3&gt;Petty, J.D., Huckins, J.N. Alvarez, D.A., Brumbaugh, W.G., Cranor W.L., Gale, R.W., Rastall, A.C., Jones-Lepp T.L., Leiker T.J., Rostad C.E., Furlong E.T., 2004. A holistic passive integrative sampling approach for assessing the presence and potential impacts of waterborne environmental contaminants. Chemosphere 54, 695-709.&lt;/ref&gt; Using SLMDs to passively collect metals over an extended period of time allows for trace metals to accumulate to detectable levels, which can give more accurate estimate of aquatic chemistry and contamination.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SLMDs also have the advantage of being able to capture pulses of metal contamination that might otherwise go undetected when using [[Grab sample|grab samples]].&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
SLMDs are limited to the assessment of labile metals, and cannot be used to monitor for [[Organic compound|organic contaminants]]. Further, while the ability of SLMDs to sample copper, zinc, nickel, lead, and cadmium has been repeatedly demonstrated,&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a7&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; there has been little laboratory research on their ability to reliably uptake other toxic metals. Still, while laboratory studies on the effectiveness of SLMDs have only investigated copper, zinc, nickel, lead, and cadmium, SLMDs have been used with success in field studies to assess a wider range of metals.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainability standards and certifications''' are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are perhaps up to 500 such standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of [[Ecolabel]]s and standards for [[Organic food]] and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Overview article on sustainability standards in the food industry]&lt;/ref&gt; A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.

The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and [[NGO]] movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203029/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/sweatshops/nike/ |Global Exchange Campaign - Nike]&lt;/ref&gt; and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “[[sweatshop]]” factories by the likes of [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the [[SA8000]] and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the [[Fairtrade]] movement, administered by [[FLO International]] and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx Fairtrade Growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094221/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.

However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and [[precompetitive]] industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} .

With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering ''real'' social, environmental and economic results. The [[ISEAL Alliance]] has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.

Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of [[State of Sustainability Initiatives|The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI)]] project, facilitated by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

== Origin of global standards ==

''Most'' sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by [[social movements]] in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as [[UTZ Certified|Utz Certified]] (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including [[Kraft Foods]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[Nestle]], assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1668888 Article on the Development of the Common Code for the Coffee Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.

Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.

== Different sustainability standards ==
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Introduction to different standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.

=== Fairtrade ===

The [[Fairtrade]] label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The initiative performs [[development work]] and promotes its political vision of an [[alternative economy]], seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The ''most distinguishing'' feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a [[social premium]] that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.

=== Rainforest Alliance ===
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}
The [[Rainforest Alliance]] was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers’ welfare by establishing and securing ''sustainable'' livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed [[floor price]], the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Utz Certified ===

[[UTZ Certified]] (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster [[Ahold Coffee Company]] in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. ''Instruments'' include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has ''stringent'' chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).

=== Organic ===
The [[Organic farming|Organic]] standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on [[IFOAM]] Basic Standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== trustea ===

The [http://www.trustea.org trustea code] is designed to evaluate the social, economic, [[agronomic]] and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).

It is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly– producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.

=== SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===

SuRe® is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth&lt;/ref&gt; GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe® standard at a [[COP21]] event on 9 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/updates/gib-launches-sure%C2%AE-standard-cop21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
Other types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as [[GlobalGAP]];
Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as [[Starbucks#Coffee and Farmer Equity .28C.A.F.E..29 practices|Starbucks' CAFE Practices]]; and national programmes such as the [[Bord Bia|Irish Food Board]]'s 'Origin Green' scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Topics/Product-differentiation/Special-report-Implications-of-sustainability-certification-schemes-for-the-ACP ''Agritrade'': Implications of sustainability certification schemes for the ACP] 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards]] (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards|url=https://unfss.org|website=UNFSS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Text Encoding Initiative''' ('''TEI''') is a [[written language|text-centric]] [[community of practice]] in the [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] of [[digital humanities]], operating continuously since the 1980s. The community currently runs a mailing list, meetings and conference series, and maintains an [[eponymous]] [[technical standard]], a [[Scientific journal|journal]], a [[wiki]], a [[GitHub]] repository and a [[toolchain]].

==TEI guidelines==

The ''TEI Guidelines'', which collectively define an XML format, are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known [[open formats]] for text (such as [[HTML]] and [[OpenDocument]]) in that it's primarily semantic rather than presentational; the semantics and interpretation of every tag and attribute are specified.
Some 500 different textual components and concepts
(&lt;tt&gt;word&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element w (word)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;sentence&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-s.html|title=Element s (s-unit)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;character&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-c.html|title=Element c (character)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html|title=Element g (character or glyph)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;person&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-person.html|title=Element person (person)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
etc.); each is grounded in one or more academic discipline and examples are given.

===Technical details===

The standard is split into two parts, a discursive textual description with extended examples and discussion and set of tag-by-tag definitions. Schemata in most of the modern formats ([[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[RELAX NG]] and [[W3C Schema]]) are generated automatically from the tag-by-tag definitions. A number of tools support the production of the guidelines and the application of the guidelines to specific projects.

A number of special tags are used to circumvent restrictions imposed by the underlying [[Unicode]]; &lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt; to allow representation of characters that don't qualify for Unicode inclusion&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; to allow overcome the required strict linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html|title=Element choice  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most users of the format do not use the complete range of tags but produce a customisation, using a project-specific subset of the tags and attributes defined by the Guidelines. The TEI defines a sophisticated customization mechanism known as ODD for this purpose. In addition to documenting and describing each TEI tag, an ODD specification specifies its content model and other usage constraints, which may be expressed using [[schematron]].

''TEI Lite'' is an  example of such a customization. It defines an [[XML]]-based [[file format]] for exchanging texts.  It is a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements available in the full TEI Guidelines.

===Examples===

The text of the TEI guidelines is rich in examples. There is also a samples page on the TEI wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples_of_TEI_texts |title=Samples of TEI texts |work=wiki.tei-c.org |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives examples of real-world projects which expose their underlying TEI.

====Prose tags====

TEI allows texts to be marked up syntactically at any level of granularity, or mixture of granularities. For example, this paragraph (p) has been marked up into sentences (s) and clauses (cl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILCW |title=17 Simple Analytic Mechanisms - TEI P5: — Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;

 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It was about the beginning of September, 1664,
  &lt;cl&gt;that I, among the rest of my neighbours,
       heard in ordinary discourse
   &lt;cl&gt;that the plague was returned again to Holland; &lt;/cl&gt;
   &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;for it had been very violent there, and particularly at
     Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;whither, &lt;cl&gt;they say,&lt;/cl&gt; it was brought,
  &lt;cl&gt;some said&lt;/cl&gt; from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods
  &lt;cl&gt;which were brought home by their Turkey fleet;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;others said it was brought from Candia;
     others from Cyprus. &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It mattered not &lt;cl&gt;from whence it came;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;but all agreed &lt;cl&gt;it was come into Holland again.&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Verse====

TEI has tags for marking up verse. This example (taken from the French translation of the TEI Guidelines) shows a sonnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/fr/html/ref-lg |title=TEI element lg (groupe de vers) |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;div type="sonnet"&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Les amoureux fervents et les savants austères&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Aiment également, dans leur mûre saison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux sédentaires.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Amis de la science et de la volupté&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Ils cherchent le silence et l'horreur des ténèbres ;&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; L'Érèbe les eût pris pour ses coursiers funèbres,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; S'ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fierté.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudes&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Des grands sphinx allongés au fond des solitudes,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Qui semblent s'endormir dans un rêve sans fin ;&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Leurs reins féconds sont pleins d'étincelles magiques,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Et des parcelles d'or, ainsi qu'un sable fin,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Étoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Choice tag====

The &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; tag is used to represent sections of text which might be encoded or tagged in more than one possible way. In the following example, based on one in the standard, &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; is used twice, once to indicate an original and a corrected year and once to indicate an original and regularised spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html |title=TEI element &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ODD==

'''One Document Does it all''' ("ODD") is a [[literate programming]] language for [[XML schema]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Bauman|first1=Syd|last2=Flanders|first2=Julia|contribution=ODD customizations|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Bauman01/EML2004Bauman01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Burnard|first1=Lou|author2-link=Sebastian Rahtz|last2=Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|contribution=RelaxNG with Son of ODD|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Burnard01/EML2004Burnard01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Literate Documentation for XML|last=Reiss|first=Kevin M.|publisher=Digital Humanities 2007|location=Urbana-Champaign, Illinois|year=2007|url=http://dhcommons.tamu.edu/sites/default/files/poster_208_reiss.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A complete schema definition language for the Text Encoding Initiative|first1=Lou|last1=Burnard|author2-link=Sebastian Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|last2=Rahtz|date=June 2013|journal=XML London 2013|doi=10.14337/XMLLondon13.Rahtz01|url=http://xmllondon.com/2013/presentations/rahtz/|pages=152–161|isbn=978-0-9926471-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In literate-programming style, ODD documents combine human-readable documentation and machine-readable models using the  Documentation Elements module of the Text Encoding Initiative. Tools generate [[Internationalization and localization|localised and internationalised]] [[HTML]], [[ePub]], or [[PDF]] human-readable output and [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]s, [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax machine-readable output.

The Roma web application&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/ Roma web application].&lt;/ref&gt; is built around the ODD format and can use it to  generate schemas in [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax formats, as used by many XML validation tools and services.

ODD is the format used internally by the Text Encoding Initiative for their [[eponymous]] [[Technical Standards and Safety Authority|technical standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2007|editor1-first=Lou|editor1-last=Burnard|editor2-first=Syd|editor2-last=Bauman|title=TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange|publisher=TEI Consortium|location=Charlottesville, Virginia, USA|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ODD files generally describe the difference between a customized XML format and the full TEI model, ODD also can be used to describe XML formats that are entirely separate from the TEI.  One example of this is the [[W3C| W3C's]] [[Internationalization Tag Set]] which uses the ODD format to generate schemas and document its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/its/ W3C ITS] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/its/itstagset.xml TEI ODD file].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best Practices for XML Internationalization|editor1-last=Savourel|editor1-first=Yves|editor2-last=Kosek|editor2-first=Jirka|editor3-last=Ishida|editor3-first=Richard|publisher=W3C Working Group|year=2008|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-i18n-bp/|contribution=5.2 ITS and TEI}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEI customizations==

TEI customizations are specializations of the TEI XML specification for use in particular fields or by specific communities.

* [[EpiDoc]] (Epigraphic Documents)
* [http://www.cei.lmu.de/ Charters Encoding Initiative]
* [http://www.menota.org/ Medieval Nordic Text Archive (Menota)]

Customization in the TEI is done through the ODD mechanism mentioned above. In truth since its P5 version, all so-called 'TEI Conformant' uses of the TEI Guidelines are based on a TEI customization documented in a TEI ODD file. Even when users choose one of the off-the-shelf pre-generated schemas to validate against, these have been created from freely available customization files.

==Projects==
The format is used by many projects worldwide. Practically all projects are associated with one or more universities. Some well-known projects that encode texts using TEI include:

==History==
Prior to the creation of TEI, humanities scholars had no common standards for encoding electronic texts in a manner which would serve their academic goals ([[Susan Hockey|Hockey]] 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;41).  In 1987, a group of scholars representing fields in humanities, linguistics, and computing convened at Vassar College to put forth a set of guidelines known as the “Poughkeepsie Principles”. These guidelines directed the development of the first TEI standard, "P1"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahronheim|first=J.R.|title=Descriptive metadata: Emerging standards.|journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship|year=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantara |first=L.|title=The text-encoding initiative: Part 1|journal=OCLC Systems &amp; Services|year=2005|volume=21|issue=1|pages=36–39|doi=10.1108/10650750510578136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1987''' Work on what would become the TEI started by  the  [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ach.org/ ach.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]], and the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Historical background", [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AB.html#ABTEI section iv.2] of TEI P5:  Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange.&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the ''Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/SC/teipcp1.txt |title= Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference |work=tei-c.org |year=2009 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1994''' TEI P3 released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/|title=TEI Guidelines|accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  co-edited by  Lou Burnard (at [[Oxford University]]) and [[Michael Sperberg-McQueen]] (then at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], later at the [[W3C]]).
* '''1999''' TEI P3 updated.
* '''2002''' TEI P4 released, moving from SGML to XML; adoption of [[Unicode]], which XML parsers are required to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=XML Basics|chapter=2|url=http://www.xmlnews.org/docs/xml-basics.html |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2007''' TEI P5 released, including integration with the &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xml:id&lt;/code&gt; attributes from the W3C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)|work=w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (these had previously been attributes in the TEI namespace), regularization of local pointing attributes to use the hash (as used in HTML) and unification of the ptr and xptr tags. Together these changes with many more new additions make P5 more regular and bring it closer to current xml practice as promoted by the [[W3C]] and as used by other XML variants. Maintenance and feature update versions of TEI P5 have been released at least twice a year since 2007.
* '''2011''' TEI P5 v2.0.1 released with support for [[Genetic editing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-2.0.1.html |title=P5 version 2.0.1 release notes |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (among many other additions the [[Genetic editing]] features allow encoding of texts without interpretation as to their specific semantics.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16067">The '''theology of religions''' is the branch of [[theology]] (mostly represented by [[Christian theology|Christian]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Islam]]ic and [[Judaism|Jewish]] theology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bronk |first=Andrzej |title=Podstawy nauk o religii |others=Antoni Fetkowski (ed.) |publisher=Wydawnictwo Towarzystwa Naukowego KUL |location=Lublin |year=1996 |pages=129 |chapter=11. Teologia religii |isbn=83-86668-44-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[religious studies]] that attempts to theologically evaluate the phenomena of religions. Three important schools within Christian part of this field are pluralism, inclusivism, and exclusivism, which describe the relation of other religious traditions to Christianity and attempt to answer questions about the nature of God and salvation.

==Purpose==
The American theologian [[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] argued that the political situation of the West following [[World War II]] set up a need for Christian thinkers to reconsider the place of other religions specifically because of the changing political world:

:Colonies vanished, Europe disappeared as a major power, other non-western power centers appeared representing other ways of life and other religions. The West no longer ruled the world... Western religion became one among the other world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Gilkey, "Plurality and Its Theological Implications", in ''The Myth of Christian Uniqueness: Toward a Pluralistic Theology of Religions'' (edited by [[John Hick]]), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Three-Point Model==
The most common model of the view that one takes of other religions has been viewed in a simple, three point model, first articulated by Alan Race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Race |first=Alan |date=1982 |title= Christians and Religious Pluralism: Patterns in the Christian Theology of Religions |location= Maryknoll, NY|publisher=Orbis Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Pluralism is basically the belief that the world religions are true and equally valid in their communication of the truth about God, the world, and salvation. The chief expounder of this view is [[John Hick]] of [[Claremont Graduate School]] in California, who first propounded it in his book ''God and the Universe of Faiths (1973)''. It has been notably criticized in the declaration [[Dominus Iesus]] by Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]].

This is the popular view that all religions lead to the same God and all ways lead to heaven. According to Hick, Christianity is not the one and only way of salvation, but one among several. To a pluralist such as Hick, Christianity is not the absolute, unique, and final way to God. While pluralists assert the validity of all religions, they also deny the finality of all religions. According to Hick, in the evolutionary scheme of things in which at isolated ages and places the early religions are succeeded by higher religions, it is the same message of God that comes distinctly to a particular group but in a different form from the others. Hick challenges the older view that Christ or Christianity must be seen at the center of religions. Rather, he says, God must be seen at the center of religions. This view is also called theo-centrism. The pluralistic contention is that although religions have different outward forms, all have the same source.

To an evangelical Christian, such pluralism only means the abolition of ''kerygmatic'' mission (i.e., the mission of evangelizing the world with the salvific gospel of Jesus Christ).  Pluralism has been criticized for masquerading as Christianity when in fact it is an invasive force that comes from outside of Christianity and imperialistically demands the surrender of Christian distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Alister E. McGrath, "Conclusion," in ''Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World'', ed. Stanley N. Gundry, Dennis L. Okholm, and Timothy R. Phillips (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1996), 205-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pluralists respond that Christian pluralism is not an invasive force at all, but actually arises from tensions within the Christian tradition, through a process of auto-deconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carroll Smith, "In Defense of a Christian Pluralism," Journal for the Renewal of Religion and Theology 5 (2009), available from http://renewtheology.org/paperCSmith0709.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have pointed out similarities between Hick's theo-centrism and Hindu pluralism as propounded in the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By whatsoever way men worship Me, even so do I accept them; for, in all ways, O Partha, men walk in My path" (IV.11)&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, &lt;em&gt;Theology of Religion: Pluralism, Inclusivism, and Exclusivism&lt;/em&gt;, as cited by Imtitoshi Longkumer in "Issues in Mission and Evangelism in a Pluralistic Context: A New Paradigm Inquiry," &lt;em&gt;NCC Review,&lt;/em&gt; Vol. CXXXVII, No.01, Jan-Feb 2017 (Nagpur: National Council of Churches in India, 2017), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Another common evangelical criticism of pluralism is that the religions of the world are fundamentally and irreconcilably different.  To value them equally requires a devaluation of propositional truth claims.  It is for this reason that pluralism is often treated as a form of self-defeating relativism, though pluralists generally do not accept this label.  According to John Hick, "Religious pluralism is emphatically not a form of relativism."  Hick considers himself a [[Theological critical realism|critical realist]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "Religious Pluralism and Islam," available from http://www.johnhick.org.uk/article11.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusivism===
[[Inclusivism]] is the belief that God is present in non-Christian religions to save adherents through Christ. The inclusivist view has given rise to the concept of the anonymous Christian by which is understood an adherent of a particular religion whom God saves through Christ, but who personally neither knows the Christ of the Bible nor has converted to Biblical Christianity. This position was popularized by the Roman Catholic theologian, [[Karl Rahner]] (b. 1904-d.1984).{{Nonspecific|date=March 2012}}

One important issue that Rahner raises is about the salvation of those who have never had the opportunity to listen to the gospel Jesus Christ. To Rahner, then, people can be saved apart from allegiance to the Christian church. It is God in Christ who reaches out to the individual in his own personal religious history to save him. Rahner used the term ‘anonymous’ to denote people who experience the grace of God in Christ regardless of what religion they belong to. Inclusivism is based on two axioms: the first is that salvation is through Christ alone, the second is that God wills the whole world to be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Acts 4:12 and 1 Timothy 2: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God saves people through Christ alone; however, he makes this possible through ways that extend to all humanity.

To Rahner, a non-Christian religion is a lawful religion for until its followers have a Christian witness it is a means by which non-Christians gain a right relationship with God. Also, the religion is included in God’s plan of salvation which God has ordained for the communication of His grace.

Inclusivism has a great appeal to people because of its sympathetic approach to religion.

===Exclusivism===
Exclusivism is the theological position that holds to the finality of the Christian faith in Christ. The finality of Christ means that there is no salvation in non-Christian religions. Notable among the exclusivists of the twentieth century are [[Samuel Zwemer]], [[Hendrik Kraemer]], and [[Lesslie Newbigin]].

Based on the Aristotelian concept of truth as one and not many, exclusivists regard all other religious claims as false and invalid since the Christian revelation is accepted as true.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Gnanakan, The Pluralistic Predicament (Bangalore: TBT, 1992), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusivists hold that salvation is through Christ alone. It is through a personal experience of commitment to Christ that one receives assurance of salvation. The non-believers cannot receive such assurance since they are neither aware of the uniqueness of Christ neither do they acknowledge His lordship. The exclusivist begins with the Bible as the source of all knowledge about spirituality and salvation. The Bible is the criterion of all religious truth. The Bible relates the history of redemption, gives a foundation to personal faith, is a guidebook of the Christian community, and speaks about the future of the world that links up all history, life, and service with meaning and purpose. Exclusivism, thus, establishes the uniqueness and identity of Christianity among world religions. Such exclusivism can take either an extremist or a moderate viewpoint. The extremist view regards all non-Christian religions as demonic and enemies of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Brunner &amp; Karl Barth, Natural Theology (London: Geoffrey Bles: The Centenary Press, 1946), pp. 74, 128&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the moderate view sees some non-Christian religions as containing elements whereby a dialogue with them can be initiated. However, all exclusivists in general agree that salvation is exclusively only through Christ and received by a personal commitment to the Lord.

An exclusivist view is inevitable in any dialogue of truth. In fact, neither the pluralist nor the inclusivist could avoid being exclusivist at some point. Truth by nature is exclusive and any claim to truth is exclusive. The only way to deny exclusiveness of Christ is to deny the veracity of the Bible. The exclusivist view sees the exclusiveness of the Bible in its proclamation of Christ as the only way of salvation, though the Bible also speaks of God involved in the history of the nations. Thus, though being very vociferous in his attacks on Hinduism, [[Nehemiah Goreh]] could say that ‘Most erroneous as is the teaching of such books as the ''Bhagvadgita,''  the ''Bhagvata'', etc., yet they teach something of ''ananyabhakti'' (undivided devotedness to God), of ''vairagya'' (giving up the world), of ''namrata'' (humility), of ''ksama'' (forbearance), etc., which enables one to appreciate the precepts of Christianity.’&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Proofs of the Divinity of Our Lord, as cited by R.H.S. Boyd in Indian Christian Theology (Delhi: ISPCK, 1969), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrik Kraemer's exclusivism is based on a skepticism towards claims of similarity between religions: "Every religion is an individisble, and not to be divided". Religion "is not a series of tenets, institutions, practices that can be taken one by one as independent items of religious life".&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kraemer, ''The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World'' (1938), p. 40. Cited in {{cite book|author=Tim S. Perry|title=Radical Difference: A Defence of Hendrik Kraemer's Theology of Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FBFtVH_mOwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2001|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-377-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitter's Four-Point Model==
A significant expansion of the three point model was proposed by [[Paul F. Knitter]] in his 2002 book ''Introducing Theologies of Religions''. He outlined four possible views or models that one could adopt.&lt;ref&gt; Introducing Theologies of Religions. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2002. 256 pp. {{ISBN|1-57075-419-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Replacement Model===

This tracks to the third of the three point models, i.e. Exclusivism, but is split into two subsections: Total Replacement and Partial Replacement. The Total Replacement model is most frequently found in [[Fundamentalist Christians|Fundamentalist]]/[[Evangelical]] churches, and largely represents the work of [[Karl Barth]]. It suggests that the reason the Christian religion is considered true is that it realizes that all religion is false (including itself), and recognizes that the only true belief can be found in Jesus. It does not necessarily say that there is nothing of value in other religions, but simply that there is no use in studying other religions, as everything of value can be found in Christ. The Partial Replacement model has similar things to say about other religions, but does not go so far as to say that there is nothing of value in other religions. It suggests that other religions might have access to God's revelation, but not to God's salvation. This is an important distinction, as it implies that some truth can be found in other religions, but not whole of the truth, and not enough to receive salvation. This view is largely based on the views expressed by the [[World Council of Churches]] in their discussion on religious dialogue and theology.

===The Fulfillment Model===

Knitter's main contribution, informed by his Christian faith and the idea that Christianity is a fulfillment of Judaism, implies that, while the previous religion was not wrong, it was incomplete and awaiting later fulfillment. This view is also held by some forms of Islam with respect to Christianity and Judaism before them, as well as by Mormonism and all other faiths who feel they have a later clarification from God.

However, one's religion does not have to be founded after others in order to see one's religion as a fulfillment. For instance, some Christian theologians argue that if their faith *arrives* later than the indigenous religion, even if in history Christianity came first, such indigenous systems were "God's placeholder," often with common truths learned from nature mixed with erroneous revelatory truths, that can be fulfilled and corrected with the revealed truth of the Christian Scriptures.

Proponents of this view include [[Karl Rahner]], whose appreciation of the phrase "all grace is Christ's grace" led him to the controversial theory of "anonymous Christians" - those who are already saved by the light they have, yet have not yet heard the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Knitter, 72, 73. See also, Karl Rahner, “Christianity and the non-Christian Religions,” in Theological Investigations (Baltimore: Helicon Press, 1966) 5:115-134&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mutuality Model===

This model admits that an admixture of truth, error, and incompleteness of revelation exists in all religions, and we need one another to understand and find the truth. While this is a type of pluralism, it does not go so far as to admit that everyone is right, or that there is no objective truth - it only admits that we must learn from one another to find it. It may be that one or another faith is wrong on even major doctrines - but it is also right and has some value in contributing to the whole. 

===The Acceptance Model===
This is Knitter's analog of pure pluralism. All paths may lead to God, and no one can affirm surely that their way is correct. We must all learn from one another, and pull back from making any absolute claims about spiritual matters. As a type of utilitarianism, it takes a subjective approach that admits that various viewpoints may work or not work for the individual, and that is the measure of truth, and any claims beyond that are speculation.

== History ==
Plans for the creation of this public university were first developed at the 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], but when the State of [[California]] was established in 1850, it lacked the funds necessary to create such a school. Missionaries sent west by the [[American Home Missionary Society|Home Mission Society]] of New York, however, created the [[College of California]] and eventually transferred its ownership to the State in 1855.

By 1862, the State had secured the land necessary to establish a college as a result of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act.]] This college was known as the Agricultural Mining and Mechanical Arts College, and opened formally in 1866.

On March 23, 1868, [[Henry Huntly Haight|Governor H.H. Haight]] combined the resources of this college with the College of California to create the first [[University of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/daniel_gilman.html|title=Daniel Coit Gilman and the Early Years of UC - Special Topics - A History of UCSF|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Regents began admitting women to the University of California in 1871, and the first woman to graduate was Rosa L. Scrivner, with a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|PhB]] in Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/graduates00univ/graduates00univ_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Graduates, 1864-1905. November 1905"|website=www.archive.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Cnr campus.png|thumb|Wellman Hall, flanked by Giannini and Hilgard Halls.]]

== Campus ==
[[File:Cnr map.png|thumb|The original College of Agriculture consisted of the Hilgard, Wellman, and Giannini halls. Today, CNR has expanded to occupy the Koshland, Morgan, and Mulford buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/site/forms/pdf/CNR_Report.pdf|title=College of Natural Resources|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=Forms &amp; Petitions|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The College of Natural Resources is located on the northwest end of the UC Berkeley campus, and comprises six main buildings.

These include the historic group of Wellman, Hilgard, and Giannini halls that composed the original college. This trio, known as the Agriculture Complex, is the most unified grouping of buildings on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=William|last2=Knapp|first2=Frederic|date=2012-01-01|title=Hilgard Hall (John Galen Howard) Historic Structures Report|url=https://works.bepress.com/williamriggs/15/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and are visually unified by a Mediterranean landscape of olive and stone pine trees.

The first hall, Wellman, is a Classical Revival building designed in 1912 by [[John Galen Howard]] and named after [[Harry R. Wellman]], a professor of Agricultural Economics, and acting president of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb7t1nb4v2&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00071&amp;toc.id=|title=University of California: In Memoriam, 1997|website=texts.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilgard was constructed six years later by the same architect, and named after [[Eugene W. Hilgard]], professor of Agricultural Chemistry and father of modern soil science. Its neo-classical design is inscribed with the phrase "''To Rescue for Human Society the Native Values of Rural Life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noehill.com/alameda/nat1982004647.asp|title=National Register #82004647: Hilgard Hall on UC Berkeley Campus, California|website=noehill.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giannini Hall was designed by Howard's co-worker, William Charles Hays, through an endowment from the Bancitaly Corporation (now known as [[Bank of America]]) in memory of their founder, [[Amadeo Giannini]].

The '''United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs''' ('''UN DESA''') is part of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] and is responsible for the follow-up to major United Nations Summits and Conferences, as well as services to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and the Second and Third Committees of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="bio2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/ousg/#bioSection| title=About Mr. Wu Hongbo, Under-Secretary-General|accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN DESA assists countries around the world in [[agenda-setting theory|agenda-setting]] and decision-making with the goal of meeting their economic, social and environmental challenges. It supports international cooperation to promote sustainable development for all, having as a foundation the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] ('''SDGs''') as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 2015. In providing a broad range of analytical products, policy advice, and technical assistance, UN DESA effectively translates global commitments in the economic, social and environmental spheres into national policies and actions and continues to play a key role in monitoring progress towards internationally agreed-upon development goals. It is also a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P%3D13 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
UN DESA is part of the UN Secretariat, which is funded through regular assessed contributions from Member States. The Department was reorganized into its present form in 1997. The Department is headed by Liu Zhenmin who assumed the office of Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, following his appointment to this position by Secretary-General António Guterres on 26 July 2017. Mr. Liu advises the Secretary-General on the three pillars of sustainable development—social economic and environmental, and nurtures key partnerships with governments, UN agencies and civil society organizations, including the SDGs. In directing and managing UN DESA, the Under-Secretary-General is supported by the Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development and the Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs.

== Mission ==
UN DESA’s mission is to promote [[sustainable development]] for all, focusing on the most vulnerable. This reflects a fundamental concern for equity and equality in countries large and small, developed and developing. It underscores the need for all stakeholders – governments, UN and other international organizations, civil society and the private sector – to do their part to improve economic and social well-being. This emphasis on equitable participation by all people and nations is what makes the United Nations unique and gives the development agenda its universal legitimacy.

== Function ==
UN DESA’s work programme can be categorized into three areas:

[[File:Sdgdesa.jpg|thumb|550px|frame|right|Adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on 25 September 2015]]

'''Norm-setting''': 
By facilitating major global conferences and summits, as mandated by [[UN Member States]], UN DESA assists countries as they find common ground and take decisive steps forward. Specifically, UN DESA is tasked with supporting deliberations in two major UN charter bodies: the UN General Assembly and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), including ECOSOC’s subsidiary bodies. 
In addition, UN DESA organises and supports consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society. In this regard, UN DESA’s main priorities are promoting progress toward and strengthening accountability in achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, UN DESA is responsible for ensuring civil society engagement with the UN through the ECOSOC bodies.

'''Data and Analysis''':
UN DESA, generates, analyzes and compiles a wide range of official economic, social and environmental data and information on which Member States draw to review common problems and to take stock of policy options. One of the Department’s primary contributions is providing policy research and analysis for governments to use in their deliberations and decision-making&lt;ref name="SDG Indicators Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/| title=DESA's flagship data resources and analytic publications|accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
UN DESA is also the lead “author” Department of the UN Secretariat. The research and analytical work covers a range of economic, social and environmental issues. The Department  produces a host of flagship publications and major intergovernmental reports, which are essential to UN negotiations and global policy decisions. The publications are distributed in print and electronic formats around the world.

'''Capacity-building''':
UN DESA also advises Member States / Governments on implementing the policies and programmes developed at UN conferences back in their home countries. It assists interested Governments in translating policy frameworks developed in UN conferences and summits into programmes at the country level and, through technical assistance, helps build national capacities.

It prepares estimates and projections on matters such as total population, fertility, mortality, migration and urbanisation, which serve as reference for the UN system, many Governments, academics, the media and corporate users throughout the world. The Division is the substantive secretariat of the Commission on Population and Development and therefore monitors the implementation of the Programme of Action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and its follow-up commitments. It produces selected indicators related to the reproductive health targets of the Millennium Development Goals and assists the deliberations of the General Assembly in the area of international migration and development.

'''Division for Inclusive Social Development:'''
The [http://social.un.org/index/ Division for Inclusive Social Development] assists governments and civil society organizations formulate social policies that foster more secure, just, free and harmonious societies. The Division works with development partners to promote the realization of a 'society for all', where all members, including older persons, youth, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and other often-marginalised groups all have equal say and equal participation. It provides the primary support and servicing to the Commission for Social Development, the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Conference of State Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

'''Forum on Forests:'''
The [https://www.un.org/esa/forests/ United Nations Forum on Forests Secretariat] is the DESA focal point on all forest policy issues. It provides substantive support to the biennial sessions of the Forum, prepares technical reports and analytical studies, and fosters dialogue to enhance co-operation and co-ordination on forest issues. It provides a comprehensive and integrated view of forests which encompasses economic, social and environmental aspects. In 2009, the Secretariat was mandated to launch a Facilitative Process to assist countries in mobilizing financing for sustainable forest management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4807">'''Vaginal photoplethysmography''' ('''VPG''', '''VPP''') is a [[photoplethysmogram|technique using light]] to measure the [[vasocongestion|amount of blood]] in the walls of the [[vagina]].  The device that is used is called a vaginal [[photometer]].

==Use==
The device is used to try to obtain an objective measure of a woman's [[sexual arousal]]. There is an overall poor correlation (r = 0.26) between women's self-reported levels of desire and their VPG readings.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010| title = Agreement of Self-Reported and Genital Measures of Sexual Arousal in Men and Women: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 5–56 | pmc=2811244 | pmid=20049519 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9556-9 |vauthors=Chivers ML, Seto MC, Lalumière ML, Laan E, Grimbos T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrument==
The instrument used in the procedure is called vaginal [[photometer]]. The device has a clear shell, inside of which is a light source and a [[photocell]], which senses reflected light.  The use of the device is done with the assumption that the more light that is scattered back, and that the photocell senses, the more blood is in the walls of the vagina.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007/&gt; 

The output of the VPG can be filtered into two types of signals, which have different properties. The [[direct current]] signal is a measure of vaginal blood volume (VBV) and reflects the total blood volume in the [[vagina|vaginal tissues]].&lt;ref name="Hatch"&gt;Hatch, J. P. [“Vaginal photoplethysmography: Methodological considerations”],”Archives of Sexual Behavior, 8, 357–374”, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update inline|date=February 2018}} The [[alternating current]] signal is a measure of vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) and reflects the pressure change within the [[blood vessel]]s of the vaginal wall associated with each heartbeat.&lt;ref name="Hatch" /&gt; While changes in VBV occur in response to sexual and anxiety-inducing stimuli, changes in VPA only occur in response to sexual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Laan, E., Everaerd, W., &amp; Evers, A. [http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/21166/21166.PDF?sequence=1 “Assessment of female sexual arousal: Response specificity and construct validity”], “Psychophysiology, 32, 476–485”, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}} 
 
VPA is defined as the [[amplitude|peak-to-trough amplitude]] of the vaginal pulse wave. It is calculated by subtracting the means of all troughs from the means of all peaks experienced during stimulus presentation.VPA lacks an absolute scale of measurement; each unit of change (mV) does not correspond directly with a physiological change. Since VPA does not have a standard unit of measurement, it is difficult for researchers to make between-participant comparisons.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010/&gt;

==History==
VPG was first introduced in the 1960s by Palti and Berovici, who affixed a light source and photosensitive cell onto a [[speculum (medical)|gynecological speculum]] and recorded vaginal pulse waves.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jannsen|first1=Erick|last2=Prause|first2=Nicole|last3=Geer|first3=James H.|editor1-last=Cacioppo|editor1-first=John T.|editor2-last=Tassinary|editor2-first=Louis G.|editor3-last=Berntson|editor3-first=Gary|title=Handbook of Psychophysiology|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139461931|page=254|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Psychophysiology.html?id=E7hRKwVBXb4C|language=en|chapter=Chapter 11: The Sexual Response}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Molenkamp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molenkamp|first1=Bert|title=SexLab - Equipment &amp; Instruments - Vaginal Photoplethysmography|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/ei-vp-uvaprobe.html|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palti, Y. &amp; Bercovici, B. [“Photoplethysmographic study of the vaginal blood pulse”], “American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, 97, 143–53”, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  Sintchak and Geer improved on the device in the 1970s by using a vaginal probe which became the common instrument to measure vaginal blood flow.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Molenkamp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chivers2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sintchak|first1=G|last2=Geer|first2=JH|title=A vaginal plethysmograph system.|journal=Psychophysiology|date=January 1975|volume=12|issue=1|pages=113-5|pmid=1114202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
