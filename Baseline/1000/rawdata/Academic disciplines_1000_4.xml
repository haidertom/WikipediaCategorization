[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==
In 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash,&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies.&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the {{ill|Einwohnermeldeamt|de}} or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/1500-werke-von-picasso-bis-chagall-zollfahnder-entdecken-sensationellen-kunstschatz-in-muenchen_aid_1147066.html|title=Fahnder entdecken 1500 Werke von Picasso, Chagall und weiteren Künstlern|work=Focus|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24794970|title=Nazi looted art 'found in Munich'|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ_Nov22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-ein-dementi-weitere-meldungen-nuechterne-schaetzungen-12674903.html|title=Schwabinger Kunstfund: Ein Dementi, weitere Meldungen, nüchterne Schätzungen|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;
The paintings recovered included works by &lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Canaletto]], Marc Chagall, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Christoph|de}}, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], Otto Dix, [[Albrecht Dürer]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Fraaß|de}}, [[Conrad Felixmüller]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Ludwig Godenschweg]], [[Otto Griebel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paul Klee]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Kretzschmar|de}}, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wilhelm Lachnit]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Maskos|de}}, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Christoph Voll]].

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A. Böhmer und sein Nachlass.'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-05-004498-9}}. (''Schriften der Forschungsstelle "Entartete Kunst"''),  p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; She stated to ''Focus'' that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970/&gt; At the time of the interview with ''Focus'', she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name=Telg10424957&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10424957/Art-experts-demand-Germany-releases-list-of-1-billion-Nazi-art-trove.html | title=Art experts demand Germany releases list of €1-billion Nazi art trove | work=The Telegraph | date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Alexander, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners.&lt;ref name=BBCSpiegel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24977814|title=Nazi-looted art: German collector says he owns pictures |date=17 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-interview-with-cornelius-gurlitt-about-munich-art-find-a-933953.htm | title=Interview with a Phantom: Cornelius Gurlitt Shares the Secrets of His Pictures | work=Der Spiegel | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Gezer, Õzlem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10439168/Art-dealer-paid-Nazis-just-4000-Swiss-Francs-for-masterpieces.html|title=Art dealer paid Nazis just 4,000 Swiss Francs for masterpieces|last=Barnett |first=Louise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCStuttgart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24910093|title=German police check new art haul near Stuttgart |date=12 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated). "Die eigentumsrechtliche Problematik der ''entarteten'' Kunst" – "The problems surrounding ownership rights to ''degenerate'' art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235653/http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 |date=2 December 2013 }} (bilingual), on the website of the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.  Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gurlitt-collection-arrives-kunstmuseum-bern-1018277| title = The Notorious Gurlitt Trove of Nazi-Tainted Art Makes Its First Appearance at Kunstmuseum Bern| author = Neuendorf, Henri| date = July 10, 2017| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = artmet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme Assise'' to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Max Liebermann's ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector [[David Friedmann]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s ''Playing the Piano'' to the heirs of music publisher [[Henri Hinrichsen]], who was murdered at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30176190 |title=Swiss museum to accept Gurlitt 'Nazi art' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public display of the Gurlitt art trove took place at an exhibition curated by the Bern Fine Art Museum, running from November 2017 to March 2018, which featured 160 works from the controversial Gurlitt art collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/bern-fine-arts-museum_gurlitt-exhibition-attracts-droves-of-visitors/43793524| title = Gurlitt exhibition attracts droves of visitors| date = January 2, 2018| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Academy of Religion (logo).png|thumb]]
The '''American Academy of Religion''' ('''AAR''') is the world's largest association of [[scholar]]s in the [[List of academic disciplines|field]] of [[religious studies]] and related topics.  It is a nonprofit member association, 
serving as a professional and learned society for scholars involved in the academic study of religion. It has some 10,000 members worldwide, with the largest concentration being in the United States and Canada. AAR members are university and college professors, independent scholars, secondary teachers, clergy, seminarians, students, and interested lay-people.

== History ==

AAR was founded in 1909 as the Association of Biblical Instructors in American Colleges and Secondary Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gearon|first1=Liam|title=MasterClass in Religious Education: Transforming Teaching and Learning|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|location=London / New York|isbn=9781441160065|page=40|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/825398792|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed to National Association of Biblical Instructors (NABI) in 1933. The American Academy of Religion was adopted as the organization name in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Elizabeth|title=Founding the Fathers|date=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4319-2|page=8|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794700594|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect its broader, inclusive mission to foster the academic study of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;

Presidents of the AAR have included well-known scholars such as [[Judith Plaskow]], [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [[Wendy Doniger]], [[Emilie Townes]], [[Peter J. Paris]], [[Rebecca Chopp]], and [[Elizabeth A. Clark]].

== Publications ==

[[Oxford University Press]] publishes ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' on behalf of the AAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org
 |title=Journal of the American Academy of Religion
 |work=Oxford University Press Journals website
 |accessdate=2011-04-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Religious Studies News'' is the quarterly newspaper of record for the organization; it transitioned from a print to online-only publication in 2010. AAR published the online book review Reading Religion. AAR publishes five book series through Oxford University Press: Academy; Reflection and Theory in the Study of Religion; Religion, Culture, and Theory; Religion in Translation; and Teaching Religious Studies. AAR presents awards each year to notable books in the study of religion. It offers three categories of Awards for Excellence: Analytical-Descriptive Studies, Historical Studies, and Constructive-Reflective Studies.

== Annual meeting ==

AAR hosts an Annual Meeting each year in November. The AAR Annual Meeting is the world's largest meeting for religious studies scholars. Over 400 events, including meetings, receptions, and academic sessions, occur on the AAR program alone; hundreds more, hosted by affiliated societies and institutions, occur over the course of the meeting. Some 10,000 people attend the AAR Annual Meeting; the location of the meeting changes each year. The AAR Annual Meeting program is developed entirely by volunteers involved in program units representing disciplines and sub-disciplines within the field.

== Other activities ==

AAR offers activities on a regional level for its members. Professional development resources such as research grants, career services, and scholarships are some of the member benefits. AAR also advocates the importance of the critical study of religion on institutional and national levels.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}
'''Analytical jurisprudence''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] that draws on the resources of modern [[analytical philosophy]] to try to understand the nature of law. Since the boundaries of analytical philosophy are somewhat vague, it is difficult to say how far it extends.  [[H. L. A. Hart]] was probably the most influential writer in the modern school of analytical jurisprudence,&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, Edgar, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7496&amp;context=penn_law_review Modern Analytical Jurisprudence and the Limits of Its Usefulness], [[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; though its history goes back at least to [[Jeremy Bentham]].

Analytical jurisprudence is not to be mistaken for [[legal formalism]] (the idea that legal reasoning is or can be modelled as a mechanical, algorithmic process). Indeed, it was the analytical jurists who first pointed out that legal formalism is fundamentally mistaken as a theory of law.

Analytic, or 'clarificatory' jurisprudence uses a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected [[natural law]]'s fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' that people invariably slip between describing that the world is a certain way to saying therefore we ought to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ought to do something merely because something is the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world is, must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative [[is–ought problem|ought questions]].

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "[[Definition of law|What are laws]]?"; "What is the law?"; "What is the relationship between law and [[power (social and political)|power]]?"; and, "What is the relationship between law and [[morality]]?" [[Legal positivism]] is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics, who offer their own interpretations.

[[Springer books]] commissioned essays on analytical jurisprudence for ''A Treatise on Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence''. {{ISBN|9781402033872}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5509">'''Categories for the Description of Works of Art''' ('''CDWA''') describes the content of art databases by articulating a conceptual framework for describing and accessing information about works of art, architecture, other material culture, groups and collections of works, and related images. The CDWA includes 532 categories and subcategories. A small subset of categories are considered core in that they represent the minimum information necessary to identify and describe a work. The CDWA includes discussions, basic guidelines for cataloging, and examples. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/introduction.html CDWA Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Categories provide a framework to which existing art information systems can be mapped and upon which new systems can be developed. In addition, the discussions in the CDWA identify vocabulary resources and descriptive practices that will make information residing in diverse systems both more compatible and more accessible. 

The use of the CDWA framework will contribute to the integrity and longevity of data and will facilitate its inevitable migration to new systems as informational technology continues to evolve. Above all, it will help to give end-users consistent, reliable access to information, regardless of the system in which it resides. 

These guidelines hopefully provide a common ground for reaching agreement on what information should be included in art information systems, and what information will be shared or exchanged with other institutions or systems. Target users are curators, registrars, researchers, information managers, and systems vendors.

==History==
The CDWA is a product of the Art Information Task Force (AITF), which encouraged dialog between art historians, art information professionals, and information providers so that together they could develop guidelines for describing works of art, architecture, groups of objects, and visual and textual surrogates. 

Formed in the early 1990s, the task force was made up of representatives from the communities that provide and use art information: art historians, museum curators and registrars, visual resource professionals, art librarians, information managers, and technical specialists. The work of the AITF was funded by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], with a two-year matching grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) to the [[College Art Association]] (CAA).

==CDWA Lite== &lt;!-- [[Lightweight Information Describing Objects]] redirects here --&gt;
[[ARTstor]], the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], and RLG Programs/[[OCLC]] have worked together to develop an XML schema to describe cultural materials and their surrogates to provide an easier and more sustainable model for contributing to union resources. This initiative was driven by the absence of a data content standard specifically designed for unique cultural works, and a technical format for expressing this data in a machine-readable format.

CDWA Lite is an XML schema to describe core records for works of art and material culture based on CDWA and the Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) content standard. CDWA Lite records are intended for contribution to union catalogs and other repositories using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) harvesting protocol. The CDWA Lite schema has been enlarged and integrated into the [[LIDO|Lightweight Information Describing Objects (LIDO)]] schema, which is available on the CIDOC site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA)|url=https://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the music context, the term '''chroma feature''' or '''chromagram''' closely relates to the twelve different [[pitch classes]]. Chroma-based features, which are also referred to [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]], are a powerful tool for analyzing music whose pitches can be meaningfully categorized (often into twelve categories) and whose tuning approximates to the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]]. One main property of chroma features is that they capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation.

==Definition==

The underyling observation is that humans perceive two musical pitches as similar in color if they differ by an octave. Based on this observation, a pitch can be separated into two components, which are referred to as ''tone height'' and ''chroma''.&lt;ref name=Shepard64_pitch_ASA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]], one considers twelve chroma values represented by the set

:{C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E ,F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}, A, A{{music|#}}, B}

that consists of the twelve pitch spelling attributes as used in Western music notation. Note that in the equal-tempered scale different pitch spellings such
C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} refer to the same chroma. Enumerating the chroma values, one can identify the set of chroma values with the set of integers {1,2,...,12}, where 1 refers to chroma C, 2 to C{{music|#}}, and so on. A [[pitch class]] is defined as the set of all pitches that share the same chroma. For example, using the [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class corresponding to the chroma C is the set

:{..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...}

consisting of all pitches separated by an integer number of octaves. Given a music representation (e.g. a musical score or an audio recording), the  main idea of chroma features is to aggregate for a given local time window (e.g. specified in beats or in seconds) all information that relates to a given chroma into a single coefficient. Shifting the time window across the music representation results in a sequence of chroma features each expressing how the representation's pitch content within the time window is spread over the twelve chroma bands. The resulting time-chroma representation is also referred to as [[chromagram]]. The figure above shows chromagrams for a C-major scale, once obtained from a musical score and once from an audio recording. Because of the close relation between the terms chroma and pitch class, chroma features are also referred to as [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]].

==Applications==
Identifying pitches that differ by an octave, chroma features show a high degree of robustness to variations in timbre and closely correlate to the musical aspect of harmony. This is the reason why chroma features are a well-established tool for processing and analyzing music data.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_FundamentalsMusicProcessig_SPRINGER&gt;

==Computation of audio chromagrams==
There are many ways for converting an audio recording into a chromagram. For example, the conversion of an audio recording into a chroma representation (or chromagram) may be performed either by using short-time Fourier transforms in combination with binning strategies&lt;ref name=BartschW05_chroma_IEEEMULTIMEDIA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or by employing suitable multirate filter banks.&lt;ref name=MuellerKC05_ChromaFeatures_ISMIR/&gt;
Furthermore, the properties of chroma features can be significantly changed by
introducing suitable pre- and post-processing steps modifying spectral, temporal,
and dynamical aspects. This leads to a large number of chroma variants, which
may show a quite different behavior in the context of a specific music analysis scenario.&lt;ref name=MuellerE11_ChromaToolbox_ISMIR&gt;

Retrieved December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As a specialty for medical doctors, Clinical Physiology is a diagnostic specialty to which patients are referred to undergo specialized tests of functions of the [[heart]], [[blood vessels]], [[lungs]], [[kidneys]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]], and other organs. Testing methods include evaluation of electrical activity (e.g. [[electrocardiogram]] of the heart), [[blood pressure]] (e.g. [[ankle brachial pressure index]]), and air flow (e.g. [[pulmonary function testing]] using [[spirometry]]). In addition, Clinical Physiologists measure movements, [[velocities]], and [[metabolism|metabolic processes]] through imaging techniques such as [[ultrasound]], [[echocardiography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[x-ray computed tomography]] (CT), and [[nuclear medicine]] scanners (e.g. [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) with and without CT).

== Role ==
[[Human physiology]] is the study of bodily functions. Clinical physiology examinations typically involve assessment of such functions as opposed to assessment of structures and [[anatomy]]. The specialty encompasses the development of new physiological tests for medical diagnostics, while some Clinical Physiology departments perform tests from related medical specialties including [[nuclear medicine]], [[clinical neurophysiology]], and [[radiology]]. In the health care systems of countries that lack this specialty, the tests performed in clinical physiology are often performed by the various organ-specific specialties in [[internal medicine]], such as [[cardiology]], [[pulmonology]], [[nephrology]], and others.

In Australia and the United Kingdom, clinical physiology is not a medical specialty for physicians. Rather, clinical physiologist is a term used in these systems to refer to an allied health professional, scientist, or technologist who may work as a cardiac scientist, vascular scientist, respiratory scientist, sleep scientist or in Ophthalmic and Vision Science as an Ophthalmic Science Practitioner (UK).&lt;ref name=clinicalphysiology /&gt; These professionals also aid in the diagnosis of disease and manage patients, with an emphasis on understanding physiological and pathophysiological pathways.&lt;ref name=clinicalphysiology /&gt; Disciplines within clinical physiology field include [[Audiology|audiologists]], cardiac physiologists, gastro-intestinal physiologists, [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiologists]], [[respiratory physiologist]]s, and sleep physiologists.

== History ==
Clinical physiology was first established in 1954 by the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] with the intention of ensuring "contact between routine clinical work and the scientific progression."  Clinical physiology was originally its own [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]], however, between 2008-2015, clinical physiology was categorized as a sub-discipline to [[radiology]]. For this reason, those pursuing a career in clinical physiology had to first become registered and certified [[radiologists]] before becoming clinical physiologists. Since 2015, it is once again possible to train to be a clinical physiologist, with clinical physiology being its own [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] independent of [[radiology]].

'''Closed-loop communication''' is a [[communication]] technique used to avoid misunderstandings. When the sender gives a message, the receiver repeats this back. The sender then confirms the message; thereby common is using the word “''yes''”. When the receiver incorrectly repeats the message back, the sender will say “negative” (or something similar) and then repeat the correct message. If the sender (person giving the message) does not get a reply back, she must repeat it until the receiver starts closing the loop. To get the attention of the receiver, the sender can use the receiver's name or functional position, touch his or her shoulder, etc.

This means that they not only shape religious beliefs, but they are determinants of how successfully cultural beliefs are transmitted.

Furthermore, cognition and behavior are inextricably linked,&lt;ref name="neisser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neisser|first1=Ulric|title=Cognitive psychology.|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0131396678}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the consequences of cultural concepts are associated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., continued interactions with the environment).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For religion, behaviors often take the form of [[ritual]]s and are similarly executed as a consequence of beliefs.

== Religious cognition ==
Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H. Clark|last2=Kurzban|first2=Robert|title=Modularity in Cognition: Framing the Debate|journal=Psychological Review|date=2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=628–647|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.3.628|pmid=16802884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry A.|title=The modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-262-56025-9|edition=3. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most claim that a capacity for religious thoughts is not a modular adaptation itself, but an evolutionary byproduct of multiple integrated mechanisms that arose independently and are designed for different functions. These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include [[theory of mind]], [[Essentialism|essential psychology]] and the [[hyperactive agency detection device]].&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt; Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atran|first1=Scott|last2=Henrich|first2=Joseph|title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions|journal=Biological Theory|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=04|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=026252225X|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt;

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D. M.|title=Blaming God for Our Pain: Human Suffering and the Divine Mind|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=19 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1177/1088868309350299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin L.|title=Why would anyone believe in God?|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759106673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262540533|edition=1st MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich" /&gt; For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.&lt;ref name="purzinpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know?

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.&lt;ref name="norenbiggods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.&lt;ref name="botero" /&gt; This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norenbiggods" /&gt;

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4|pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reciprocal altruism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=March 1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indirect reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leimar|first1=O|last2=Hammerstein|first2=P|title=Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 April 2001|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=745–53|pmid=11321064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1573|pmc=1088665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=Martin A.|last2=Sigmund|first2=Karl|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring|journal=Nature|date=11 June 1998|volume=393|issue=6685|pages=573–577|doi=10.1038/31225|pmid=9634232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Competitive altruism|competitive helping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|title=Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2011|volume=281|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.023|pmid=21550351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|title=Culture and the evolution of human cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=5 October 2009|volume=364|issue=1533|pages=3281–3288|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.&lt;ref name="mathew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.&lt;ref name="purz12" /&gt;

[[Morality and religion|Religious rules addressing moral behavior]] are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]].&lt;ref name="norenetalpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt; Examples of sharing behaviors in [[Experimental economics|experimental economic games]] played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xygalatas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Klocová|first2=Eva Kundtová|last3=Cigán|first3=Jakub|last4=Kundt|first4=Radek|last5=Maňo|first5=Peter|last6=Kotherová|first6=Silvie|last7=Mitkidis|first7=Panagiotis|last8=Wallot|first8=Sebastian|last9=Kanovsky|first9=Martin|title=Location, Location, Location: Effects of Cross-Religious Primes on Prosocial Behavior|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=9 November 2015|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10508619.2015.1097287|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shariff|first1=A.

When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corelig16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|last2=Apicella|first2=Coren|last3=Atkinson|first3=Quentin D.|last4=Cohen|first4=Emma|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita Anne|last6=Willard|first6=Aiyana K.|last7=Xygalatas|first7=Dimitris|last8=Norenzayan|first8=Ara|last9=Henrich|first9=Joseph|title=Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2016|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=327–330|doi=10.1038/nature16980|pmid=26863190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,&lt;ref name="purz11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan                            and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt; More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

=== Resource management ===
Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, &amp; witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679724680|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=R. B.|last2=Tayor|first2=N.|last3=Codding|first3=B. F.|last4=Bird|first4=D. W.|title=Niche construction and Dreaming logic: aboriginal patch mosaic burning and varanid lizards (Varanus gouldii) in Australia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=23 October 2013|volume=280|issue=1772|pages=20132297–20132297|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2297|pmc=3813344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.&lt;ref name="purz11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13" /&gt; More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;

'''Lobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf''' (18 January 1815 &amp;ndash; 7 December 1874) was a world-leading [[biblical]] scholar in his time. In 1844{{citation needed|reason=should be 1859, see text below|date=February 2017}} he discovered the world's oldest and most complete Bible dating from 325{{citation needed|reason=the exact date is unknown, 330 to 350 would be acceptable|date=February 2017}}, with the complete New Testament not discovered before. This Bible is called [[Codex Sinaiticus]], after the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery|St. Catherine's Monastery]] at [[Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]], where Tischendorf discovered it.  The codex can be seen either in the [[British Library]] in London, or as a digitalised version on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codex Sinaitius|url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213856/http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/|archivedate=2014-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual disputes are resolved when the two oldest books, Codex Sinaiticus (source aleph, 4th AD) and [[Codex Vaticanus]] (source beta, 4th  AD), agree with each other. Tischendorf was made an Honorary Doctor by Oxford University on 16 March 1865, and an Honorary Doctor by Cambridge University on 9 March 1865 following this find of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böttrich|first1=Christfried|title=Bibliographie Konstantin von Tischendorf (1815-1874)|date=1999|publisher=Universitätsverlag, Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student gaining his academic degree in the 1840s, he earned international recognition when he deciphered the ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', a 5th-century [[Greek language|Greek]] [[biblical manuscript|manuscript]] of the [[New Testament]]. 
'''

== The Codex Sinaiticus ==

The ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' contains a 4th-century manuscript of New Testament texts. Two other Bibles of similar age exist, though they are less complete: [[Codex Vaticanus]] in the [[Vatican Library]] and  [[Codex Alexandrinus]], currently owned by the British Library. The Codex Sinaiticus is deemed by some{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be the most authoritative surviving New Testament manuscript, as no older document is as complete as the Codex.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csntm.org/manuscript/View/GA_01&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the "oldest Bible of the world"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} (as it is more complete than [[Codex Alexandrinus]] or [[Codex Vaticanus]]) has been digitised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213856/http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/ Codex Sinaiticus. Experience the oldest Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tischendorf's motivation ==

Throughout his life Tischendorf sought old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament which was based on the oldest possible scriptures. He intended to be as close as possible to the original sources. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).

In 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition, to enable all scholars to have access to the Codex.

Tischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Christfried Böttrich]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tischendorf was born in [[Lengenfeld]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], near [[Plauen]], the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the [[University of Leipzig]] where he was mainly influenced by [[Georg Benedikt Winer|JGB Winer]], and he began to take special interest in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism|criticism]]. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Panning, Armin J. [http://www.wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf Home Tischendorf and the History of the Greek New Testament Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095538/http://wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf |date=2010-11-30 }}, Milwaukee: Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then became master at a school near [[Leipzig]].

After a journey through southern Germany and [[Switzerland]], and a visit to [[Strassburg]], he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the [[recension]]s of the New Testament text — the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars — [[Elsevier]], [[Georg Christian Knapp]], [[Johann Martin Augustin Scholz]], and as recent as [[Karl Lachmann]] — whereby his researches were emboldened to depart from the [[received text]] as used in churches.

These early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact [[collation]]s of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, [[Firmin Didot]], several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the [[Vulgate]]. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.&lt;ref name = "Bible Researcher"&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/bib-t.html Bible Researcher].&lt;/ref&gt;

A great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the [[palimpsest]] ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus|Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus]]'', of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the [[Old Testament]] in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became ''professor extraordinarius'' at Leipzig, and where he was married in 1845. He also began to publish ''Reise in den Orient'', an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845–46, translated as ''Travels in the East'' in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the "Archimedes Palimpsest", which he donated to Cambridge.

From Paris, he had paid short visits to the [[Netherlands]] (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to [[Egypt]], [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]], and the [[Levant]], returning via [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].

=== Discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus Bible manuscripts ===

In 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]] in Egypt, where he found the oldest complete known Bible. Of the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] (reigned 1836-1854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischenforf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at [[Leipzig University]], also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put 2 of the leaves on display in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tischendorf- Search for the oldest Bible of the world|url= http://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de/tischendorf/home.html|publisher=University Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Kholodiuk|first1= Anatoly|title= Tischendorf in search of the oldest Bible of the world - Leibzig Exhibition 2011|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|website=pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|publisher=Pravoslavie|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tischendorf reported in his 1865 book ''Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst'', translated to English in 1866 as  ''When Were Our Gospels Written'' in the section "The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the [[Leipzig University Library|University of Leipzig]], under the title of the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus|Codex Friderico-Augustanus]]'', a name given in honour of his patron, [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]], king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.

Many have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames. [[J. Rendel Harris]] referred to the story as a ''myth''.&lt;ref&gt;"What a run this myth has had, of a convent stove fed with parchment! unhappily for the statement, the basket is still there, a regular part of the library furniture, and not a suggestion can be found that it was ever used to carry vellum books to the kitchen for burning. But any story will be believed against the Sinaitic monks, even that they made fires with parchment." [https://books.google.com/books?id=u6gQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 Dr Gregory and the Canon and Text of the New Testament, ''Expositor'', 1908, p. 140]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. 
In 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the ''Codex Frederico-Augustanus'' or similar ancient Biblical texts. On February 4, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant — the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' — a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.

Tischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]], at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those{{who|date=November 2014}} ignorant of the details of his discovery of the ''Codex Sinaiticus'' accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant [[monastery]] librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a "Schenkungsurkunde". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the [[National Library of Russia|National Russian Library]] the existence cannot be disputed in earnest.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlr.ru/eng/exib/CodexSinaiticus/zah/|title=A.V. Zakharova. The History of the Acquisition of the Sinai Bible by the Russian Government in the Context of Recent Findings in Russian Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 the Tsar awarded Tischendorf the style of "von" Tischendorf as a Russian noble. 327 facsimile editions of the Codex were printed in Leipzig for the Tsar (instead of a salary for the three-year work of Tischendorf the Tsar gave him 100 copies for reselling) in order to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the traditional foundation of the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] state in 862 with the publication of this most amazing find. Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"/&gt;

When the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Tsar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the [[British Museum]] in London, England. The official certificate with signatures in Russian/ French/ Greek sections has been refound in St Petersburg.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"/&gt;

=== Novum Testamentum Graece - publication with 21 editions ===

In the winter of 1849 the first edition of his great work now titled ''Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit. Apparatum criticum multis modis'' appeared (translated as ''Greek New Testament. The ancient witnesses reviewed. Preparations critical in many ways''), containing [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Basic rule: "The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and [[Fathers of the Church|fathers]]."
#"A reading altogether peculiar to one or another ancient document is suspicious; as also is any, even if supported by a class of documents, which seems to evince that it has originated in the revision of a learned man."
#"Readings, however well supported by evidence, are to be rejected, when it is manifest (or very probable) that they have proceeded from the errors of copyists."
#"In parallel passages, whether of the New or Old Testament, especially in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], which ancient copyists continually brought into increased accordance, those testimonies are preferable, in which precise accordance of such parallel passages is not found; unless, indeed, there are important reasons to the contrary."
#"In discrepant readings, that should be preferred which may have given occasion to the rest, or which appears to comprise the elements of the others."
#"Those readings must be maintained which accord with [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]], or with the particular style of each individual writer."&lt;ref name = "Bible Researcher" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, "to clear up in this way," he wrote, "the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine [[Twelve apostles|apostolic]] text which is the foundation of our faith."

In 1850 appeared his edition of the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' (in 1854 corrected)&lt;ref&gt;Constantinus Tischendorf, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&amp;id=x0opAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=NOVUM_TESTAMENTUM_LATINE#v= ''Codex Amiatinus. Novum Testamentum Latine interpreter Hieronymo''], (Lipsiae 1854).&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Septuagint]] version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the ''[[Codex Claromontanus]]''.

Meanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made ''professor ordinarius'' of theology and of Biblical [[paleography]], this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, ''Aus dem heiligen Lande'', appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.

Besides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both [[Robert Schumann]], with whom he corresponded, and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]] wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the [[University of Glasgow]],&lt;ref name = "Univ Glasgow"&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/collection/tischendorf.html Tischendorf] at the [[University of Glasgow]], Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.

He died in [[Leipzig]].

His ''magnum opus'' was the "Critical Edition of the New Testament."

The great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself ''editio viii''; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from [[stereotype]] plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869–72 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]].

Of relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the ''[[Codex Ephraemi]]'', and the ''Friderico-Augustanus'', was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of [[Eberhard Nestle]]'s appendix to the 6th issue (1880).

Besides this may be mentioned editions of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], ''De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu'' (1851); ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' (1851); ''Evangelia apocrypha'' (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); ''Apocalypses apocryphae'' (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as ''Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?'' (''When Were Our Gospels Written?''; 1865; 4th ed., 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), ''Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?'' (1873), and ''Synopsis evangelica'' (7th ed., 1898).

'''Cultural depictions of dogs''' extend back thousands of years to when [[dog]]s were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs in art became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As dogs became more domesticated, they were shown as companion animals, often painted sitting on a lady's lap. Throughout the [[art history]] there is an overwhelming presence of dogs as status symbols and pets in painting mainly in the [[Western art]].  The dogs were brought to houses and were allowed to live in the house and cherished as part of the family, and were regarded as mostly in the upper classes who used them for hunting and could afford to feed them. Hunting dogs were generally connected to the aristocracy. Only the nobility were allowed to keep hunting dogs, and this would signal status, and it was the signalment of a noble man. Dog portraits became increasingly popular in the 18th century, and the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', which further encouraged the popularity of dog portraiture.

The walls of caves and tombs dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] have illustrations or statues of dogs. These generally portray dogs used for hunting, and even children's toys and ceramics depicting dogs.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-15457|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the prehistoric paintings are found in [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]], these paintings depict dog on a [[leash]] with a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Animals of India|page=101|first=Nanditha|last=Krishna|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock art of [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] also include depiction of dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost History of the Canine Race: Our 15,000-year Love Affair with Dogs|first=Mary Elizabeth|last=Thurston|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enduring Treasures: National Parks of the World|publisher=National Geographic Society|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Ancient Greeks and Romans, contrary to the Semitic cultures  favored dogs as pets, and valued them for their faithfulness and courage and were often seen on Greek and Roman reliefs and ceramics as symbols of fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CJ/44/4/Household_Pets*.html|title=Greek and Roman Household Pets |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats were not favoured over dogs, on contrary Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't keep cats as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyforkids.net/greek-pets.html|title=Greek pets|publisher=historyforkids.net|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were given as gifts among lovers and kept them as both  pets, status symbols or kept for guardians and as hunting dogs. Dogs were appreciated by the Greek for their faith and love. [[Homeros]] [[Odyssey]] tells the story of [[Odysseus]] who had a dog called Argos he raised and who was the only one that recognized him when he returned  home after his travels, disguised to conceals his appearance. Only the old dog recognized him instantly. This theme has been often depicted in on ancient Greek vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/53-3/kitchell.pdf|title=Pets of Ancient Greeks|publisher=www.penn.museum|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans kept three types of dogs. Hunting dogs; especially [[sighthound]]s, Molossus type of dogs like the [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]  were often depicted in  reliefs and mosaics with the words Cave Canem; and small companion dogs of [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] type as women's [[lap dog]]s. Greyhounds were often depicted too, often as sculptures. Large dogs were often used in war by the Roman army  in attack formations or for wolf-hunting on horseback,  which was a popular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societasviaromana.net/Collegium_VitaQuotidiana/pets.php|title=Pets in Ancient Rome

[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|Jan van Eyck's ''The Arnolfini Wedding'' (1434).]]
Generally, dogs symbolize [[faith]] and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Hall1979"&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first=James|title=Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLjd0fyT0_IC|year=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-430100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of [[fidelity]] personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. If the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall1979" /&gt;

An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''. An oil painting on [[oak]] [[Panel painting|panel]] dated 1434 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Jan van Eyck]], it is a small full-length double portrait,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] published an article entitled ''Jan van Eyck's 'Arnolfini' Portrait'' in the ''[[Burlington Magazine]] 1934&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to represent the Italian merchant [[Giovanni Arnolfini|Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini]] and his wife,&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad Cothren&lt;/ref&gt; presumably in their home in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Bruges]]. It portrays a wedding scene, where the people invited to witness the ceremony can be seen in the convex mirror at the back, the mirror symbolizing the eye of God. In those times people were not always married in the church, it was enough that two witnesses were present to make a wedding legal. A number of symbols can be found in the picture: the fruit, the symbol of fertility and wealth, the shoes removed (this is a holy place), and the dog. The oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini. The little dog symbolizes in the Middle Ages [[iconography]]  faithfulness, devotion or [[loyalty]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  or can be seen as an emblem of [[lust]], signifying the couple's desire to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jan Van Eyck: The Play of Realism|pages=20–50|first=Craig|last=Harbison|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the couple, the dog looks out to meet the gaze of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}} pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;  The dog could also be simply a lap dog, a gift from husband to wife. Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions. In that case the dog could reflect wealth or social status.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, "Sexuality and social standing in Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini double portrait", ''Renaissance Quarterly'', volume 43, issue 2, p. 270, Summer 1990, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2862365 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting scenes===
[[File:Livre de Chasse 40v.jpg|thumb|left|''Livre de Chasse'', French hunting dog book]]

Hunting scenes were common topics in medieval and Renaissance art. Hunting in the medieval period was a sport exclusive to the aristocracy and hunting was an essential part of court etiquette. Depictions of person together with a hunting dog, hawks or falcons would signal status, or was the signalment of a noble man - since the hunting dogs were  connected to aristocracy, and only the nobility was hunting. Hunting was considered as a sport, but also a way of showing bravery, chivalric virtue while hunting dangerous prey such as wild boars and bears. Hunting dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs were used for different types of hunting. Hunting with dogs was so popular that during the Middle Ages the wild bears had already been hunted to extinction in England.
[[File:ST. Eustachius.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pisanello]] (1395–1455), hunting scene with dogs (''The Vision of St. Eustachius'')]]
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply. Hunting filled also a practical necessity, assuring food for the tables of the nobility. Nobles spending their money on packs of specially bred hounds were not unusual.

[[Gaston III, Count of Foix|Gaston Phoebus]] (30 April 1331 – 1391) wrote a manual on hunting and there are several tapestries from the period which depict hunting scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval and renaissance hunting|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/med-ren-hunting/|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if nobility was hunting, hunting has been forbidden to servants, peasants and also the Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting. Thus, hunting dogs are seldom seen depicted in the company of [[cleric]]s, but very often in the company of in the highest social class of that society.

=== In heraldry===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|thumb|150px|left|Coats of arms of the [[House of Tudor]]]]
[[File:Coa Hungary Town Ebes.svg|thumb|120px|Coats of arms of the Hungarian town [[Ebes]]]]

For the same reason, depictions of dogs can be found in heraldry. In monarchies, the aristocracy are a class of people  who either possess hereditary titles granted by a monarch or are related to such people, and thanks to the specific connection of the aristocrats with the hunting dogs, dogs were often shown as symbols in heraldry. In the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], [[heraldry]] became a highly developed discipline. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] and [[supporter]]s in many [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], and often symbolise courage, vigilance, loyalty and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304224608/http://www.scottish-wedding-dreams.com/heraldic-animals.html ~ Heraldry Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[encaustic tile]]s dating from the 15th century featured a white hound, the Talbot family crest and the inscription "Sir John Talbot" (the [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]). Part of a set of four, the tiles were possibly originally used on a church floor. The term talbot is used in heraldry to refer to a good-mannered hunting dog. The [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot dog]] always depicts the Talbot [[coat of arms]] and is the original hound used as an English heraldic symbol. It is portrayed in the family arms of several noble German families and at least seven other English families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waters |first=Nick |title=History of the Talbot tiles |url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-(2) |accessdate=18 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Dog World (newspaper)|Dog World]] |date=5 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MiPuGlGR?url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-%282%29 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th century==
[[File:Ofthedogingeneral.jpg|thumb|150px|A woodcut illustration from ''The history of four-footed beasts and serpents'' by [[Edward Topsell]], 1658]]
During the 16th and 17th century, dogs were depicted in hunting scenes, or depicted representing social status, as a lap dog, or sometimes as a personal friend. They may also used as symbols in painting. The Greek philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] (404-323 BC) was  depicted by Jean-Léon Gérôme, in the company of dogs that also served as emblems of his "Cynic" (Greek: "kynikos," dog-like) philosophy, which emphasized an austere existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare's Clown: Actor and Text in the Elizabethan Playhouse|page=155|first=David|last=Wiles|publisher=Cambridge university press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Plato, ''Republic'' Book II&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes stated that  "Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosopher is seated in his [[abode]], the earthenware tub, - also depicted sometimes in sitting in a [[barrel]], -  in the [[Metroon]], Athens, lighting the lamp in daylight with which he was to go in searching for an honest man.

Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh portrayed probably a scholar noted by its significance to its particular profession,  depicting a book, or a Protestant preacher and theologian with the Bible opened on the table. A dog depicted as a companion to the scholar is a symbol of [[fidelity]], vigilance and regularity in the research due to assigned to dogs natural intelligence and intuition, and the [[parrot]] is a symbol of erudition and [[eloquence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/rudeness.htm "Logical Rudeness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==

[[File:Izumiya Tomotada - Netsuke in the Form of a Dog - Walters 711020 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Netsuke]] in the Form of a Dog'']]
Netsuke are Japanese miniature sculptures of great artistic merit that were also serving a practical function as a storage place for kimomos that traditionally had no pockets. These small boxes had a carved, button-like toggle called a ''netsuke''. Most netsuke production was during around 1615&amp;ndash;1868, in the [[Edo period]] in Japan. Among others motifs, netsukes depicted even dogs. 
The tradition of showing dogs in hunting scenes continued through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Secord"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian England|url=http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|publisher=William Secord Gallery|accessdate=24 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113235416/http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture entitled ''A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society'' depicts a dog that was well known in London at that time.  The dog depicted by Sir Edwin Landseer 1838, was a Newfoundland called "Bob", who was found in a shipwreck off the coast of England. The dog found his way to the London waterfront, where he became known for saving people from drowning, a total of twenty-three times over the course of fourteen years.

By the Victorian era, the mainly sporting tradition remained but after the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', dog portraits soared in popularity.&lt;ref name="Secord" /&gt; There were differences between the British and European style of depiction; William Secord, a world expert on canine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art  A Muse to Artists and a Delight to Countless Viewers|url=http://www.ralphlaurenhome.com/design/art_gallery_guide/william_secord.aspx|publisher=Ralph Lauren Media|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; described it by stating: "Belgian, Dutch, Flemish and German artists were more influenced by realism, depicting the dog the way it really looked, with dirt on it’s coat and slobber and that kind of thing. You see Alfred Stevens, who's Belgian, do street dogs and dogs that are suffering, which in England you never see. British depictions were more idealized.

The prices achieved for canine art increased the 1980s–90s and started to gain popularity in established art circles rather than antique markets. Buyers can generally be divided into three dominant categories: hunters; breeders and exhibitors of pedigree dogs; and owners of companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silberman|first=Vanessa|title=Who Let the Dogs Out?|journal=Art Business News|date=May 2001|volume=28|issue=5|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-74628439/who-let-the-dogs-out|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

'''Ecotechnology''' - not to be confused with [[ecotechnics]] - is an [[applied science]] that seeks to fulfill [[human]] needs while causing minimal ecological disrupution, by harnessing and manipulating natural forces to leverage their beneficial effects. Ecotechnology integrates two fields of study: the '[[ecology]] of technics' and the 'technics of ecology,' requiring an understanding of the structures and processes of [[ecosystems]] and societies. All [[sustainable engineering]] that can reduce damage to ecosystems, adopt ecology as a fundamental basis, and ensure conservation of [[biodiversity]] and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology.

Ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a [[Holism|holistic]] point of view. For example, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of rivers should not only consider one single area. Rather, the whole [[Drainage basin|catchment area]], which includes the upstream, middle stream and downstream sections, should be considered.

Construction can reduce its impact on nature by consulting experts on the environment.

Sustainable development requires the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions. Ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Max|title=Eco-Friendly IT Solutions that Minimise Environmental Damage and Save Natural Resources|url=https://magora-systems.com/eco-friendly-it-solutions/|publisher=Magora|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources,
* control of impacts on ecosystems,
* development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products,
* eco-marketing,
* introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors, and
* development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public.

During ''Ecotechnics '95 - International Symposium on Ecological Engineering'' in [[Östersund]], [[Sweden]], the participants agreed on the definition: "Ecotechnics is defined as the method of designing future societies within ecological frames."

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

'''''Fake or Fortune?''''' is a [[BBC One]] television series which examines the [[provenance]] and attribution of notable [[art]]works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rts.org.uk/award/rts-west-england-awards-2016|title=RTS West of England Awards 2016 {{!}} Royal Television Society|website=rts.org.uk|language=en|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first series aired in 2011, ''Fake or Fortune?'' has drawn audiences of 5 million viewers in the UK&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-a-copy-fake-or-fortune-stars-try-to-halt-rival-show-6gstpwtrz |title=It’s a copy: Fake or Fortune? stars try to halt rival show |last=Brooks |first=Richard |date=4 December 2016 |work=The Times |access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the highest for an arts show in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbcstudios.com/case-studies/fake-or-fortune|title=Fake or Fortune|website=www.bbcstudios.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fake or Fortune?'' was created by [[art dealer]] and [[art history|art historian]] [[Philip Mould]] and producer Simon Shaw, inspired by Mould’s book ''Sleuth'' (2009), which was the programme’s working title during the development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/print-edition/2017/august/2304/interview/behind-the-scenes-at-fake-or-fortune/|title=Behind the scenes at Fake or Fortune? {{!}} Antiques Trade Gazette|last=Media|first=ATG|website=www.antiquestradegazette.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-presented by Mould and [[journalism|journalist]] [[Fiona Bruce]], with specialist research carried out by Dr. [[Bendor Grosvenor]] during the first five seasons.

==Synopsis==
In each episode Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce focus their attention on a painting (or a group of paintings), usually related to one particular artist. Season 7, episode 5 saw the show tackle their first [[sculpture]], a work attributed to [[Alberto Giacometti]]. The team, assisted by [[Bendor Grosvenor]] in series 1 to 5, investigate the paintings on a number of fronts: establishing the provenance of the piece by working backwards from present day to the time of the work's creation; on a forensic level, with investigation and scientific tests on the materials used to help establish specific time frames; and examining the unique painting styles and quirks of the artist. This evidence is then presented to established authorities to help demonstrate the legitimacy of the work and its possible addition to the relevant [[catalogue raisonné]].

| ShortSummary    = Experts determined whether three works - ''Lady with Dogs'', ''Darby and Joan'' and ''Crowd Scene'' - were genuine paintings by [[L. S. Lowry]] or forgeries. They had been bought in the 1960s by a Cheshire businessman, Gerald Ames. Lowry was described as "probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers." Experts analysed the paint used in one of the paintings, but the white paint did not match the flake white Lowry claimed to have always used. Lowry claimed to have only used five colours, [[White lead|flake white (lead white)]], [[ivory black]], [[Vermilion|vermillion red]], [[Prussian blue]] and [[yellow ochre]], produced by [[Winsor &amp; Newton]]. Photographic evidence from the 1950s, however, showed that he had experimented with both [[titanium white]] and [[zinc white]]: ''Darby and Joan'' contained traces of zinc white. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0612kxh/fake-or-fortune-series-4-1-lowry |title=BBC iPlayer - Fake or Fortune? - Series 4: 1.

| ShortSummary    = Charles Henty seeks to validate the provenance of two inherited paintings, one by [[Alfred Munnings]] and one, putatively by [[Winston Churchill]], discovered in a coal hole of a house in [[Ebury Street]]. Having suffered the death of his uncle, Charles wishes to sell the paintings to fund the continuation of a working farm in France.

Philip Mould visits David Coombs, a leading expert on the art of Churchill, who is unconvinced by the painting on account of the unfamiliarly well painted figures. He is particularly concerned by the colouring which, he feels, is tonally dissimilar to Churchill's accepted oeuvre. Having travelled to [[France]], the team discover, thanks to Luc Tombeur, that the painting is not of [[Èze]], as originally thought, but of the Fountain of Saint-Paul in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]]. They are introduced to Joy Lutenbacher, who recalls that her aunt, Joan Smith, witnessed Churchill paint the fountain. Bendor Grosvenor also finds evidence in a 1949 newsreel that Churchill painted the scene. Finally, Lutenbacher provides a signed photo of Churchill that had been given to Joan Smith, dated October 1945. Despite this evidence, Coombs' initial 'serious misgivings' have not disappeared, and he decides to include the painting in his [[catalogue raisonné]], although only in the 'Mysteries' section.

Munnings' painting ''[[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]] Winter Landscape'' is found to be of a scene of which the artist was particularly fond and painted more than five times. In a twist of fate, the church depicted in the painting is the final resting place of a notorious art forger, [[Tom Keating]], who was known to have forged Munnings' work. However, this is a mere coincidence and experts Lorian Peralta-Ramos and Dr Bill Teatheredge agree that the painting should be accepted as a work by Munnings.

| ShortSummary       = A [[portrait]] purportedly done by [[Lucian Freud]] is brought to the attention of the team. However, an outright denial by Freud himself looms over the team; the artist claimed he never painted the artwork under investigation. Faced with repudiating the words of the artist himself, the team trace the painting back to Freud's time during his teenage years at [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]], just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Fiona finds out through both a previous work's history and through an interview with Freud's daughter that Freud didn't consider works he finished himself to be worthy of his attention, especially ones where someone else had done work on his artwork, suggesting a reason for his denial. Despite the hope of [[DNA evidence]] by an embedded hair in the painting not panning out, notes from Freud's [[solicitor]] and forensic evidence of the paint and the paint strokes indicate most of the painting was done by one hand, possibly done on an abandoned canvas that already was painted beforehand at the art school Freud attended and then discarded to the side. In the end, when presented with the collected evidence, a panel of three experts on Freud's work deem the painting to have been mostly done by Freud, significantly increasing its value at auction.

| ShortSummary       = A woman asks the team to prove [[Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary|a work]], housed at Castle of Park in [[Aberdeenshire]], was painted by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The painting was acquired by the woman's husband when he worked for [[Christie's]] back in the 1980s, but he never managed to get it authenticated before he died. Delaroche did paint Saint Amelia as a royal commission done for [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Maria Amalia]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I]], before they were deposed in 1848. The artwork could thus be a [[lost work]] from the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. The alternative Philip needs to investigate is if it is instead a (legitimate) copy done by contemporary painters or printmakers, as Delaroche proved popular to replicate. Bendor reveals at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in [[Surrey]], where [[Queen Victoria]] offered the deposed couple refuge from the Revolution, that the artwork in question did reach English shores, as it is prominently displayed in a painting of Amalia's bedroom by historical watercolour artist [[Joseph Nash]]. Differences in colour to known copies of the painting are scientifically explained by pigment degradation. Though the team is unable to establish the provenance between the death of Maria Amalia's son in 1896 and the 1980s purchase, the painting is still deemed to be a genuine Delaroche and the lost work of Maria Amalia. In an 11th hour surprise, the appraiser reveals a letter written by Delaroche where he details how he was disgusted at the pitiful state of the picture when he saw it looking over the commission of a [[stained glass window]] version of his artwork and he undertakes the task of restoring the picture back to its former state, thus explaining the rest of the artifacts revealed by the forensic analysis.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2016|07|31|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  A [[Lincolnshire]] resident asks the team to investigate a sketch that is purported to be done by [[Auguste Rodin]]. Known primarily for sculptures like ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Thinker]]'', Rodin was also accomplished as an artist in other forms, his best known work being a series of [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] of a [[Royal ballet of Cambodia|Cambodian dance troupe]] that toured in Paris around the turn of the 20th century. The drawing was inherited from the owner's mother while she was living in Mexico in the 1940s after doing some work for the interior of a restaurant. Bendor's research reveals that of an estimated 150 Cambodian sketches done by Rodin, 120 are in the [[Musee Rodin]] and 21 authentic works are in other museums, which leaves fewer than 10 in private hands. In addition, Rodin was an often-counterfeited artist in both his sculptures and artwork. The name [[Ernest Durig]] pops up in the research: at the time, he was known as a respectable sculptor and art dealer, but long after the drawing was given to the owner's mother, Durig was exposed as a prolific forger of Rodin; his name was most recently at the center of a Rodin sketches forgery scandal at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 2014. Going to the Musée Rodin, Fiona finds out that the dancers had mesmerized Rodin so much that one series of sketches was done on wrapping paper obtained from a [[greengrocer]], due to his forgetting his sketch paper. When looking at several other sketches, Philip latches on to a particular technique of Rodin, where he blotted the watercolours with minimal strokes while making the dancers seem to be floating. Denied access to a cache of Durig sketches at [[MoMA]] for comparison, a signature expert casts more doubt, leading Fiona to reveal that Rodin would leave it up to recipients of his sketches to make their own signature, as he couldn't be cared to sign his works. The appraiser who revealed the Rodin fakes at the Musée d'Orsay deems the sketch to be not by Rodin, but by the forger Durig.

| ShortSummary       = The team investigate two possible works by [[Paul Gauguin]] which have been brought to their attention. One appeared to be the first pencil sketch for Gauguin's Tahitian masterpiece ''[[When Will You Marry?|When Will you Marry?]].'' It had been bought by the viewer's art historian grandfather, but its authenticity was in doubt because it appeared to be a copy of a sketch in Gauguin's notebook. The team establish provenance that takes it back to Gauguin and show that it had been cut from the sketchbook sometime between 1916 and 1932. It is accepted as genuine by the Wildenstein Institute.

The second possible Gauguin is a still life depicting a bowl of fruit which had been sold as a genuine Gauguin several times and had appeared in a [[catalogue Raisonne]]. However, the signature and dedication had been added after the original paint had dried and the signature did not appear genuine. The sale in which it had first appeared included a number of works now attributed to other artists. Connoisseurship also raises doubts about the style and Mould and Bruce conclude that it is not genuine.

| ShortSummary       = A [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicolson]] painting, of a glass jug, plates and two pears, was purchased by a collector from the estate of her aunt, [[Lillian Browse]], a respected gallery owner and author of Nicholson's catalogue raisonné. The painting is not included, however, in the current catalogue raisonné compiled by expert Patricia Reed. A wealth of new scientific and documentary evidence was collected, including provenance to a previous wealthy London art-collector, [[x-ray]] evidence to show the board had originally borne a painting of [[freesia]]s (missing from Nicolson's catalogue), and a comparison of the pigments in the paint with traces left in an original painting box owned by Nicolson's grandson. Reed does not change her opinion, however, stating that there is insufficient evidence to show that it was definitely by Nicholson.&lt;ref name=Express2018-08-12/&gt; and not someone working alongside him.&lt;ref name="BBC-b0bg6f43"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicholson |series=''Fake or Fortune?'' |serieslink=Fake or Fortune? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bg6f43/fake-or-fortune-series-7-1-nicholson |accessdate=18 August 2018 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 12 August 2018  |seriesno=7 |number=1 |transcript= |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| DirectedBy    = Rachel Jardine
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|19|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  Two sketchbooks found in a garden shed in [[Saint-Émilion]] were given to a teenage boy, Alain, by his grandmother in 1965. Although she never revealed their origin, they were thought to be the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Alain waited 50 years before presenting the sketches to the committee responsible for authenticating the work of Toulouse-Lautrec. The committee did not accept them as authentic and concluded they were the work of another artist [[René Princeteau]]. The sketchbooks contain images of women, horses, sailors, soldiers and dogs, not the subjects for which Toulouse-Lautrec is best known. Some of the pages are dated 1880, when Toulouse-Lautrec would have been just a teenager. The team travel to [[Albi]] in southern France, where Toulouse-Lautrec was born, and visit his family home, Chateau du Bosc, where he spent much of his youth. Compelling technical analysis is provided by print expert Harriet Stratis from [[Chicago]] who reports that the sketchbooks match those already known to be by Toulouse-Lautrec and that some sheets have tiny pin-pricks in each corner, which are a distinctive feature of the artist's hand. The committee does not provide a clear decision either way, but offers to re-examine the books at a later date.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|26|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate whether a small watercolour sketch could be by the British 20th-century sculptor [[Henry Moore]], thought to be the only piece by a British artist in a private collection of around 1,500 works discovered in Germany in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/drawing-in-the-gurlitt-hoard-an-unknown-henry-moore-1193831&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[2012 Munich artworks discovery|Gurlitt Hoard]], it is suspected to contain many objects of art looted by the Nazis, and the team is now asked by the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Museum of Fine Art]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, to find out if the sketch is among these. Philip meets Moore's only child Mary, who says she can see her father's hand in the sketch. Forensic tests on the ink used in the sketch are inconclusive, but [[infrared]] analysis reveals more sketches on the back of the paper. Fiona discovers that in the early 1930s [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], the man who amassed the hoard, worked as a museum curator and exhibited works by Moore who, at the time, was less appreciated at home in Britain. Furthermore, Gurlitt later became one of only four dealers asked to sell off what the Nazis branded as [[degenerate art]] on the international market, purchasing some for himself. When the team find an accurate description of the sketch, they can link one of Gurlitt's purchases to what was exhibited years before, thus establishing an unbroken provenance. In the end the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] accepts the sketch as a genuine Moore.

| Title             = A Double Whodunnit
| DirectedBy        = Francis Welch
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|09|02|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary      = The team investigates two rare portraits of [[black British]] subjects from the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures which are highly unusual in their positive depiction of black sitters at a time when Britain was still heavily engaged in [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]]. 

The first case is a double portrait featuring [[Dido Elizabeth Belle|Dido Belle]], a former slave who became a member of the aristocratic Mansfield family, and her cousin Lady Elizabeth. The painting is on display at [[Scone Palace]] in Scotland and was commissioned by the first [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Dido Belle's guardian, sometime in the late 1770s or early 1780s. The [[Abolitionism|abolishionist]] Mansfield, a judge, had ruled in the infamous case of the [[Zong massacre]]. The painting's original attribution, to [[Johan Zoffany]], is considered wrong, but the identity of the actual artist is unclear. The second painting, even more unusual, is of two beautifully-dressed black girls holding a book in what appears to be a tropical landscape. Early clues suggest this could be a political painting, perhaps connected to the campaign to abolish slavery in British colonies. The signature was not legible.

In the end, forensic and other evidence revealed the first portrait to be by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]] and the second by [[Emma Soyer|Emma Jones]].

| ShortSummary       = Answering the programme's call for works of art other than paintings, Philip and Fiona investigate what appears to be a [[plaster cast|plaster]] sculpture of [[Alberto Giacometti]]'s early work ''Tete qui regarde'' or ''[[Gazing Head]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-set-to-appear-in-the-new-series-of-the-fake-or-fortune-television-show-1-4970438|title=Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts set to appear in the new series of the Fake or Fortune? television show|first=Emma|last=Knights|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti"&gt;https://twitter.com/philipmould/status/1038857131821281281&lt;/ref&gt; The object shows signs of extensive damage, and a [[CT scan]] reveals it has been stapled, stitched and glued back together several times. Philip visits the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]] at the University of East Anglia, where he learns more about how the cast would have been produced. The investigation leads Fiona to France where the current owner's grandmother modelled at the same time and place where Giacometti worked. Without a clear trail of evidence linking the piece to the sculptor, however, the team changes its approach, and discovers that one of the genuine ''Gazing Head'' plasters is considered lost by its British owner, the estate of [[Sidney John Woods|S. J. Woods]], suggesting that it might be possible the piece was purchased from Woods rather than in Paris. 

When the piece and the collected evidence is presented to the [[Giacometti Foundation]] in Paris, the first response is that further studies needed to be made. After several months - the episode was originally scheduled to be aired as part of series 6&lt;ref name="Giacometti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti" /&gt; - their provisional findings conclude the piece was once an original sculpture by Giacometti, but that the damage sustained may prevent them from accepting it as a genuine work.

==Reception==
{{update|section|reason=reviews and coverage of later series|date=August 2017}}
Describing the outcome of the first episode of series one as a "scandal", Sam Wollaston writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' found the programme "incredibly interesting" and praised it "for being about just one case in which you can become totally involved, instead of flitting between three, which is what so many documentaries seem to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=TV review: ''Fake or Fortune?''; ''The Marriage Ref''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/19/tv-review-fake-or-fortune|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Ceri Radford was described as being "flabbergasted" at the result of the first episode, but concluded her review by saying: "This may have been a disappointing finale, but it at least confirmed that this aesthetically pleasing, quietly enjoyable new series isn't afraid to thwart expectations."&lt;ref name="Radford" /&gt; [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] in ''[[The Independent]]'' had a mixed view as a result of the presentation of the facts, saying: "It was full of cliffhanger tension and thrilling moments of discovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21686">'''German studies''' is the field of [[humanities]] that researches, documents, and disseminates [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] in both its historic and present forms. Academic departments of German studies often include classes on [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], [[German history]], and [[German politics]] in addition to the language and literature component. Common German names for the field are {{lang|de|Germanistik}}, {{lang|de|Deutsche Philologie}}, and {{lang|de|Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft und Literaturwissenschaft}}. In English the terms '''Germanistics''' or '''Germanics''' are sometimes used (mostly by Germans), but the subject is more often referred to as ''German studies'', ''German language and literature'', or ''German philology''.

Modern German studies is usually seen as a combination of two sub-disciplines:  German linguistics and Germanophone literature studies.

==German linguistics==

German linguistics is traditionally called [[philology]] in Germany, as there is something of a difference between philologists and linguists{{vague|date=September 2012}}. It is roughly divided as follows:
* [[Old High German]] (''Althochdeutsch'') 8th – 11th centuries
* [[Middle High German]] (''Mittelhochdeutsch'') 11th – 14th centuries
* [[Early New High German]] (''Frühneuhochdeutsch'') 14th – 17th centuries
* [[Modern German]] ([[Standard German]], [[German dialectology]]) 18th – 21st centuries

In addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).

==German literature studies==

The study [[German literature]] is divided into two parts: {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Ältere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft'' deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by ''Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft''. The field systematically examines German literature in terms of [[genre]], [[wikt:form|form]], [[Content (media and publishing)|content]], and [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch.  Important areas include [[edition philology]], [[history of literature]], and [[textual interpretation]].  The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-14-051363-9}}) is printed in English but contains many [[German-language]] literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of [[literary criticism]]; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by [[English-language]] critics and scholars.

== German teacher education ==
At least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the left navigation at the web page of one of the [[Cologne University]] German studies institutes at http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linguistics]] of [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|Sprachwissenschaft}}'')
* German language and literature of up to about 1750 (''{{lang|de|Ältere Sprache und Literatur}}'')
* German language and literature since approximately 1750 (''{{lang|de|Neuere Literaturwissenschaft}}'')
* Specifics of the [[didactics]] of teaching German (''{{lang|de|Fachdidaktik}}'')
Several universities offer specialized curriculae for school teachers, usually called "''{{lang|de|Deutsch (Lehramt)}}''". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the [[federal states of Germany]] cultural authorities, called the ''{{lang|de|[[Staatsexamen]]}}'' ("state exam").

==German media studies==
In recent years{{when|date=September 2012}}, German{{who|date=September 2012}} has looked for links with the fields of [[communication]]s, [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]].  In addition, the sub-branch of [[film studies]] has established itself.

==History==

As an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to [[Tacitus]]' ''Germania''. The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval [[Bible]] translations, were all undertaken during the [[German Renaissance]] of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies.  As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by  [[Georg Friedrich Benecke]], the [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[Karl Lachmann]].

{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
'''Harshness''' (also called '''raucousness'''), in [[music information retrieval]], is a Non-Contextual Low-Level Audio Descriptors (NLDs) that represents one dimension of the multi-dimensional [[psychoacoustic]] feature called as musical [[timbre]].

Classical timbre’ NLDs are [[surface roughness|roughness]], [[spectral centroid]], and [[spectral flux]]. While harmonicity and inharmonicity can also be considered NLDs, harshness differs from them, as well as from roughness, once it reckons for a distinguished perceptual audio feature expressed by the summary spectral periodicity. This feature is especially clear in single-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]], single-[[Musical note|note]], musical audio, where the timbre of two different musical instruments can greatly differ in levels of harshness (e.g., the difference in harshness between a flute and a saxophone is evident). As it is supposed to be, harshness is independent of all others NLDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14942">'''Iconology''' is a method of interpretation in cultural history and the history of art used by [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]] and their followers that uncovers the cultural, social, and historical background of themes and subjects in the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is derived from synthesis rather than scattered analysis and examines symbolic meaning on more than its face value by reconciling it with its historical context and with the artist's body of work&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biddingtons.com/content/pedigreeicon.html Iconography and Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; in contrast to the widely descriptive [[iconography]], which, as described by Panofsky, is an approach to studying the content and meaning of works of art that is primarily focused on classifying, establishing dates, provenance and other necessary fundamental knowledge concerning the subject matter of an artwork that is needed for further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Panofsky strongly differentiated between iconology and iconography, the distinction is not very widely followed, "and they have never been given definitions accepted by all iconographers and iconologists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few 21st-century authors continue to use the term consistently.

It should also be noted that Panofsky's "use of iconology as the principle tool of art analysis brought him critics." For instance, in 1946, [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]] "criticized Panofsky's iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistorians.info/panofskye Dictionary of Art Historians: Panofsky, Erwin]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, iconology is mostly avoided by social historians who do not accept the theoretical dogmaticism in the work of Panofsky.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von Beyme, "Why is there no Political Science of the Arts?" In Udo J. Hebel and Christoph Wagner, eds., ''Pictorial Cultures and Political Iconographies: Approaches, Perspectives, Case Studies from Europe and America''. Berlin and New York 2011, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contrast to iconography==
Erwin Panofsky defines iconography as "a known principle in the known world", while iconology is "an iconography turned interpretive".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tudor, ''Image and Influence: Studies in the Sociology of Film''. New York 1974, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his view, iconology tries to reveal the underlying principles that form the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical perspective, which is modulated by one personality and condensed into one work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roelof van Straten, iconology "can explain why an artist or patron chose a particular subject at a specific location and time and represented it in a certain way. An iconological investigation should concentrate on the social-historical, not art-historical, influences and values that the artist might not have consciously brought into play but are nevertheless present. The artwork is primarily seen as a document of its time."&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg used the term "iconography" in his early research, replacing it in 1908 with "iconology" in his particular method of visual interpretation called "critical iconology", which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hatt]] and Charlotte Klonk, "Iconography - iconology: Erwin Panofsky". In ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to Its Methods''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Zum Problem der Beschreibung und Inhaltsdeutung von Werken der bildenden Kunst." ''Logos'', Vol. 21 (1932), pp. 103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, an understanding of the history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, iconology interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using "synthetic intuition". The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist's intention, is the object of iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, pp.13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Panofsky emphasized that "iconology can be done when there are no originals to look at and nothing but artificial light to work in."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Holly, ''Panofsky and the Foundations of Art History''. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1984, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ernst Gombrich]], "the emerging discipline of iconology ... must ultimately do for the image what linguistics has done for the word."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''Reflections on the History of Art: Views and Reviews'', ed. Richard Woodfield. Oxford 1987, p.246.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Camille]] is of the opinion that "though Panofsky's concept of iconology has been very influential in the humanities and is quite effective when applied to Renaissance art, it is still problematic when applied to art from periods before and after."&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.arizona.edu/downloads/Garcia,_Dominique_Writing_Sample.pdf Dominique E. Garcia, "Nationalistic Iconography and 'Anti-Iconology' of the Aztec Coatlicue Sculpture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuances==
In 1952, [[Creighton Gilbert]] added another opinion about the meaning of the word "iconology". According to his view, iconology was not the actual investigation of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian [[Hans Sedlmayr]] differentiated between "sachliche" and "methodische" iconology. "Sachliche" iconology refers to the "general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them." In contrast, "methodische" iconology is the "integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407705539/iconology-and-iconography.html Encyclopedia.com: Iconology and Iconography]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology'' (1986), [[W.J.T. Mitchell]] writes that iconology is a study of "what to say about images", concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of "what images say" – the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iconictheory.blogspot.de/2010/05/iconology.html Karen Hope, The Iconic Image: Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic "iconic turn", emphasizing the role of "non-linguistic symbol systems".&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology''. University of Chicago Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-sites.net/english/mitchell.htm w.j.t. mitchell and the image (review)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, "Iconology and Ideology: Panofsky, Althusser, and the Scene of Recognition". In David B. Downing and Susan Bazargan, eds., ''Image and Ideology in Modern/Postmodern Discourse''. New York 1991, pp.321-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of just pointing out the difference between the material (pictorial or artistic) images, "he pays attention to the dialectic relationship between material images and mental images".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ksangmin.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/w-j-t-mitchell-iconology-and-picture-theory/ W. J. T. Mitchell's Iconology and Picture Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term "iconology" can also be used for characterizing "a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes" and the idea about "multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning" in order to get "the total picture” of learning. "Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol8/bartelo_morton.pdf Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, "Iconology: An Alternate Form of Writing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, new approaches to iconology have developed in the theory of images. This is the case of what [[Jean-Michel Durafour]], French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call "econology", a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing iconology, ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (''eikon'') self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (''oikos''). The iconology, mainly Warburghian iconology, is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others ([[Arne Næss]], etc.) from the writings of [[Kinji Imanishi]]. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are juste one. One of the main consequences is that the "specity", the living individual, "self-eco-speciates its place of life" (''Freedom in Evolution''). As far as the images are concerned: "If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: ''the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Durafour, ''"L'Étrange Créature du lac noir" de Jack Arnold. Aubades pour une zoologie des images'', Aix-en-Provence, Rouge profond, 2017, 200 p. ({{ISBN|978-2915083910}}), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Studies in iconology==
''Studies in Iconology'' is the title of a book by Erwin Panofsky on humanistic themes in the art of the Renaissance, which was first published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a peer-reviewed series of books started in 2014 under the editorship of [[Barbara Baert]] and published by Peeters international academic publishers, [[Leuven]], Belgium, addressing the deeper meaning of the visual medium throughout human history in the fields of philosophy, art history, theology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeters-leuven.be/search_serie_book.asp?nr=284 Peeters Publishers: Studies in Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''illuminated manuscript''' is a [[manuscript]] in which the text is supplemented with such decoration as [[initial]]s, borders ([[marginalia]]) and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature illustrations]]. In the strictest definition, the term refers only to manuscripts decorated with either gold or silver; but in both common usage and modern scholarship, the term refers to any decorated or illustrated manuscript from Western traditions. Comparable Far Eastern and Mesoamerican works are described as painted. [[Islam]]ic manuscripts may be referred to as illuminated, illustrated or painted, though using essentially the same techniques as Western works. 

The earliest extant substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period 400 to 600, produced in the [[Kingdom of the Ostrogoths]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their significance lies not only in their inherent artistic and historical value, but also in the maintenance of a link of literacy offered by non-illuminated texts. Had it not been for the [[monastic]] scribes of [[Late Antiquity]], most literature of Greece and Rome would have perished. As it was, the patterns of textual survivals were shaped by their usefulness to the severely constricted literate group of Christians. Illumination of manuscripts, as a way of aggrandizing ancient documents, aided their preservation and informative value in an era when new ruling classes were no longer literate, at least in the language used in the manuscripts.

The majority of extant manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many survive from the [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from Late Antiquity. The majority are of a religious nature. Especially from the 13th century onward, an increasing number of secular texts were illuminated. Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded [[scroll]]s. A very few illuminated fragments survive on [[papyrus]], which does not last nearly as long as [[vellum]] or [[parchment]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called vellum.

Beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]], manuscripts began to be produced on paper.&lt;ref&gt;The untypically early 11th century [[Missal of Silos]] is from Spain, near to Muslim paper manufacturing centres in [[Al-Andaluz]]. Textual manuscripts on paper become increasingly common, but the more expensive parchment was mostly used for illuminated manuscripts until the end of the period.&lt;/ref&gt; Very early printed books were sometimes produced with spaces left for [[rubric]]s and miniatures, or were given illuminated initials, or decorations in the margin, but the introduction of printing rapidly led to the decline of illumination. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be produced in the early 16th century but in much smaller numbers, mostly for the very wealthy. They are among the most common items to survive from the Middle Ages; many thousands survive. They are also the best surviving specimens of medieval painting, and the best preserved. Indeed, for many areas and time periods, they are the only surviving examples of painting.

==History==
{{main|History of miniature (illuminated manuscript)}}
Art historians classify illuminated manuscripts into their historic periods and types, including (but not limited to) Late Antique, [[Insular art|Insular]], [[Carolingian art|Carolingian manuscripts]], [[Ottonian art|Ottonian manuscripts]], [[Romanesque art|Romanesque manuscripts]], [[Gothic art|Gothic manuscripts]], and [[Renaissance art|Renaissance manuscripts]]. There are a few examples from later periods. The type of book most often heavily and richly illuminated, sometimes known as a "display book", varied between periods. In the first millennium, these were most likely to be [[Gospel Book]]s, such as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the [[Book of Kells]]. The Romanesque period saw the creation of many large illuminated complete [[Bible]]s – one in Sweden requires three librarians to lift it. Many [[Psalter]]s were also heavily illuminated in both this and the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]]. Single cards or posters of [[vellum]], [[leather]] or paper were in wider circulation with short stories or legends on them about the lives of saints, chivalry knights or other mythological figures, even criminal, social or miraculous occurrences; popular events much freely used by story tellers and itinerant actors to support their plays. Finally, the [[Book of Hours]], very commonly the personal devotional book of a wealthy layperson, was often richly illuminated in the Gothic period. Other books, both liturgical and not, continued to be illuminated at all periods. 

The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world produced manuscripts in its own style, versions of which spread to other Orthodox and Eastern Christian areas. The [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim World]] and in particular the Iberian Peninsula, with their [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|traditions of literacy]] uninterrupted by the Middle Ages, were instrumental in delivering ancient classic works to the growing intellectual circles and [[universities]] of Western Europe all through the 12th century, as books were produced there in large numbers and on [[History of paper|paper]] for the first time in Europe, and with them full treatises on the sciences, especially astrology and medicine where illumination was required to have profuse and accurate representations with the text.

The Gothic period, which generally saw an increase in the production of these artifacts, also saw more secular works such as [[chronicle]]s and works of literature illuminated. Wealthy people began to build up personal libraries; [[Philip the Bold]] probably had the largest personal library of his time in the mid-15th century, is estimated to have had about 600 illuminated manuscripts, whilst a number of his friends and relations had several dozen.

[[File:Books in the monastery museum (5494269533).jpg|thumb|Illuminated manuscripts housed in the 16th-century [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox church]] of [[Ura Kidane Mehret]], [[Zege Peninsula]], [[Lake Tana]], [[Ethiopia]]]]
Up to the 12th century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a [[Commission (art)|commission]] from a wealthy patron. Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the [[monks]] who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a [[scriptorium]]. Within the walls of a scriptorium were individualized areas where a monk could sit and work on a manuscript without being disturbed by his fellow brethren. If no scriptorium was available, then “separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The separation of these monks from the rest of the cloister indicates just how revered these monks were within their society.

By the 14th century, the [[cloisters]] of monks writing in the scriptorium had almost fully given way to commercial urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 45&lt;/ref&gt; While the process of creating an illuminated manuscript did not change, the move from monasteries to commercial settings was a radical step. Demand for manuscripts grew to an extent that Monastic libraries began to employ secular scribes and illuminators.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 57&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day. In reality, illuminators were often well known and acclaimed and many of their identities have survived.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the manuscript was “sent to the [[rubricator]], who added (in red or other colors) the titles, [[headlines]], the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"/&gt; In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would “undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe’s agent,) but by the time that the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator there was no longer any scope for innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. Medieval Craftsmen: Scribes and Illuminations. Buffalo: University of Toronto, 1992. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
[[File:Roman de la Rose f. 28r (Author at writing desk).jpg|thumb|The author of a manuscript at his writing desk. 14th Century]]
Illumination was a complex and frequently costly process. It was usually reserved for special books: an altar Bible, for example. Wealthy people often had richly illuminated "[[book of hours|books of hours]]" made, which set down prayers appropriate for various times in the [[liturgy|liturgical day]].

In the early Middle Ages, most books were produced in monasteries, whether for their own use, for presentation, or for a commission. However, commercial [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] grew up in large cities, especially [[School of Paris|Paris]], and in Italy and the Netherlands, and by the late 14th century there was a significant industry producing manuscripts, including agents who would take long-distance commissions, with details of the heraldry of the buyer and the saints of personal interest to him (for the calendar of a Book of hours). By the end of the period, many of the painters were women, perhaps especially in Paris.

=== Text ===
The text was usually written before the manuscripts were illuminated. Sheets of [[parchment]] or [[vellum parchment|vellum]] were cut down to the appropriate size. After the general layout of the page was planned (including the initial capitals and borders), the page was lightly ruled with a pointed stick, and the scribe went to work with ink-pot and either sharpened [[quill]] feather or reed pen. The script depended on local customs and tastes. The sturdy Roman letters of the early [[Middle Ages]] gradually gave way to scripts such as [[Uncial]] and half-Uncial, especially in the [[British Isles]], where distinctive scripts such as [[insular majuscule]] and [[insular minuscule]] developed. Stocky, richly textured [[blackletter]] was first seen around the 13th century and was particularly popular in the later Middle Ages.

Prior to the days of such careful planning, “A typical black-letter page of these [[Gothic art|Gothic]] years would show a page in which the lettering was cramped and crowded into a format dominated by huge ornamented capitals that descended from uncial forms or by illustrations.”&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Donald M. The Art of Written Forms: The Theory and Practice of Calligraphy. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent such poorly made manuscripts and illuminations from occurring a script was typically supplied first, “and blank spaces were left for the decoration. This pre-supposes very careful planning by the scribe even before he put pen to parchment.” If the [[scribe]] and the illuminator were separate labors the planning period allowed for adequate space to be given to each individual.

=== The process of illumination ===

The following steps outline the detailed labor involved to create the illuminations of one page of a manuscript:
# [[Silverpoint]] drawing of the design were executed
# Burnished gold dots applied
# The application of modulating colors
# Continuation of the previous three steps in addition to the outlining of marginal figures
# The penning of a rinceaux appearing in the border of a page
# The final step, the marginal figures are painted&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Robert G. "Stages of Execution: Procedures of Illumination as Revealed in an Unfinished Book of Hours." International Center of Medieval Art 17.1 (1978): 61–70. JSTOR.org. Web. 17 April 2010. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/766713&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumination and decoration was normally planned at the inception of the work, and space reserved for it. However, the text was usually written before illumination began. In the Early Medieval period the text and illumination were often done by the same people, normally monks, but by the [[High Middle Ages]] the roles were typically separated, except for routine initials and flourishes, and by at least the 14th century there were secular workshops producing manuscripts, and by the beginning of the 15th century these were producing most of the best work, and were commissioned even by monasteries. When the text was complete, the illustrator set to work. Complex designs were planned out beforehand, probably on wax tablets, the sketch pad of the era. The design was then traced or drawn onto the vellum (possibly with the aid of pinpricks or other markings, as in the case of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]). Many incomplete manuscripts survive from most periods, giving us a good idea of working methods.

At all times, most manuscripts did not have images in them. In the early Middle Ages, manuscripts tend to either be display books with very full illumination, or manuscripts for study with at most a few decorated initials and flourishes. By the Romanesque period many more manuscripts had decorated or [[historiated initial]]s, and manuscripts essentially for study often contained some images, often not in color. This trend intensified in the Gothic period, when most manuscripts had at least decorative flourishes in places, and a much larger proportion had images of some sort. Display books of the Gothic period in particular had very elaborate decorated borders of foliate patterns, often with small [[drolleries]]. A Gothic page might contain several areas and types of decoration: a miniature in a frame, a historiated initial beginning a passage of text, and a border with drolleries. Often different artists worked on the different parts of the decoration.

=== Use of color in illuminated manuscripts ===
While the use of gold is by far one of the most captivating features of illuminated manuscripts, the bold use of varying colors provided multiple layers of dimension to the illumination. From a religious perspective, "the diverse colors wherewith the book is illustrated, not unworthily represent the multiple grace of heavenly wisdom."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"/&gt; While religious authors view themselves as instilling a part of God's vast glory on the work, many illustrations can be linked to "the history of the texts that were required to be illustrated and the needs and tastes of the readers of those manuscripts."&lt;ref name="jrank1"&gt;"Manuscript." http://arts.jrank.org/pages/9716/Manuscript.html. Web. 17 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Color brought the images on the page to life and captivated the readers. Without color the impact of the image would have been completely lost.

=== Paints ===
The medieval artist's palette was broad; a partial list of pigments is given below. In addition, unlikely-sounding substances such as urine and earwax were used to prepare pigments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/spanish/medievaliberia/manuscript_glossary_O-P.html Iberian manuscripts (pigments)] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20030329222834/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/spanish/medievaliberia/manuscript_glossary_O-P.html |date=29 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--True, check this and other references before taking this as a joke!--&gt;

=== Gilding ===
[[Image:Sakramentarz tyniecki 02.jpg|thumb|The 11th-century ''Tyniec Sacramentary'' was written with gold on a purple background. [[National Library of Poland]], [[Warsaw]].]]
A manuscript is not considered illuminated unless one or many illuminations contained [[gold foil]] or was brushed with gold specks, a process known as ''burnishing''. The inclusion of gold alludes to many different possibilities for the text. If the text is of religious nature the gold is a sign of exalting the text. In the early centuries of Christianity, “[[Gospel]] manuscripts were sometimes written entirely in gold.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques. Toronto: University of Toronto, 2001. Print,52.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from adding flashy decoration to the text, scribes during the time considered themselves to be praising God with their use of gold. In one particular instance, “The life of Christ executed on gold backgrounds with much greater richness in the midst of innumerable scenes of the chase, tourneys, games and grotesque subjects.”&lt;ref name="newadvent1910"&gt;Brehier, Louis. “Illuminated Manuscripts.” The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol.9. New York: Robert Appelton Company, 1910. 17 April 2010 http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09620a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, gold was used if a patron who had commissioned a book to be written wished to display the vastness of his riches. Eventually, the addition of gold to manuscripts became so frequent, “that its value as a barometer of status with the manuscript was degraded.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. Medieval Craftsmen: Scribes and Illuminations. Buffalo: University of Toronto, 1992. Print,49.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period the price of gold had become so cheap that its inclusion in an illuminated manuscript accounted for only a tenth of the cost of production.&lt;ref name="Brehier"&gt;Brehier, Louis. “Illuminated Manuscripts.” The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol.9. New York: Robert Appelton Company, 1910. 17 April 2010 http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09620a.htm, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; By adding richness and depth to the manuscript, the use of gold in illuminations created pieces of art that are still valued today.

The application of gold leaf or dust to an illumination is a very detailed process that only the most skilled illuminators can undertake and successfully achieve. The first detail an illuminator considered when dealing with gold was whether to use [[gold leaf]] or specks of gold that could be applied with a brush. When working with gold leaf the pieces would be hammered and thinned until they were “thinner than the thinnest paper.”&lt;ref name="Brehier" /&gt; The use of this type of leaf allowed for numerous areas of the text to be outlined in gold. There were several ways of applying gold to an illumination one of the most popular included mixing the gold with stag’s glue and then “pour it into water and dissolve it with your finger.”&lt;ref&gt;Blondheim, D.S. "An Old Portuguese Work on Manuscript Illumination." The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series 19.2 (1928): 97–135. JSTOR. Web. 17 April 2010. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1451766&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the gold was soft and malleable in the water it was ready to be applied to the page. Illuminators had to be very careful when applying gold leaf to the manuscript. Gold leaf is able to "adhere to any pigment which had already been laid, ruining the design, and secondly the action of burnishing it is vigorous and runs the risk of smudging any painting already around it."

== Patrons of illumination ==
Monasteries produced manuscripts for their own use; heavily illuminated ones tended to be reserved for liturgical use in the early period, while the monastery library held plainer texts. In the early period manuscripts were often commissioned by rulers for their own personal use or as diplomatic gifts, and many old manuscripts continued to be given in this way, even into the [[Early Modern]] period. Especially after the book of hours became popular, wealthy individuals commissioned works as a sign of status within the community, sometimes including [[donor portrait]]s or [[heraldry]]: "In a scene from the New Testament, Christ would be shown larger than an apostle, who would be bigger than a mere bystander in the picture, while the humble donor of the painting or the artist himself might appear as a tiny figure in the corner."&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 1 | publisher = University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division | isbn = 0-8020-8173-8 | last = Hamel | first = Christopher de | title = The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques | page = 20 | date = 29 December 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossH.asp|title = Heraldry|date = n.d.|accessdate = 14 December 2015|website = Glossary for Illuminated Manuscripts|publisher = British Library|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar was also personalized, recording the feast days of local or family saints. By the end of the Middle Ages many manuscripts were produced for distribution through a network of agents, and blank spaces might be reserved for the appropriate heraldry to be added locally by the buyer.

Displaying the amazing detail and richness of a text, the addition of illumination was never an afterthought. The inclusion of illumination is twofold, it added value to the work, but more importantly it provides pictures for the illiterate members of society to "make the reading seem more vivid and perhaps more credible.”&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Susan. "Manuscript Illumination in Northern Europe". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/manu/hd_manu.htm (October 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]] ({{Lang-la|Berytus}}). It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of [[jurisprudence]] until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitutions]] and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal [[precedent]]s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under [[Augustus]] in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"&gt;Walker 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"/&gt;

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charnock 1859, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]] legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology |date=July–August 2011 | volume=64 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during AD 222–235;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon 1854, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles Ménage]], a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudorff  1857, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer 1868, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen 1901, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jidejian 1973, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36"&gt;Clark 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174"&gt;Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From 425, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt; because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle 2008, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Mosaic depicting the bust of a severe-looking man wearing a crown and an intricate royal purple tunic.|[[Justinian I]], the emperor who instigated the rewriting of Roman law]]
Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt; which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 224–240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard 1999, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.&lt;ref name="Corcoran"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Corcoran, Simon | authorlink=Simon Corcoran | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106095259/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | archivedate=November 6, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;Monro 1872, pp. xviii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 1–4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.&lt;/ref&gt; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5–11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12–19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland 1921, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/&gt;

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt; He is believed to have taught as of {{circa|lk=no|400}} or {{circa|lk=no|410}}. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyrillus |volume=7 |page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert 1906, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 132–138&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2"&gt;Monro 1872, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim 1921, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius 1596, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 to c. 395)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gaza City|Gazan]] lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"/&gt;

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7"&gt;Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another late 5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk 2009, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350,&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 63–73&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 61–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skaf 2005, pp. 224–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel 1973, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuz"&gt;Schulz 1967, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/&gt; His 533 ''Omnem'' constitution read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]]. Under [[Cyrillus]], the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attridge  1992, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...&lt;ref name="digest2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late 16th-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741 by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192"&gt;Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the 9th century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91"&gt;Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307"&gt;Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35–36"&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.&lt;ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300"&gt;Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25"&gt;Evans 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29241">'''Latin manuscripts of the New Testament''' are handwritten copies of translations from the Greek originals. Translations of the New Testament are called ''versions''. They are important in [[textual criticism]], because sometimes versions provide evidence (called a ''witness'') to an earlier reading of the Greek, i.e. to the text that may have been lost (or preserved only very poorly) in the subsequent Greek tradition. It is also hypothesised that, in some cases, for example, in the case of the [[Codex Bezae]], early Latin manuscripts may have influenced some early Greek manuscripts. Thus, accidentally or deliberately, some Latin readings may have "crossed back over" into the Greek. One possible example of this is the well known [[Comma Johanneum]].

Latin manuscripts are divided into "Old Latin" and [[Vulgate]]. Old Latin manuscripts, also called ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' or ''Itala'', are so called not because they are written in [[Old Latin]] (i.e. Latin prior to 75 BC), but because they are the oldest versions of the New Testament in Latin. From the linguistic point of view, Old Latin New Testament manuscripts may at times use non-standard grammar and vocabulary.

Unlike the Vulgate, the Vetus Latina tradition reflects numerous distinct, similar, and not entirely independent translations of various New Testament texts, extending back to the time of the original Greek autographs.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no such thing as a uniform version of the New Testament in Latin prior to Jerome's Vulgate". Elliott (1997:202).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 382 AD [[Jerome]] began a revision of the existing Vetus Latina into contemporary Latin, corrected against manuscripts in the original Greek and Hebrew. [[List of New Testament Latin manuscripts#Jerome's version|Jerome's version]] is known as the [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, UBS4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clarification ==
=== Identification ===

The list of Old Latin manuscripts below is based on citations in ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (NA27) and ''The Greek New Testament'' ([[United Bible Societies|UBS]]4). Each manuscript is identified first by its [[Scribal abbreviation|siglum]] (the first column, '''s.''', in the table), as given by the [[critical apparatus]] of the editions mentioned. These sigla are related to content, so are not unique. For example, the letter ''t'' refers to Codex Bernensis in the [[gospel]]s, but [[Liber Comicus]] elsewhere. So sigla need disambiguation. In the table below, this is done by providing a full name. Additionally, the standard unique serial number for each manuscript is provided. Taken together sigla, name and number provide unambiguous identification, and some further information regarding the content, history and relationship of manuscripts.

Sigla, names and numbers exist to serve different scholastic purposes. Sigla, in the context of reference to an ''original'' document, provide unique and concise identification of witnesses to the text of that original, suited to minimizing the space taken by citation in a critical apparatus. Names, on the other hand, normally refer to specific handwritten ''volumes'' (often including other text), either as originally bound or in their current form. Names are typically Latin, and can refer to the place of composition ([[Abbey library of Saint Gall|Codex Sangallensis]], "Book from [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]]") or rediscovery ([[Stonyhurst Gospel]]), the current location (Liber Ardmachanus, "[[Book of Armagh]]"), a famous owner (Codex Bezae, "[[Theodore Beza]]'s Book"), a volume's function (Liber Comicus, "The Lectionary"), or can even refer to physical characteristics of a volume ([[Codex Gigas]], "The Huge Book" or [[Codex Aureus (disambiguation)|Codex Aureus]], "The Gold Book"). The [[Book of Mulling]] is also known as Liber Moliensis after the name of the scribe, as tradition has it.

==== Beuron numbers ====

The [[Beuron Archabbey|Beuron]] Ancient Latin Institute (''Vetus Latina Institut'') has introduced a new numerical system for Old Latin manuscripts, of which there are about 90 altogether. These ''Beuron numbers'' are designed to provide unambiguous identification of witnesses in academic usage, yet they are not used very widely in general literature, as they may cause confusion with the Greek minuscule manuscripts.

Beuron Institute allocated numbers up to 100 to all existing Old Latin manuscripts, depending on what parts of NT they include, and how old their text is. The lowest numbers are allocated to the gospels, and to the most complete manuscripts. For example, Codex Bezae (d) is a witness for the Gospels (Gosp), the [[Book of Acts]] and the [[General epistles]] (Gen), and is allocated number 5.
* Manuscripts 1-49 are witnesses to one or more Gospels.
* Manuscripts 50-74 are witnesses to Acts, General epistles or the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev).
* Manuscripts 75-89 are witnesses to [[Pauline epistles]] (Paul).
* Manuscripts 91-96 are [[Bible gloss|gloss]]es in Spanish Bibles.

=== Other issues ===

NA27 and UBS4 interact with the Vulgate witness only at the level of critical editions, not at the level of manuscripts themselves. The manuscripts that provide evidence of Jerome's version are identified in the apparatus of ''Biblia Sacra Vulgata'' (the [[Vulgate#Weber-Gryson (Stuttgart) edition|Stuttgart edition of the Vulgate]]).

In practice, citation of manuscript evidence implies any of several methodologies. The ideal, but most costly, method is physical inspection of the manuscript itself; alternatively, published photographs or [[facsimile]] editions may be inspected. This method involves [[Paleography|paleographical]] analysis—interpretation of handwriting, incomplete letters and even reconstruction of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]]. More typically, editions of manuscripts are consulted, which have done this paleographical work already. The lists below note the names of the editors of standard editions of the manuscripts listed. As a last resort, sometimes a critical edition of NT, that cites readings of a manuscript in its apparatus, may be offered as authority for the text of the manuscript at these points.

It must also be observed that certain Latin NT manuscripts may present a mixture of Vulgate and Old Latin texts. For example, [[Codex Sangermanensis]] (g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ) is Old Latin in Matthew, but Vulgate in the rest of the Gospels. Also, the text of John in Codex Veronensis is believed to be part Old Latin and part Vulgate. Hence, some codices are cited as manuscript witnesses ''both'' to the Vetus Latina and to the Vulgate.

== Old Latin ==

The table below employs the following conventions.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 50 year increment.
* Content is given to the nearest book (sometimes chapter); verses and lacunae are not listed.
* Editions are those consulted by UBS4; in many cases, better editions are also available.
* Locations are given in [[anglicisation|anglicised]] form, unless linked to sources in other languages.
* Manuscripts will sometimes be referred to as "it" followed by the siglum.

This incomplete '''list of art critics''' enumerates persons who had or have a significant part of their known creative output in the form of [[art criticism]], which consists mostly of the written discussion and aesthetic evaluation of [[Work of art|works of art]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;
{{Compact ToC|seealso=yes|q=}}

==Scope==
{{main|Art critic}}
There is no official list of [[art critic]]s, the compilation of which is compounded by problems in defining [[art criticism]] – not least of which is the overlap with [[art history]],&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; and [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]]. Herein will be included those [[authors]] that are mentioned as being art critics or producing art criticism in works of reference, as are encyclopedias, dictionaries or scholarly reviews.

According to one authority, art criticism, in a close approximation to the current sociocultural framework of the activity, started in the [[18th century CE]] in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; However, many authors living before that time and outside that region of the world wrote on the subject of art and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic experience]], though using [[Philosophy of art|terms and concepts]] that may not have a direct translation into the lexicon of the [[Western culture|Western]] tradition.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; These, when mentioned, will be included as well though pertinently noted.

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

==Origins: from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance==

{{Anchor|Polykleitos}}

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===
[[File:Doryphoros MAN Napoli Inv6011-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Roman copy in marble of ''[[Doryphoros]]'', originally a bronze by [[Polykleitos]]]]
{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger. Its diagonals rotated to one side transform the square to a 1 : {{radic|2}} root rectangle. In Figure 5 this rectangular figure marks the width and length of the adjacent medial phalange. Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J. V. |title=The Invention of Infinity: Mathematics and Art in the Renaissance |date=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-852394-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Witcombe |first1=Christopher L.

The Italian painter [[Paolo Uccello]] (1397–1475) was fascinated by perspective, as shown in his paintings of ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances lie conveniently along perspective lines.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/art.html |title=Polyhedra in Art |author=Hart, George W. |authorlink=George W.

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G.

His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including [[Luca Pacioli]] in his ''De Divina Proportione'' and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heath, T.L. |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1908 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught commercial arithmetic in "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, P. |title=What Piero Learned in School: Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Education |work=Piero della Francesca and His Legacy |editor=M.A. Lavin |publisher=University Press of New England |year=1995 |pages=161–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ([[Fibonacci]])'s 1202 ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

an irrational number which is approximately 1.325.

[[Planar symmetry|Planar symmetries]] have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as [[carpet]]s, lattices, textiles and tilings.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Castera/&gt;

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that "all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.&lt;ref name=Salingaros&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salingaros, Nikos |title=The 'life' of a carpet: an application of the Alexander rules |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/life.carpet.html |journal=8th International Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Philadelphia |date=November 1996}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Eiland |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Pinner |editor2-first=M. |title=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies V |date=1998 |publisher=Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Danville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A complex relationship==
The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devlin |first=Keith |title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |page=140 |chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C |isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Octopod by syntopia.jpg|thumb|''Octopod'' by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen. [[Algorithmic art]] produced with the software ''Structure Synth'']]

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Henri Poincaré]]'s ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' was widely read by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], including [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Arthur I. |title=Insights of Genius: Imagery and Creativity in Science and Art |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=1-4612-2388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré viewed [[Euclidean geometry]] as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] inspired artists to question classical [[Perspective (graphical)#Renaissance&amp;nbsp;: Mathematical basis|Renaissance perspective]]: [[non-Euclidean geometry]] became a valid alternative.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book |author=Henderson, Linda D. |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf |author1=Antliff, Mark |author2=Leighten, Patricia Dee |title=Cubism and Culture |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to [[abstract art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Christopher |title=Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916–1928 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1987 |pages=13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |page=60}} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |publisher=Basic Books |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |pages=43–44}} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]] [[Man Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man Ray–Human Equations A Journey from Mathematics to Shakespeare.

[[File:Objet mathematique by Man Ray.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Enneper surface]]s as [[Dadaism]]: [[Man Ray]]'s 1934 ''Objet mathematique'']]
Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as his 1934 painting ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tubbs |first1=Robert |title=Mathematics in 20th-Century Literature and Art |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=978-1-4214-1380-8 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ''ForbesLife'', argues that Man Ray photographed "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of [[Kiki de Montparnasse]]", and "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keats |first1=Jonathon |title=See How Man Ray Made Elliptic Paraboloids Erotic At This Phillips Collection Photography Exhibit |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/02/13/see-how-man-ray-made-elliptic-paraboloids-sexy-at-this-phillips-collection-photography-exhibit/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 September 2015 |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century sculptors such as [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] took inspiration from mathematical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=311–312 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote of his 1938 ''Stringed Mother and Child'': "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]&amp;nbsp;...

[[File:Theo van Doesburg 122.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Theo van Doesburg]]'s ''Six Moments in the Development of Plane to Space'', 1926 or 1929]]

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[topology]] has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor [[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] (1935–2007) created works such as ''Gordian Knot'' and ''Bands of Friendship'', displaying [[knot theory]] in polished bronze.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; Other works by Robinson explore the topology of [[torus]]es.

[[File:Polittico Stefaneschi, dettaglio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Detail of Cardinal Stefaneschi holding the triptych]]

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'' (1983), was part of a series inspired by [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Elliott |editor1-last=Ades |editor1-first=Dawn |title=Dali |date=2004 |publisher=Bompiani Arte |location=Milan |pages=418–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish painter and sculptor [[Pablo Palazuelo]] (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy). This reflects Kudielka's description of her artistic development. |doi=10.1080/17513472.2012.679468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimuli to mathematical research===

{{further information|Projective geometry|Mathematics of paper folding}}

Art has sometimes stimulated the development of mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led to the work of [[Brook Taylor]] and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Treibergs |first1=Andrejs |title=The Geometry of Perspective Drawing on the Computer |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm |publisher=University of Utah |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=24 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately to the mathematics of [[projective geometry]] of [[Girard Desargues]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=xviii |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s. The mid-twentieth century [[Op art|Op art or optical art]] style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as [[Bridget Riley]]&lt;!--slight overlink seems sensible here--&gt;, Spyros Horemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=406–410 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred geometry===
{{further information|Sacred geometry|Mathematics and music}}

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mensural notation''' is the musical notation system used for European vocal [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music from the later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The term "mensural" refers to the ability of this system to describe precisely measured rhythmic durations in terms of numerical proportions between note values. Its modern name is inspired by the terminology of medieval theorists, who used terms like ''musica mensurata'' ("measured music") or ''cantus mensurabilis'' ("measurable song") to refer to the rhythmically defined polyphonic music of their age, as opposed to ''musica plana'' or ''musica choralis'', i.e., Gregorian [[plainchant]]. Mensural notation was employed principally for compositions in the tradition of vocal polyphony, whereas plainchant retained its own, older system of [[neumes|neume notation]] throughout the period. Besides these, some purely instrumental music could be written in various forms of instrument-specific [[tablature]] notation.

Mensural notation grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called [[rhythmic modes]], which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' ("The art of measured chant") by [[Franco of Cologne]] ({{nowrap|c. 1280}}). A much expanded system allowing for greater rhythmic complexity was introduced in France with the stylistic movement of the [[Ars nova]] in the 14th century, while [[Trecento music|Italian 14th-century music]] developed its own, somewhat different variant. Around 1400, the French system was adopted across Europe, and became the standard form of notation of the [[Renaissance music]] of the 15th and 16th centuries. After around 1600, mensural notation gradually evolved into modern [[bar (music)|measure]] (or bar) notation.

The decisive innovation of mensural notation was the systematic use of different note shapes to denote rhythmic durations that stood in well-defined, hierarchical numerical relations to each other. While less context dependent than notation in rhythmic modes, mensural notation differed from the modern system in that the values of notes were still somewhat context-dependent. In particular, a note could have the length of either two or three units of the next smaller order, whereas in modern notation these relations are invariably binary. Whether a note was to be read as ternary ("perfect") or binary ("imperfect") was a matter partly of context rules and partly of a system of mensuration signs comparable to modern time signatures. There was also a complex system of temporarily shifting note values by proportion factors like 2:1 or 3:2. Mensural notation used no bar lines, and it sometimes employed special connected note forms (ligatures) inherited from earlier medieval notation. Unlike in the earliest beginnings of the writing of polyphonic music, and unlike in modern practice, mensural notation was usually not written in a [[Sheet music|score]] arrangement but in individual parts.

Mensural notation was extensively described and codified by contemporary theorists. As these writings, like all academic work of the time, were usually in Latin, many features of the system are still conventionally referred to by their Latin terms.

The system of note types used in mensural notation closely corresponds to the modern system. The mensural ''brevis'' is nominally the ancestor of the modern [[double whole note|double whole note (breve)]]; likewise, the ''semibrevis'' corresponds to the [[whole note|whole note (semibreve)]], the ''minima'' to the [[half note|half note (minim)]], the ''semiminima'' to the [[Quarter note|quarter note (crotchet)]], and the ''fusa'' to the [[Eighth note|eighth note (quaver)]]. Very rarely, mensural notation also used yet smaller subdivisions, such as the ''semifusa'' (corresponding to the [[sixteenth note]] or semiquaver). On the other hand, there were also two larger values, the ''[[Longa (music)|longa]]'' (quadruple whole note or long) and the ''[[Maxima (music)|maxima]]'' (or ''duplex longa'', called a ''large'' in Britain), which are no longer in regular use today.

Despite these nominal equivalences, each note had a much shorter temporal value than its modern counterpart. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, composers repeatedly introduced new note shapes for ever smaller temporal divisions of rhythm, and the older, longer notes were slowed down in proportion. The basic metrical relationship of a long to a short beat shifted from longa–breve in the 13th century, to breve–semibreve in the 14th, to semibreve–minim by the end of the 15th, and finally to minim–semiminim (i.e., half and quarter notes, or minim and crotchet) in modern notation. Thus, what was originally the shortest of all note values used, the semibreve, has become the longest note used routinely today, the whole note.

Originally, all notes were written in solid, filled-in form ("black notation"). In the mid-15th century, scribes began to use hollow note shapes ("white notation"), reserving black shapes only for the smallest note values. This change was probably motivated by the change from [[parchment]] to paper as the most common writing material, as paper was less suited to holding large dots of ink.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the notes, the shapes of the rest symbols in mensural notation are already similar to their modern descendants (with the smaller values being successively introduced in the course of the period of mensural notation). The rest symbols of the larger values had a clear visual logic reflecting their time durations, based on the breve rest being a vertical stroke the length of one staff space. For the longa rests, a visual distinction was made depending on whether the longa was imperfect (two breves long) or perfect. Accordingly, their signs were visually twice or three times the length of a breve rest respectively, while the semibreve rest was half that length. Maxima rests, in turn, were groups of two or three longa rests combined. If several longa rests followed each other, groups of either two or three of them were written together on the same staff line to indicate whether they were supposed to be grouped into perfect or imperfect maxima units.

Ligatures are groups of notes written together, usually indicating [[melisma]]tic singing of the same syllable over several notes. Ligature forms exist only for the larger note values from the semibreve upwards. Their use in mensural notation was a holdover from the earlier [[Modal notation|modal rhythmic system]], of which they inherited some of their rhythmic meaning.

The rhythmic values of ligatures in modal notation had been based on a metric reinterpretation of the ligature [[neume]]s used since much earlier in the notation of [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian plainchant]]. In modal notation, ligatures represented stereotyped rhythmic sequences of short and long notes, typically involving groups of one or more initial short notes (i.e., breves) and one final long note (i.e., a longa). In mensural notation, this rule was generalized, with all other rhythmic combinations being classified in terms of deviation from this basic pattern. In medieval terminology, a ligature possessed ''perfectio'' ("perfection")&lt;ref&gt;Note that the term "perfection" is here used in a different sense than that of the ternary versus binary note durations. Whether any breve or longa in a ligature was itself of perfect or imperfect duration was a matter independent of the ligature forms.&lt;/ref&gt; if its final note was a longa (L), and it had ''proprietas'' ("its [normal] property") if its first note was a breve (B).&lt;ref&gt;Eggebrecht 1991: 152f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, a note pair of B–L ''(cum proprietate et cum perfectione)'' could be written with the most basic of ligature shapes, those inherited from plainchant, namely the descending ''[[clivis]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature descending BL black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in descending order, connected with a vertical stroke and with a second vertical downward stroke on the left]]) and the ascending ''[[podatus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BL black 1.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right]]). Likewise, three-note groups of B–B–L could be written with some of the inherited ternary neumes, such as the ''[[porrectus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black porrectus.svg|x20px]], direction down–up), the ''[[torculus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black torculus.svg|x20px]], direction up–down), or the ''[[scandicus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black scandicus.svg|x20px]], direction up–up).

If, by way of exception, the first note was to be a longa, this was signaled by a reversal of its visual "property", namely the use of initial stems: the descending clivis had its downward stem removed ([[File:Mensural ligature descending LL black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in descending order, connected with a vertical stroke]]), while, conversely, the ascending podatus had one added to it ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending LL black 1.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right, with a descending stroke on the left]] or [[File:Mensural ligature ascending LL black 2.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right, with a descending stroke on the right]]).

On the other hand, if the final note was to be a breve ''(sine perfectione)'', this was signaled by a change in the noteheads themselves: the descending sequence of square heads was replaced with a single diagonal beam ([[File:Mensural ligature descending BB black.svg|x20px|alt=black downward rhomboid with a descending stroke on the left]]), while the ascending podatus had its second note folded out to the right ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BB black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in ascending order connected by a vertical stroke]]). Both sequences correspond to the initial B–B segments of the ternary porrectus and torculus respectively.

If both exceptions co-occurred ''(sine proprietate et sine perfectione)'', both graphical alterations were combined accordingly.

In addition to sequences of longa and breve, ligatures could also contain pairs of semibreves (but not normally a single one).&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 100 mentions some rare exceptions&lt;/ref&gt; These were called ''cum opposita proprietate'', and always marked by an upward-pointing stem to the left of the note pair.

There were also some alternate versions of the ascending ligatures. Thus, the basic ascending B–L podatus shape was replaced by one where the second note was both folded out to the right and marked with an extra stem ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BL black 2.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in ascending order, connected with a vertical stroke and with a second vertical downward stroke on the right]]), as if these two modifications were meant to cancel each other out.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The ascending L–L ''(sine proprietate)'' was modified accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Some rare variants also existed for ascending ligatures with a final breve ''(sine perfectione)'', involving a reversed form of the descending oblique stroke, either with or without an initial stem ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending oblique white 1.svg|x20px]][[File:Mensural ligature ascending oblique white 2.svg|x20px]]). However, contemporary theorists could not agree which of these two was supposed to be the B–B and which the L–B version (Apel 1962: 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligatures could contain any number of notes. In multi-note ligatures, the rules about initial and final values are applied in analogy to those in the binary forms. In addition, the following rules hold for notes in all positions:&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Any notehead with an upward stem to its left is the first of a pair of semibreves ''(cum opposita proprietate)''.
*Any medial notehead with a downward stem to its right is a longa.
*A prolonged, double-width notehead with or without a downward stem to its right is a maxima.
*Any other notehead not covered by any of the rules above is a breve.

Mensural notation distinguished between several basic metric patterns of a piece of music, which were defined as combinations of ternary and binary subdivisions of time on successive hierarchical levels and roughly correspond to modern [[bar (music)|bar]] structures. The division of the semibreve into minims was called ''prolatio'', that of the breve into semibreves was called ''tempus'', and that of the longa into breves was known as ''modus''. The division of the maxima into longas was called ''modus maximarum'' or ''modus maior''; in the modern literature it is also sometimes called ''maximodus''. Each of these levels could be either perfect (ternary) or imperfect (binary). The two types of prolatio were also known as "major prolation" and "minor prolation" respectively.

The perfect modus and maximodus became rare in practice after the 14th century. Of most practical importance were the subdivisions from the breve downwards, as by that time the semibreves rather than the breves had taken over the function of the basic counting unit. The four possible combinations of tempus and prolatio could be signaled by a set of mensuration signs at the beginning of a composition: a circle for tempus perfectum, a semicircle for tempus imperfectum, each combined with a dot for prolatio maior, or no dot for prolatio minor. These correspond to modern measures of {{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|6|8}}, and {{music|time|2|4}} respectively (assuming a reduction factor of 1:4 in transcription, i.e., mapping mensural minims to modern quavers), or alternatively {{music|time|9|4}}, {{music|time|3|2}}, {{music|time|6|4}} and {{music|time|2|2}} respectively (with a reduction factor of 1:2). In each case, one breve corresponds to one modern bar. In addition, each of these basic patterns had a diminished (''diminutum'') variant, indicated by a vertical stroke through the sign ([[File:Tempus perf prol mai dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus perf prol min dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus impf prol mai dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]]). These so-called "cut signs" indicated a reduction of all temporal values by a factor of two. (The signs [[File:Tempus impf prol min.svg|x22px]] and [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]] are the source of the modern "[[common time]]" and "[[alla breve]]" signatures {{music|common-time}} and {{music|cut-time}} respectively.) A reversed semicircle [[File:Tempus impf rev.svg|x22px]] was usually understood to be the same as [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]].

There were normally no special signs for indicating the higher divisions of modus and maximodus. However, groups of longa rests at the beginning of a piece (which occurred frequently, as often some voices in a polyphonic composition would enter later than others) could be used as an indicator of the intended meter. If longa rests were written across three staff spaces, they were perfect; moreover, if they occurred in groups of three written together on the same staff line they indicated perfect maximodus. Occasionally, if no voice happened to have a sufficiently long rest at the beginning of the piece, a dummy rest symbol of one maxima's worth of longae would be written to the left of the mensuration sign; in that case it was understood as part of the time signature and not actually executed as a rest.

==Imperfection and alteration==

The time value of some notes could change according to their immediate context in certain situations. The rules for this were developed on the basis of the typical rhythmic nature of medieval music in the 13th century. Most of this music followed the same basic metric pattern, which in modern notation would be written as a swift {{music|time|6|4}} (or {{music|time|6|8}}) meter.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 242f.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, melodies consisted mainly of ternary long notes (in modern notation, dotted minims), or alternating sequences of binary long notes and short notes (minims and crotchets), or groups of three short notes. In the 13th century, all of these were notated using only the longa and breve notes. A longa was automatically understood to fill a whole ternary metric group whenever it was in the neighborhood of other notes that did the same, i.e., whenever it was followed either by another longa or by a full group of three breves. When, however, the longa was preceded or followed by a single breve, then both filled a ternary group together. Thus, the longa had to be reduced to a value of two (it was "imperfected"). When, finally, there were only two breves in between two longae, then the two breves had to fill up a metrical group together. This was done by lengthening the second breve ''(brevis altera)'' to a value of two, while the first ''(brevis recta)'' kept its normal value.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dufay Ave Regina cantus.svg|thumb|right|400px|Upper voice of "Ave Regina" by [[Guillaume Dufay]], a mid-15th century piece in largely homophonic tempus perfectum. Arrows are added to indicate imperfection of breves by subsequent semibreves and alteration in pairs of semibreves. Breves marked with a blue cross are perfect. Note the separator dots in the second line, enforcing a syncopated rhythm on the Sb groups. ([[:File:Dufay Ave Regina.pdf|Full score]]; {{audio|Dufay Ave Regina.ogg|listen}})]]

At the earliest stage, this basic principle applied only to the relation between longa and breve. Beginning with [[Franco of Cologne]], the same pattern was also applied between breves and semibreves,&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 344.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, with [[Philippe de Vitry]]'s theory of the [[Ars nova]], it was taken yet another level down, to the newly introduced minims. From that time onwards, imperfection and alteration could happen on the level of breves and semibreves whenever the piece was in tempus perfectum, and it could happen between semibreves and minims if the piece was in prolatio maior. The divisions below the minim were invariably binary. Theorists developed an intricate set of precedence rules for when and how to apply imperfection, together with a complex terminology for its different types.&lt;ref&gt;The following overview is based on Apel 1962: 115–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, a note was imperfected by one of the next smaller order, e.g., a breve (B) by a semibreve (Sb), and thereby lost one third of its own nominal value (ex. [a–c]). This was called "full imperfection" ''(imperfectio ad totum)''. It could be induced either backwards (''a parte post''), or forwards (''a parte ante'', ex. [c]). If both readings were possible, backwards imperfection took precedence. The smaller unit could also be replaced by a group of yet smaller notes of equivalent length, e.g., a semibreve's worth of minims or semiminims (ex. [d]). Imperfection could also apply recursively, for instance with an Sb imperfecting a preceding B and being itself imperfected by a following minim (ex. [e]), if the meter was suitable (e.g., tempus perfectum and prolatio maior).

Imperfection typically occurred if two larger notes were separated by a single smaller unit, as in a sequence of B–Sb–B–Sb. If, however, they were separated by a group of either two or three of the smaller units, there was no imperfection: in the case of two, alteration was applied instead (ex. [f]); while in the case of three the group was simply left to fill the space of a perfect unit by themselves (ex. [g]). If, in turn, there was a longer sequence of four or more smaller units before the next longer value, then the first of them induced imperfection (ex. [h]). Imperfection was barred on any note that was followed directly by another of the same order ''(similis ante similem perfecta)''. Thus, the middle part of a sequence like [[File:Mensural alteration modern.svg|x25px|alt=dotted half + quarter + half + dotted half in modern 3/4 time]] could only be written using alteration (as shown in ex.[f]); the use of imperfection like in ex.(c) was excluded, because the presence of the subsequent breve blocked it.

The normal reading of the groups could be overridden by placing a separator dot ''(punctus divisionis)'' between the notes to indicate which of them were meant to form a ternary unit together (ex. [i]). If the separator dot was placed after a potentially ternary note (e.g., a breve in tempus perfectum), it typically had the effect of keeping it perfect, i.e., overriding an imperfection that would otherwise have applied to it. In these cases it was also called ''punctus perfectionis''. Besides this, a dot could also be used in the same way as today: when it was placed after a note that was nominally binary (e.g., a breve in tempus imperfectum), it augmented it by one half ''(punctus augmentationis)''.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 122–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations, imperfection could be induced not by a note of the next smaller order but by an even smaller one. For instance, a breve in prolatio maior, which could be thought of as being composed of two perfect semibreves, could be imperfected by an adjacent minim, taking away one third of one of its two halves, thus reducing its total length from 6 to 5 (ex.[j]). This was called "partial imperfection" ''(imperfectio ad partem)''. Imperfection involving note values two orders apart (e.g., a breve by a minim, or a longa by a semibreve) was called "imperfection of an immediate part" ''(ad partem propinquam)''; while the (rarer) case where it occurred across even greater distances (e.g., between a longa and a minim) was known as "imperfection of a remote part" (''ad partem remotam'', ex. [k]). Finally, partial imperfection could also apply from both sides of a long note at once (''ad partes'', ex [l–m]). In this way, a note that was nominally 9 beats long could be reduced to any value down to 4, or a note that was 12 beats long to any value down to 7.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 118, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rests, unlike notes, had an invariable duration and could not be imperfected or altered; however, they could induce imperfection or alteration on a neighboring note.

==Proportions and colorations==

An individual composition was not limited to a single set of tempus and prolatio. Meters could be shifted in the course of a piece, either by inserting a new mensuration sign, or by using numeric proportions. A "3" indicates that all notes will be reduced to one-third of their value; a "2" indicates double tempo; a fraction "{{sfrac|3|2}}" indicates three in the time of two, and so forth. The proportion 2 is usually understood to have the same effect as the use of a cut sign with a vertical stroke ([[File:Tempus impf prol min duplum.svg|x22px]] = [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]]).

The use of numeric proportions can interact with the use of different basic mensurations in fairly complex ways. This has led to a certain amount of uncertainty and controversy over the correct interpretation of these notation devices, both in contemporary theory and in modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Busse Berger 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of altering the metrical value of notes was coloration. This refers to the device of literally marking a note as rhythmically exceptional by writing it in a different color. In the earlier period, when normal notes were black, the exceptional ones were written in red, or sometimes hollow. In the later period, the practice was reversed; as the normal notes were now hollow, the exceptional ones were filled out in black. In either case, "colored" notes are understood to have {{frac|2|3}} of their normal duration, and are always imperfect with respect to their next smaller sub-divisions.

Coloration applied to a group of breves (ex. [a]) was known as ''color temporis'', while that of a group of semibreves (ex. [b–c]) was called ''color prolationis''. The resulting rhythmic effect, as expressed in modern notation, differs somewhat according to whether the affected notes were normally perfect or imperfect according to the basic mensuration of the music. Applied to perfect notes (ex. [a–b]), coloration creates the effect of a [[hemiola]]: three binary rhythmic groups in the space normally taken up by two ternary ones, but with the next smaller time units (semibreves in [a], minims in [b]) remaining constant. When applied to notes that were already imperfect according to their normal values (ex. [c]), coloration results in the effect of a group of triplets, with all rhythmic units reduced by two thirds.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 134f.&lt;/ref&gt; Another special form of coloration was that applied to a group of a single semibreve and a following minim, called ''minor color'' (ex. [d]). Whereas it would logically be expected to result in a triplet group ([[File:Figure rythmique noire croche en triolet.svg|x20px]]), it was instead conventionally executed as a dotted group equivalent to a dotted minim and a semiminim (note that in the context of white notation, the colored – i.e., blackened – version of the minim in the ''minor color'' group happened to look just like a normal semiminim [[File:Black mensural minim.svg|x20px]] anyway, even though nominally it was considered a different type of note.)&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of colored notes (at that time written in red) was introduced by Philippe de Vitry and flourished in the so-called [[ars subtilior]] of the late 14th century.

The example above, the chanson "Belle, bonne, sage" by [[Baude Cordier]], written in a heart-shaped manuscript, is a rhythmically complex piece of [[ars subtilior]]. It uses several notation techniques for shifting between rhythms:&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 482f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*red notes: diminution {{frac|2|3}}
*shift to ''prolatio maior'': here with implied augmentation minim→semibreve
*white notes: diminution {{frac|1|2}} (two breves in the time of one)
*proportion "3": diminution {{frac|1|3}}
*proportion "{{sfrac|8|9}}": eight notes in the time of nine notes of the preceding bar

===Mensural canons===
Sometimes, music was written in such a way that the same line of music had to be performed under two or more mensuration schemes, typically leading to slower (augmented) and faster (diminished) versions of the same passage. In such cases, the music was typically notated only once, and several different mensuration signs were placed in front of it together, often supplemented with a verbal instruction of how it should be executed (called a "canon").

This technique could be applied both successively and simultaneously. Successive mensural canons were a characteristic feature of late 14th and early 15th century [[isorhythmic motet]]s. A famous example is ''[[Nuper rosarum flores]]'' by [[Guillaume Dufay]], where the tenor (notated all in longa and a few breve values) is performed first as tempus perfectum ({{music|time|3|2}}), then tempus imperfectum ({{music|time|2|2}}), then tempus imperfectum diminutum ({{music|time|2|4}}), and finally tempus perfectum diminutum ({{music|time|3|4}}), leading to length relations of 6:4:2:3 between the four repetitions.

Pieces that demanded simultaneous execution of versions of the same music, i.e., [[Prolation canon|contrapunctal canons]], were written by several composers of the [[Franco-Flemish school]] in the late 15th and early 16th century, such as [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]] or [[Pierre de la Rue]]. Ockeghem's ''[[Missa prolationum]]'' is famous for systematically exploring different ways of combining pairs of voices in mensural canons. In the example given below, from the first "Kyrie" of this mass, both upper voices sing the same notated line, one reading it as "tempus imperfectum" and the other as "tempus perfectum". The two lower voices are similarly coupled with each other. Each of the four voices thus starts the piece in a different mensuration, leading to different bar length in the modern transcription. (The lower voices, which are written in prolatio maior, later shift to a meter where all semibreves are imperfected through black coloration, which means they end up having the same length as those of the upper voices after all.)

==Pitch notation==

Whereas the rules of notating rhythm in Mensural notation were in many ways different from the modern system, the notation of [[pitch (music)|pitch]] already followed much the same principles. Notes were written on [[staff (music)|staves]] of five (sometimes six) lines, prefixed with [[clef]]s, and could be altered by [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s.

===Clefs===
[[File:Clef ranges.svg|thumb|right|377px|Clefs and their typical voice ranges]]
Mensural notation generally uses C and F [[clef]]s, on various lines. G-clefs, while used infrequently throughout the period,  did not come into completely routine use until the later 16th century. Clefs were generally chosen to match the vocal range of a given voice, so as to avoid the need of [[ledger line]]s. Since [[middle C]] lies within that range for most voices, the C-clef is the one most frequently used. For mixed voices, a typical combination of clefs would have the bass clef ([[f (musical note)|F]] on the fourth staff line) in the lowest voice, and tenor clef, alto clef and soprano clef ([[middle C]] on the fourth, third, and first staff line respectively) in the remaining voices. An alternative arrangement, known as ''[[chiavette]]'', had the range of each voice shifted one third up, leading to a combination of F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clefs.

Clefs originally bore shapes more or less closely resembling the letter they represented, but came to develop more ornamental shapes over time. In the F-clef, the two arms of the "F" were changed into two dots sitting to the right of a vertical stem. All three elements could be further modified; in particular, they were often styled as if they were note heads. The C-clef remained a simple, often square, "C"-like shape in most manuscripts, but its arms tended to become hollow rectangles or [[rhomboid]]s in later manuscripts and especially in music prints of the 16th century. The G-clef developed a curved ornamental [[swash (typography)|swash]] typically attached to the top of the letter, which ultimately evolved into the loop shape of the modern form.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidentals===

The use of [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] in medieval and renaissance music differs significantly from modern practice. Medieval notation used two accidental signs, the "[[b molle]]" ([[File:B molle.svg|x20px]]) and the "[[b durum]]" ([[File:B durum.svg|x20px]]). While the former was identical in form to the modern [[flat (music)|flat]] sign ({{music|flat}}), the latter could be written in forms that resemble either the modern [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{music|sharp}}) or the modern [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{music|natural}}), but these functions were not distinguished from each other as they are today. The ''b molle'' served to pick out the lower of two alternative semitone steps for a given note (e.g., a B{{music|flat}} as opposed to a B{{music|natural}}), while the ''b durum'' served to pick out the higher one (e.g., B{{music|natural}} as opposed to B{{music|flat}}, but also F{{music|sharp}} as opposed to F{{music|natural}}, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Apel|first=Willi|encyclopedia=Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1970|article=accidentals}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings of both signs thus overlaps with that of the natural sign today. Until the 16th century, only the flat signs regularly occurred as [[key signature]]s at the beginning of a staff (one or at most two flats).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Apel|first=Willi|encyclopedia=Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1970|article=key signature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knighton|first1=Tess|last2=Fallows|first2=David|title=Companion to Medieval and Renaissance Music|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both forms of accidentals could occur as temporary accidentals elsewhere; however, in practice they were often not written but left to the performer to infer according to the rules of [[counterpoint]] and [[musica ficta]].

==Miscellaneous symbols==

Mensural notation may contain a number of other symbols.

===Custos===

The custos (pl. custodes) appears at the end of the staff on or between the staff lines. It indicates the pitch of the first note that occurs on the following staff that belongs to that part relative to the clef of the current staff. This helps performers to prepare to sing the next note. If the next staff for the part occurs on the following page, two custodes may appear immediately next to each other.

===Corona===

The corona appears above the last note of the piece (or section). It is similar to the [[fermata]] in modern notation. It typically appears above the last note at each part of a piece to indicate the note should be held longer that its value indicates. If it does not appear at the end of a piece, typically a short pause is expected before proceeding with the notes after the note with the corona.

===Signum Congruentiae===

The signum congruentiae indicates the position of entry of another voice. This is used to denote [[Canon (music)|canons]]. Instead of writing out all parts, only one part is written out. The signum congruentiae indicates that when the previous part has progressed up to the point where the signum congruentiae appears, the next part should enter (from the start).

There is some variation in the way signum congruentiae are denoted.

==History==

The most important early stages in the historical development of mensural notation are the works of [[Franco of Cologne]] ({{nowrap|c. 1260}}), [[Petrus de Cruce]] ({{nowrap|c. 1300}}), and [[Philippe de Vitry]] (1322). Franco, in his ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'', was the first to describe the relations between maxima, longa and breve in terms that were independent of the fixed patterns of earlier [[rhythmic mode]]s. He also refined the use of semibreves: while in earlier music, one breve could occasionally be replaced by two semibreves, Franco described the subdivision of the breve as ternary (perfect), dividing it either into three equal or two unequal semibreves (resulting in predominantly triplet rhythmic micro-patterns.)

Petrus de Cruce introduced subdivisions of the breve into even more short notes. However, he did not yet define these as separate smaller hierarchy levels (minim, semiminim etc.), but simply as variable numbers of semibreves. The exact rhythmic interpretation of these groups is partly uncertain. The technique of notating complex groups of short notes by sequences of multiple semibreves was later used more systematically in the notation of [[Music of the Trecento|Italian Trecento]] music.

The decisive refinements that made notation even of extremely complex rhythmic patterns on multiple hierarchical metric levels possible were introduced in France during the time of the [[Ars nova]], with [[Philippe de Vitry]] as the most important theoretician. The Ars nova introduced the shorter note values below the semibreve; it systematicized the relations of perfection and imperfection across all levels down to the minim, and it introduced the devices of proportions and coloration.

During the time of the [[Franco-Flemish]] school in [[Renaissance music]], use of the French notation system spread throughout Europe. This period brought the replacement of black with white notation. It also brought a further slowing down of the duration of the larger note values while introducing even more new small ones (fusa, semifusa etc.). Towards the end of this period, the original rules of perfection and imperfection became gradually obsolescent, as did the use of ligatures. During the 17th century, the system of mensuration signs and proportions gradually developed into the modern time signatures, and new notation devices for time measurements, such as bar lines and ties, were introduced, thus ultimately leading towards the modern notation system.

==Modern use==

[[File:Josquin Domine ne in furore.svg|thumb|right|350px|Beginning of a modern score of a Renaissance piece, [[Josquin des Prez|Josquin]]'s "Domine, ne in furore", showing the use of mensural incipits and [[mensurstrich]] layout. ([[:File:Josquin Domine ne in furore.pdf|Full score]]; {{audio|Josquin Domine ne in furore.mid|listen}})]]
Today, music from the mensural period is normally transcribed into modern notation for performance or study, using a modern score layout, bar lines and often a modernized choice of clefs. A number of special editorial conventions for such transcriptions are common, especially in scholarly editions, where it is desirable that the basic characteristics of the original notation should be recoverable from the modern text.

While 19th and early 20th century editions of Renaissance music often preserved the large note values of the originals, including breves and longs, most modern editions will use scaled-down note values in order to match modern reading habits regarding tempo and beat structure. For 16th century music, a frequent scheme is diminution by a factor of 2 (i.e., rendering semibreves as modern minims), in a modern ''alla breve'' bar. Older music might be diminished by a factor of 4 (rendering semibreves as crotchets) or sometimes 8 (rendering breves as crotchets). For 13th-century pieces, diminution by 16 (rendering breves as quavers) is also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Julie E.|last=Cumming|chapter=Motet and cantilena|editor-last=Duffin|editor-first=Ross W.|title=A Performer's Guide to Medieval Music|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2000|pages=55, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 15th and 16th century music, bar divisions are usually chosen to match the time of a breve, while 14th century Ars nova pieces may be written in measures the length of a longa, and 13th century music in measures the length of a maxima.

To account for these editorial changes, scholarly editions often print a brief notation fragment in the original form in front of each staff at the beginning of a piece, called an "incipit", including the original clefs, mensuration signs, accidentals, and often the first few notes.&lt;ref&gt;Grier 1996: 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, an annotation defining the mapping scheme may be provided over the staff, e.g., "[[File:White mensural semibrevis.svg|x20px|alt=semibreve]]={{music|halfnote}}".

Where ligatures occur in the original text, this is conventionally marked by square brackets over the transcribed notes, while the use of coloration is sometimes marked by broken brackets (⌜...⌝). Flats or sharps that are not written in the original but suggested by the editor are typically indicated by placing them above the note rather than in front of it.

A special issue in representing Renaissance music is how to deal with its characteristic free-flowing rhythms, where modern bar lines can seem to overly highlight what is part of the natural articulation points of the melodic units. To avoid the excessive use of [[tie (music)|ties]] and to allow for a notation more closely reflecting the original, some editions will print bar lines not across the staves, but only in the intermediate spaces between them (a convention sometimes referred to by the German term ''[[Mensurstrich]]''), allowing notes to be read as lasting across a bar line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Werner|last=Breig|chapter=Die Editionsgeschichte der ''Geistlichen Chormusik'' von Heinrich Schütz|editor-first=Helga|editor-last=Lühning|title=Musikedition: Mittler zwischen Wissenschaft und musikalischer Praxis|location=Tübingen|publisher=Niemeyer|year=2002|pages=237–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grier 1996: 165f.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15794">'''Misattribution of arousal''' is a term in [[psychology]] which describes the process whereby people make a mistake in assuming what is causing them to feel [[arousal|aroused]]. For example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to [[fear]], people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal. The reason physiological symptoms may be attributed to incorrect stimuli is because many stimuli have similar physiological symptoms such as increased [[blood pressure]] or [[shortness of breath]].

One of the initial studies looking into this phenomenon conducted by Schachter and Singer (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based on the idea that the experience of arousal could be ambiguous and therefore misattributed to an incorrect stimulus. Operating under this assumption, the researchers developed the [[two factor theory of emotion]]. Misattribution of arousal, which is an influence on emotion processing, can be found in multiple situations, such as romantic situations and physiological responses from exercise.

An example of the possible effects of misattribution of arousal is perceiving a potential partner as more attractive because of a heightened state of physiological stress. A study done by White et al. (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=G|last2=Fishbein|first2=S|last3=Rutsein|first3=J|title=Passionate love and the misattribution of arousal|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=41|pages=56–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated this phenomenon and found that those in an unrelated aroused state will rate an attractive confederate more highly than a rater without arousal. The researchers also found that aroused raters would dislike an unattractive confederate more than those without arousal.

== Initial demonstration ==

=== Experiment ===
[[Donald Dutton]] and [[Arthur Aron]]'s  (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutton|first1=D.G.|last2=Aaron|first2=A. P.|title=Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1974|volume=30|issue=4|pages=510–517|doi=10.1037/h0037031|pmid=4455773}}&lt;/ref&gt; study to test the causation of misattribution of arousal incorporated an attractive confederate female to wait at the end of a bridge that was either a suspension bridge (that would induce fear) or a sturdy bridge (that would not induce fear). After the males crossed the bridge, they were stopped by a female confederate and took a [[Thematic Apperception Test]] wherein they had to compose a short story based on an ambiguous image; the image chosen was purposefully not sexual at all. Afterward, the story was analyzed for sexual content. The female confederate, who was not aware of the true hypothesis of the experiment, then gave her phone number to the males if they had any more questions about the experiment and the researchers documented how many males called the confederate. As the men finished the survey, the woman explained she would be available to answer any questions regarding her project, giving her [[phone number]] and name to the male subjects. Dutton and Aron wondered if the participants were more likely to call the woman because they were physically attracted to her or not. However, Dutton and Aron had to take into consideration that some factors of the men, such as the possibility of some men already being involved in a relationship or how an individual male interpreted the woman's body gestures.
Therefore, Dutton and Aron had the woman survey the men under two conditions:  immediately after they crossed a {{convert|450|ft|m|sing=on}}-long bridge or after they had crossed and had enough time to rest. In the first condition, the men who were surveyed during their cross over the bridge would have had their arousal level increased as they were speaking to the woman. Conditions such as experiencing winds during their walk and the nervous feeling may have contributed to their fast-paced [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]s and rapid [[breathing]].

In the other condition, the woman had approached the men after they had crossed the bridge. They had enough time to rest and get their heartbeat and breathing back to normal.

=== Results ===
More males contacted the female experimenter when they had just walked down the suspension bridge, which was thought to be due to their misattribution of their arousal (they believed that they were feeling sexual arousal at the sight of the female instead of feeling the leftover physiological arousal from the fear of walking across the suspension bridge). This was interpreted by the researchers to mean that the men found the woman more attractive when they had more anxiety about crossing the bridge. There were no significant differences on either bridge when the researchers used a male confederate to give the Thematic Apperception Test and his phone number for any further questions about the experiment.

== Subsequent research ==

=== Experiment: expansion on initial demonstration ===

Fear is not the only emotion that can be a result of misattribution of arousal. One of the earlier studies that focused on misattribution of arousal was done by Schachter and Singer in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers told the participants in their study that they were testing how their vision responded to a shot of vitamins called Suproxin. Suproxin was actually a shot of epinephrine or a placebo. Epinephrine activated the sympathetic nervous system and produced systems such as an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The researchers then either told the participants the effects of the epinephrine, said nothing about any potential effects of the epinephrine, or told them they may feel some effects that had nothing to do with the epinephrine (for example, the researchers told the participants they could experience a headache from the shot). The participants were told that they had to wait 20 min for the Suproxin to get into their bloodstreams. While they were waiting, a confederate (a participant who is also covertly collaborating with/an associate of the researchers) who was either euphoric or angry waited with the participant to see if the emotion of the participant could be manipulated by the epinephrine and the emotion of the confederate. The confederate played basketball with pieces of balled up scrap paper while in the euphoric state or had to take a questionnaire and became very angry with the personal questions in the anger state.The participants then were observed to see if they appeared to be angry or euphoric and took a self-reported survey about their mood.

They found that if someone was physiologically aroused without being aware of it, they would attribute their arousal to a recent thought in their memory.The researchers also found that emotions (in this study, euphoria and anger) could be manipulated by providing a participant with a shot of epinephrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: influence on confidence ===

Misattribution of arousal can also influence how much confidence one feels before completing a task. One study conducted by Savitsky, Medvec, Charlton, and Gilovich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitsky|first1=K|last2=Medvec|first2=V|last3=Charlton|first3=A|last4=Gilovich|first4=T|title=What, me worry?' Arousal, misattribution and the effect of temporal distance on confidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1177/0146167298245008}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on how confidence can be affected by misattribution of arousal. Typically people feel more confident before they are supposed to do a task, but the closer they get to having to perform that task, the less confident they feel, which could be due to the arousal from the expectation of the performance. The researchers told participants that they would be exposed to a subliminal noise and were then asked if they could predict how well they would do on two tasks. After they made their predictions, the researchers either told them that the noise could make them nervous, the noise would have no effect on them, or they were told that they would not have to do the tasks until the next session a month away after they were exposed to the noise. The tasks were to unscramble anagrams or to recall as many nonsense syllables as they could after seeing them briefly. They could earn money for the tasks (more money was earned for each anagram unscrambled or each syllable correctly recalled). The participants then predicted how well they did on the tasks, and how well they believed everyone else did on the task. A second experiment replicated this first experiment.The researchers had participants attribute their arousal to noises that they heard, which resulted in those participants feeling more confident that they did well on the tasks than those that attributed their arousal to the performance anxiety from the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitsky|first1=K|last2=Medvec|first2=V|last3=Charlton|first3=A|last4=Gilovich|first4=T|title='What, me worry?' Arousal, misattribution and the effect of temporal distance on confidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1177/0146167298245008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: polarity ===
White, Fishbein, and Rutsein generated further research on the misattribution of arousal with their 1981 study, “Passionate Love and the Misattribution of Arousal.” The researchers performed their study using two experiments. In the first experiment, 54 male participants were placed under varying degrees of physical exertion, in order to create a state of arousal. The participants were then asked to view a video of a female confederate either manipulated to be attractive or unattractive. The video was a self-disclosure statement where the female discussed hobbies and other typically dating related material. After completing the video, participants were given thirteen attraction trait criteria on which to rate the female. The experiment confirmed the researcher's hypothesis that individuals in a neutral aroused state were more likely to rate a target as attractive than an unaroused individual.
White, Fishbein, and Rutsein hypothesized that the polarity of an individual's arousal could influence the impact of the misattribution of arousal. To test this hypothesis the researchers created three separate videos to prime the subjects with a positive, negative, or neutral arousal. Sixty six male participants were asked to watch one of the videos and then rate the female as in the first study. The study found that regardless of the stimuli's polarity, the participants in the aroused state found the attractive confederate more attractive and the unattractive confederate as less attractive than the unaroused participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=G|last2=Fishbein|first2=S|last3=Rutsein|first3=J|title=Passionate love and the misattribution of arousal|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=41|pages=56–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: conditional emotional responses ===

A study done by Loftis and Ross in 1974 looked at the effects of misattribution of arousal upon acquisition and extinction of a conditional emotional response. They conducted two experiments with 89 female undergraduates to show that misattribution procedures can alter physiological response to a conditioned source of a fear or arousal. The results suggested that self perception and attribution play a major role in emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftis|first=Jack|author2=Ross|title=Effects of misattribution of arousal upon the acquisition and extinction of a conditioned emotional response|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=November 1974|volume=30|issue=5|pages=673–682|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/614269444/|doi=10.1037/h0037414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: alternate model ===

Additionally, a study conducted by Allen, Kenrick, Linder and McCall in 1989 suggested an alternative explanation to the misattribution of arousal in terms of attraction-arousal (as there are other types of arousal that can be misattributed). The original model of misattribution of arousal essentially states that the person who is aroused will only be attracted to the target person, so long as they are unaware of the true cause of arousal.  Allen et al. propose a different model called Response-Facilitation, in which they suggest that the subject that is aroused will be more attracted to the target person (compared to people who are unaroused), regardless of if they know the true source of the stimulation. To test this new model, they ran two studies in which they manipulated the type of arousal the participants experienced and the salience (awareness) of the arousal. In one study, they put the participants into three different groups: control (no arousal), arousal-awareness (where they were put in front of an attractive person, but knew what the actual cause of arousal (exercise) was), and arousal-unaware (where they were put in front of an attractive person but didn't realize the true cause of arousal). After conducting the study, the researchers found that regardless of whether the person was aware of the true cause of arousal, they were still more attracted to the target person than those in the control condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=J|last2=Kenrick|first2=D|last3=Linder|first3=D|last4=McCall|first4=M|title=Arousal and attraction: A response-facilitation alternative to misattribution and negative-reinforcement models|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|issue=2|pages=261–270|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whereas the original theory of misattribution of arousal said that people could only misattribute their arousal if they were unaware of the true cause, the Response-Facilitation model states that it is possible that people could be aware of the true cause of arousal and still find themselves attracted to someone, compared to people who are unaroused.  This demonstrates another potential model that could explain the attraction-arousal component of the misattribution of arousal theory.

The '''monsoon of South Asia''' is among several geographically distributed [[monsoon|global monsoon]]s. It affects the [[Indian subcontinent]], where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated [[weather]] phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from June through September, but it is only partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin, process, strength, variability, distribution, and general vagaries of the monsoon, but understanding and predictability are still evolving.

The unique [[Geography of India|geographical features of the Indian subcontinent]], along with associated [[atmospheric]], [[ocean]]ic, and [[geophysical]] factors, influence the behavior of the monsoon. Because of its effect on [[agriculture]], on [[flora and fauna]], and on the climates of nations such as [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Sri Lanka]] — among other [[economic]], [[social]], and [[Natural environment|environmental]] effects — the monsoon is one of the most anticipated, tracked,&lt;ref name="Frater2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Frater|title=Chasing the Monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5I7AAme3yfUC|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Picador|isbn=978-0-330-43313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied weather phenomena in the region.

==Definition==
The word ''monsoon'' (derived from the Arabic "mausam," meaning "season"), although generally defined as a system of [[winds]] characterized by a seasonal reversal of direction,&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt; lacks a consistent, detailed definition. Some examples are:

* The [[American Meteorological Society]] calls it a name for seasonal winds, first applied to the winds blowing over the [[Arabian Sea]] from the northeast for six months and from the southwest for six months.&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=monsoon&amp;submit=Search|title=Monsoon|accessdate=2008-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322122025/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=monsoon&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=22 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been extended to similar winds in other parts of the world.
* The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) describes a monsoon as a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both surface winds and associated [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], caused by differential heating between a continental-scale land mass and the adjacent ocean.&lt;ref name=IPCCdef&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007, Glossary|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/annex1sglossary-e-o.html|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Indian Meteorological Department]] defines it as the seasonal reversal of the direction of winds along the shores of the [[Indian Ocean]], especially in the Arabian Sea, which blow from the southwest for half of the year and from the northeast for the other half.&lt;ref name=IMDdef&gt;{{cite web|title=IMD terminologies &amp; glossary|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Colin Stokes Ramage, in ''Monsoon Meteorology'', defines the monsoon as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation.&lt;ref name="Ramage1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin S. Ramage|title=Monsoon meteorology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YA1ezydaPecC|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1971|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-576650-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

* [[Bay of Bengal]] branch
[[File:Monsoon season beach Tamil Nadu India.jpg|thumb|200px|Southwest monsoon clouds over [[Tamil Nadu]].]]
Alternatively, it can be categorized into two ''segments'' based on the direction of rain-bearing winds:
* Southwest (SW) monsoon 
* Northeast (NE) monsoon&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The name of the wind is based on the direction that it blows ''from''. Southwest winds blow onto the land from the southwest. Northeast winds flow from the northeast toward the southwest, onto the land.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the time of year that these winds bring rain to India, the monsoon can also be categorized into two ''periods'':
* Summer monsoon (May to September)
* Winter monsoon (October to November)

The complexity of the monsoon of South Asia is not completely understood, making it difficult to accurately predict the quantity, timing, and geographic distribution of the accompanying precipitation. These are the most monitored components of the monsoon, and they determine the water availability in India for any given year.&lt;ref name=IMD1/&gt;

==Changes of the Monsoon==

{{Main article|Monsoon#South Asian Monsoon}}

[[File:Aug2011monsoon.JPG|Monsoon over India|thumb|350px]]
Monsoons typically occur in tropical areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Class 9 CBSE Geography Climate The Mechanism of Monsoons - Wiki|url = http://www.learnnext.com/nextgurukul/wiki/concept/CBSE/IX/Geography/The-Mechanism-of-Monsoons.htm|website = www.learnnext.com|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area that monsoons impact greatly is India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In India monsoons create an entire season in which the winds reverse completely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various atmospheric conditions influence the monsoon winds. The first condition is the differential heating and cooling of land and water. This creates low pressure on the landmass, while high pressure is created over the seas during daytime, but is reversed during the night time.

The second condition is the shift in the position of [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ). In summer, the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°N of the equator moves over the Ganga plain creating a monsoon trough during the monsoon season.

The third condition is the presence of the high-pressure area that develops east of Madagascar. It is approximately at 20°S over the Indian Ocean. The intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the Indian Monsoon.

The fourth condition develops during the summer. The Tibetan Plateau gets intensely heated resulting in strong vertical air currents and high pressure over the plateau about 9&amp;nbsp;km above sea level. The fifth condition develops during the summer due to the movement of the westerly jet streams to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian Peninsula.

Changes in pressure over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons. In certain years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions. This periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the Southern Oscillation, or SO.

The Southern Oscillation is connected to la nina, which is a warm ocean current that flows past the Peruvian Coast. It flows every two to five years in place of the cold Peruvian current. The phenomenon is, referred to as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations). In India, the monsoon lasts for 100 to 120 days from early June and to mid-September. The monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature, and not steady.

The monsoon arrives with a sudden downpour of rainfall that continues for several days. This is known as the ‘burst’ of the monsoon.

The rainfall is a result of the convergence of wind flow from the [[Bay of Bengal]] and reverse winds from the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/onset onset] of the monsoon occurs over the [[Bay of Bengal]] in May,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Characteristics, evolution and mechanisms of the summer monsoon onset over Southeast Asia|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1082/abstract|journal = International Journal of Climatology|date = 2004-10-01|issn = 1097-0088|pages = 1461–1482|volume = 24|issue = 12|doi = 10.1002/joc.1082|language = en|first = Zuqiang|last = Zhang|first2 = Johnny C.

By mid-October, it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula. The withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of December to the first week of January. This is the start of the winter season.

The retreating monsoon winds move over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and collect moisture on the way. These monsoon winds reach the southern states of India by October, and are responsible for a second round of rainfall. These are called the winter monsoons. The winter monsoon is experienced in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in the first week of January.

===Effect of geographical relief features===
Although the southwest and northeast monsoon winds are seasonally reversible, they do not cause precipitation on their own.
{{Main article|Rain#Formation}}
Two factors are essential for [[Rain#Formation|rain formation]]:
# [[Rain#Water-saturated air|Moisture-laden winds]]
# [[Rain#Coalescence|Droplet formation]]

Additionally, one of the [[Rain#Causes|causes of rain]] must happen. In the case of the monsoon, the cause is primarily [[Rain#Orographic effects|orographic]], due to the presence of highlands in the path of the winds. Orographic barriers force wind to rise. Precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic cooling]] and condensation of the moist rising air.
{{Main article|Orographic lift}}

The unique [[Geography of India|geographic relief]] features of the Indian subcontinent come into play in allowing all of the above factors to occur simultaneously. The relevant features in explaining the monsoon mechanism are as follows:
# The presence of abundant water bodies around the subcontinent: the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], and [[Indian Ocean]]. These help moisture accumulate in the winds during the hot season.
# The presence of abundant highlands like the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Himalayas]] right across the path of the southwest monsoon winds. These are the main cause of the substantial [[Orographic lift#Precipitation|orographic precipitation]] throughout the subcontinent.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]] Mountains also lie in the path of the southwest monsoon but do not result in much precipitation because they are in the direction of the path of the southwest winds and not ''across'' them, causing no [[orographic lift]] of the winds.&lt;/ref&gt;
## The Western Ghats are the first highlands of India that the southwest monsoon winds encounter.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Other major highlands, like the [[Cardamom Hills]], [[Anaimalai Hills]], and [[Nilgiri Mountains]], that play active roles in the monsoon are considered major extensions of the Western Ghats and are thus not discussed separately.&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Ghats rise abruptly from the [[Western Coastal Plains]] of the subcontinent, making effective orographic barriers for the monsoon winds.
## The Himalayas play more than the role of orographic barriers for the monsoon. They also help confine it to the subcontinent. Without them, the southwest monsoon winds would blow right over the Indian subcontinent into [[Tibet]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Russia]] without causing any rain.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;First, the Himalayas serve as orographic barriers to the southwest monsoon winds. Second, they help confine the winds to the subcontinent, hampering their northward progress. Third, they contribute to the convergence of the Bay of Bengal branch and Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon winds, increasing the intensity of precipitation over the northern part of the subcontinent. Fourth, they are a major factor in the ''bursting'' of the monsoon under the jet stream theory. Fifth, they help determine the direction of the Bay of Bengal branch of the northeast monsoon. Their role is still a matter of active study, and understanding of them is evolving regularly.&lt;/ref&gt;
## For the northeast monsoon, the highlands of the [[Eastern Ghats]] play the role of orographic barrier.

==Features of monsoon rains==
There are some unique features of the rains that the monsoon brings to the Indian subcontinent.

===''"Bursting"''===
[[File:Mumbai india monsoon clouds.jpg|thumb|220px|"Monsoon burst" over [[Mumbai]].]]
''Bursting of monsoon'' refers to the sudden change in weather conditions in India (typically from hot and dry weather to wet and humid weather during the southwest monsoon), characterized by an abrupt rise in the mean daily rainfall.&lt;ref name="Allaby2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Allaby|title=Encyclopedia of weather and climate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1wq-9OSCscC&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4801-4|pages=373–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanif2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

===Rain variability (''"vagaries"'')===
One of the most commonly used words to describe the erratic nature of the monsoon is "vagaries," used in newspapers,&lt;ref name=IEvag&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasabe|first=Nanda Dabhole|title=Vagaries apart, monsoon is normal|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970723/20450243.html|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=the Indian Express|date=23 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazines,&lt;ref name="Darpan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Pratiyogita Darpan]]|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT93|accessdate=5 March 2011|date=October 2007|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; books,&lt;ref name="Krishnamacharyulu2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krishnamacharyulu|title=Cases In Rural Marketing: An Integrated Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4_mXbVC4bwC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=5 March 2011|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-0188-1|pages=106–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[web portal]]s&lt;ref name=IWP&gt;{{cite web|title=Agronomic Measures in Dryland Agriculture: An Overview|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/node/6979|publisher=India Water Portal|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[insurance]] plans,&lt;ref name=FT1&gt;{{cite news|title=Weather Insurance To Protect A Few|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/printer/news/110251/|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=Financial Express|date=16 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India's budget discussions.&lt;ref name=MI1&gt;{{cite news|title=Budget must focus on Growth, Food Inflation, FDI, Govt B/s: G Chokkalingam|url=http://www.myiris.com/newsCentre/storyShow.php?fileR=20110222154315043&amp;dir=2011/02/22&amp;secID=livenews|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=myIris.com|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some years, it rains too much, causing floods in parts of India; in others, it rains too little or not at all, causing droughts. In some years, the rain quantity is sufficient but its timing arbitrary. Sometimes, despite average annual rainfall, the daily distribution or geographic distribution of the rain is substantially skewed. In the recent past, rainfall variability in short time periods (about a week) were attributed to desert dust over the Arabian Sea and [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n4/full/ngeo2107.html|title=Short-term modulation of Indian summer monsoon rainfall by West Asian dust|first1=V.|last1=Vinoj|first2=Philip J.|last2=Rasch|first3=Hailong|last3=Wang|first4=Jin-Ho|last4=Yoon|first5=Po-Lun|last5=Ma|first6=Kiranmayi|last6=Landu|first7=Balwinder|last7=Singh|date=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=7|issue=4|pages=308–313|accessdate=20 April 2018|doi=10.1038/ngeo2107|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..308V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal and normal monsoon rains==
[[File:India annual rainfall map en.svg|thumb|200px|Annual average rainfall in India.]]

Normally, the southwest monsoon can be expected to "burst" onto the western coast of India (near [[Thiruvananthapuram]]) at the beginning of June and to cover the entire country by mid-July.&lt;ref name=IMD1&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Meteorological Department|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|publisher=imd.gov.in|accessdate=3 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224191959/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|archivedate=24 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDMOK&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Onset Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/MOK.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon Onset dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/newnormalonset.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its withdrawal from India typically starts at the beginning of September and finishes by the beginning of October.&lt;ref name=IMDwith&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Withdrawal Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_criteria.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDwithjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon withdrawal dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_normal.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northeast monsoon usually "bursts" around 20 October and lasts for about 50 days before withdrawing.&lt;ref name="Wang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bin Wang|title=The Asian monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRT57TENzT8C&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-40610-5|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a rainy monsoon is not necessarily a normal monsoon — that is, one that performs close to [[statistical average]]s calculated over a long period. A normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the ''average quantity'' of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence (''mean spatial distribution'') and over the entire expected time period (''mean temporal distribution''). Additionally, the ''arrival date'' and the ''departure date'' of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates. The exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the [[Indian Meteorological Department]] with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables.&lt;ref name=IMDavgMonsoon&gt;{{cite web|title=Met. Terminologies and Glossary - Monsoon|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=[[Indian Meteorological Department]]|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A monsoon with excess rain can cause floods, and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought, [[famine]], and economic losses. Therefore, a normal monsoon with mean performance is the most desirable monsoon.

==Theories for mechanism of monsoon==
Theories of the mechanism of the monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timing of their reversal.

===Traditional theory===
{{Main article|Sea breeze}}
Because of differences in the [[specific heat capacity]] of land and water, [[continents]] heat up faster than [[sea]]s. Consequently, the [[air]] above [[coast]]al lands heats up faster than the air above seas. These create areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as [[sea breeze]].

====Process of monsoon creation====
{{Main article|Monsoon#Process}}
[[File:Diagrama de formacion de la brisa-breeze.svg|thumb|200px|A: sea breeze; B: land breeze.]]
Also known as the ''thermal theory'' or the ''differential heating of sea and land theory'', the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale [[sea breeze]]. It states that during the hot subtropical summers, the massive [[landmass]] of the [[Indian Peninsula]] heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas, resulting in a [[pressure gradient]] from south to north. This causes the flow of moisture-laden winds from sea to land. On reaching land, these winds rise because of the geographical relief, cooling [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatically]] and leading to orographic rains. This is the ''southwest monsoon''.
The reverse happens during the winter, when the land is colder than the sea, establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea. This causes the winds to blow over the Indian subcontinent toward the [[Indian Ocean]] in a northeasterly direction, causing the ''northeast monsoon''. Because the southwest monsoon flows from sea to land, it carries more moisture, and therefore causes more rain, than the northeast monsoon. Only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the Bay of Bengal picks up moisture, causing rain in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] during the winter months.

However, many meteorologists argue that the monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory, but a general weather phenomenon along the entire [[Tropics|tropical zone]] of [[Earth]]. This criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds, but casts it as one of several factors rather than the only one.

===Dynamic theory===
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.svg|thumb|300px|The atmospheric circulation system with associated pressure belts and latitudes.]]
{{Main article|Prevailing winds}}
{{Main article|Atmospheric circulation}}
The [[prevailing winds]] of the [[atmospheric circulation]] arise because of the difference in pressure at various [[latitudes]] and act as means for distribution of [[thermal energy]] on the planet. This pressure difference is because of the differences in [[solar insolation]] received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the [[planet]]. Alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the [[equator]], the two [[tropics]], the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] circles, and the two [[polar region]]s, giving rise to the [[trade wind]]s, the [[westerlies]], and the [[polar easterlies]]. However, geophysical factors like [[Earth's orbit]], its rotation, and its [[axial tilt]] cause these belts to shift gradually north and south, following the [[Sun]]'s seasonal shifts.

====Process of monsoon creation====
The ''dynamic theory'' explains the monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds. According to this theory, the monsoon is a result of the shift of the [[Inter Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) under the influence of the [[Solar equator|vertical sun]]. Though the mean position of the ITCZ is taken as the equator, it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the Tropics of [[Tropic of Cancer|Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]] during the [[summer]] of the respective hemispheres ([[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]). As such, during the northern summer (May and June), the ITCZ moves north, along with the vertical sun, toward the Tropic of Cancer. The ITCZ, as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region, is the target destination for the [[trade wind]]s of both hemispheres. Consequently, with the ITCZ at the Tropic of Cancer, the southeast trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;When the southeast trade winds cross the equator, they are perceived in the Northern Hemisphere as equatorial westerlies because they seem to blow from the equator toward the Tropic Of Cancer. Similarly, when the ITCZ is at the Tropic of Cancer, the northeast trade winds are confined to the area north of the Tropic of Cancer.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the [[Coriolis effect]] (which causes winds in the Northern Hemisphere to turn right, whereas winds in the Southern Hemisphere turn left), these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], transforming into southwest trades.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Change of direction or origin of winds alters their nomenclature as noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; These pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the Indian Peninsula. This results in the southwest monsoon.

The dynamic theory explains the monsoon as a global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one. And when coupled with the traditional theory (based on the heating of sea and land), it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with orographic barriers.

===Jet stream theory===
{{Main article|Jet stream}}
[[File:Jetcrosssection.jpg|thumb|300px|Jet streams of Earth]]
This theory tries to explain the establishment of the northeast and southwest monsoons, as well as unique features like "bursting" and variability.

The jet streams are systems of upper-air westerlies. They give rise to slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250-[[knots|knot]] winds in some air streams. First observed by [[World War II]] pilots, they develop just below the [[tropopause]] over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the ''polar jets'', the ''subtropical westerly jets'', and the less common ''tropical easterly jets''. They follow the principle of [[geostrophic wind]]s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Geostrophic winds blow parallel to the [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobars]] and keep low-pressure zones to their left in the Northern Hemisphere and to their right in the Southern Hemisphere. The reversal is a result of the [[Coriolis effect]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process of monsoon creation====
[[File:Tibet Karte Topograpisch.png|thumb|250px|The [[Tibetan Plateau]] lies north of the [[Himalayas]].]]
Over India, a subtropical westerly jet develops in the winter season and is replaced by the tropical easterly jet in the summer season. The high temperature during the summer over the [[Tibetan Plateau]], as well as over [[Central Asia]] in general, is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the tropical easterly jet over India.

The mechanism affecting the monsoon is that the westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter. This results in the north-to-south flow of the winds in the form of the northeast monsoon. With the northward shift of the vertical sun, this jet shifts north, too. The intense heat over the Tibetan Plateau, coupled with associated [[terrain]] features like the high altitude of the plateau, generate the tropical easterly jet over central India. This jet creates a low-pressure zone over the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|northern Indian plains]], influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}.

==Theories for "bursting"==
The "bursting"&lt;ref name=Allaby2002/&gt; of the monsoon is primarily explained by the jet stream theory and the dynamic theory.

===Dynamic theory===
According to this theory, during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ shifts north, pulling the southwest monsoon winds onto the land from the sea. However, the huge landmass of the Himalayas restricts the low-pressure zone onto the Himalayas themselves. It is only when the Tibetan Plateau heats up significantly more than the Himalayas that the ITCZ abruptly and swiftly shifts north, leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the Indian subcontinent.
The reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds, leading to a second, minor burst of rainfall over the eastern Indian Peninsula during the Northern Hemisphere winter months.

===Jet stream theory===
According to this theory, the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of India toward the Tibetan Plateau. This shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months. The northward shift is not a slow and gradual process, as expected for most changes in weather pattern. The primary cause is believed to be the height of the Himalayas. As the Tibetan Plateau heats up, the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north. Because of the lofty Himalayas, the westerly jet's movement is inhibited. But with continuous dropping pressure, sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the Himalayas after a significant period. As such, the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt, causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the Indian plains. The reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon.

==Theories for monsoon variability==

===The jet stream effect===
The jet stream theory also explains the variability in timing and strength of the monsoon.

'''Timing:''' A timely northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet at the beginning of summer is critical to the onset of the southwest monsoon over India. If the shift is delayed, so is the southwest monsoon. An early shift results in an early monsoon.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Strength:''' The strength of the southwest monsoon is determined by the strength of the easterly tropical jet over central India. A strong easterly tropical jet results in a strong southwest monsoon over central India, and a weak jet results in a weak monsoon.

===El Niño-Southern Oscillation effect===
{{Main article|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}
[[File:El Nino regional impacts.png|thumb|righ|300px|Effects of [[El Niño]] on the weather of the subcontinent.]]
[[El nino|''El Niño'']] is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of [[Peru]] that replaces the usual cold [[Humboldt Current]]. The warm surface water moving toward the coast of Peru with El Niño is pushed west by the trade winds, thereby raising the temperature of the southern Pacific Ocean. The reverse condition is known as [[La Niña]].

''Southern oscillation'', a phenomenon first observed by [[Gilbert Walker|Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker]], director general of observatories in India, refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between [[Tahiti]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia.&lt;ref name=IODhindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopal Raj|first=N|title=El Nino &amp; the Indian Ocean Dipole|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2004050401861000.htm&amp;date=2004/05/04/&amp;prd=th&amp;|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that when pressure was high in Tahiti, it was low in Darwin, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]].&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;  A ''Southern Oscillation Index'' (SOI), based on the pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, has been formulated by the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] to measure the strength of the oscillation.&lt;ref name="Aus"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|title=Climate glossary - Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/glossary/soi.shtml|date=3 April 2007|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the Indian subcontinent was often negligible in years of high pressure over Darwin (and low pressure over Tahiti). Conversely, low pressure over Darwin bodes well for precipitation quantity in India. Thus, Walker established the relationship between southern oscillation and quantities of monsoon rains in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

Ultimately, the southern oscillation was found to be simply an atmospheric component of the El Niño/La Niña effect, which happens in the ocean.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Therefore, in the context of the monsoon, the two together came to be known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect. The effect is known to have a pronounced influence on the strength of the southwest monsoon over India, with the monsoon being weak (causing droughts) during El Niño years, while La Niña years bring particularly strong monsoons.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

===Indian Ocean dipole effect===
{{Main article|Indian Ocean Dipole}}
Although the ENSO effect was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in India, in recent decades, its relationship with the Indian monsoon seemed to weaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=K.

Cane |title=On the Weakening Relationship Between the Indian Monsoon and ENSO|journal=Science|date=25 June 1999|volume=284|issue=5423|pages=2156–2159|doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2156|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5423/2156.abstract|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the strong ENSO of 1997 did not cause drought in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; However, it was later discovered that, just like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean, a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere system in the [[Indian Ocean]] was also in play. This system was discovered in 1999 and named the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD). An index to calculate it was also formulated. IOD develops in the equatorial region of the Indian Ocean from April to May and peaks in October.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; With a positive IOD, winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west. This makes the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near the African coast) much warmer and the eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia colder and drier.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; In negative dipole years, the reverse happens, making Indonesia much warmer and rainier.

A positive IOD index often negates the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983, 1994, and 1997.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Further, the two poles of the IOD — the eastern pole (around Indonesia) and the western pole (off the African coast) — independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon rains.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

====Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation====
As with ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD was later discovered and the cumulative phenomenon named ''Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation'' (EQUINOO).&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; When EQUINOO effects are factored in, certain failed forecasts, like the acute drought of 2002, can be further accounted for.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; The relationship between extremes of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, along with ENSO and EQUINOO,&lt;ref name=EQgadgil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|author2=P.

==Impact of climate change on the monsoon==

Since 1950s, the South Asian summer monsoon underwent a gradual decline, with a reduction of up to 10% over central India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=Mathew Koll|last2=Ritika|first2=Kapoor|last3=Terray|first3=Pascal|last4=Murtugudde|first4=Raghu|last5=Ashok|first5=Karumuri|last6=Goswami|first6=B.

Since the strength of the monsoon is partially dependent on the temperature difference between the ocean and the land, higher ocean temperatures in the Indian Ocean have weakened the moisture bearing winds from the ocean to the land. The reduction in the summer monsoon rainfall have grave consequences over central India because at least 60% of the agriculture in this region is still largely [[Rainfed agriculture|rain-fed]]. 

A recent assessment of the monsoonal changes indicate that the land warming has increased during 2002-2014, possibly reviving the strength of the monsoon circulation and rainfall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=Mathew Koll|date=|title=Land warming revives monsoon|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nclimate3356|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=7|issue=8|pages=549–550|doi=10.1038/nclimate3356|via=|bibcode=2017NatCC...7..549R}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Future changes in the monsoon will depend on a competition between land and ocean—on which is warming faster than the other.

Meanwhile, there has been a three-fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events during the years 1950 to 2015, over the entire central belt of India, leading to a steady rise in the number of flash floods with significant socioeconomic losses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=M.

Widespread extreme rainfall events are those rainfall events which are larger than 150 mm/day and spread over a region large enough to cause floods.

==Monsoon rain prediction models==
Since the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]] in India, various attempts have been made to predict monsoon rainfall.&lt;ref name=MOL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.tropmet.res.in/~kolli/mol/Introduction/frameindex.html|publisher=Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, India|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least five prediction models exist.&lt;ref name="CSgadgil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|date=10 February 2011|year=|title=Seasonal prediction of the Indian monsoon|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/100/03/0343.pdf|journal=Current Science|series=3|volume=100|pages=343–353|via=|author2=J.

===Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon (SPIM)===

The department has tried to forecast the monsoon for India since 1884,&lt;ref name=MOL1/&gt; and is the only official agency entrusted with making public forecasts about the quantity, distribution, and timing of the monsoon rains. Its position as the sole authority on the monsoon was cemented in 2005&lt;ref name=CSgadgil/&gt; by the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology (DST)]], [[New Delhi]].

==Significance==
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 May in dry season]]
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 August in rainy season]]

The monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for [[fresh water]] in the Indian subcontinent. As such, it affects the [[Natural environment|environment]] (and associated flora, fauna, and [[ecosystem]]s), agriculture, society, hydro-power production, and geography of the subcontinent (like the availability of fresh water in water bodies and the underground water table), with all of these factors cumulatively contributing to the health of the economy of affected countries.

The monsoon turns large parts of India from semi-deserts into green grasslands. See photos taken only three months apart in the Western Ghats.

===Geographical (wettest spots on Earth)===
[[Mawsynram]] and [[Cherrapunji]], both in the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]], alternate as the wettest places on Earth given the quantity of their rainfall,&lt;ref name=Wettest&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip|first=A J|title=Cherrapunji no longer wettest Challenge comes from nearby village|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030824/main8.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011|newspaper=The Tribune|date=24 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there are other cities with similar claims. They receive more than 11,000 millimeters of rain each from the monsoon.

===Agricultural===
In India, which has historically had a primarily agrarian economy, the [[services sector]] recently overtook the [[farm sector]] in terms of [[GDP]] contribution. However, the [[agriculture]] sector still contributes 17-20% of GDP&lt;ref name=Rediff1&gt;{{cite web|title=How monsoon impacts the Indian economy|url=http://business.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/jun/02/slide-show-1-how-monsoon-impacts-indian-economy.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest employer in the country, with about 60% of Indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; About 49% of India's land is agricultural; that number rises to 55% if associated [[wetlands]], [[dryland farming]] areas, etc., are included. Because more than half of these farmlands are rain-fed, the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life.

Despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation, agricultural dependence on the monsoon remains far from insignificant. Therefore, the agricultural calendar of India is governed by the monsoon. Any fluctuations in the time distribution, spatial distribution, or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts, causing the agricultural sector to suffer. This has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors, the overall economy, food inflation, and therefore the general population's quality and cost of living.

===Economic===
The economic significance of the monsoon is aptly described by [[Pranab Mukherjee]]'s remark that the monsoon is the "real finance minister of India".&lt;ref name="HT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNlive1/&gt;
A good monsoon results in better agricultural yields, which brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces imports, thus reducing [[food inflation]] overall.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; Better rains also result in increased hydroelectric production.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;
All of these factors have positive ripple effects throughout the economy of India.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;

The down side however is that when monsoon rains are weak, crop production is low leading to higher food prices with limited supply.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monsoon affects economy, health in India|url = http://monsoon.yale.edu/monsoon-affects-economy-health-in-india/|website = WORLD MONSOONS|access-date = 2016-02-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Indian government is actively working with farmers and the nation's meteorological department to produce more drought resistant crops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Social===
[[D. Subbarao]], [[List of Governors of the Reserve Bank of India|former governor of the Reserve Bank of India]], emphasized during a quarterly review of India's [[monetary policy]] that the lives of Indians depend on the performance of the monsoon.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{cite news|last=IANS|title=All Indians ‘chasing the monsoon’|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/all-indians-chasing-the-monsoon_100402650.html|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=Thaindia.com|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own career prospects, his emotional well-being, and the performance of his monetary policy are all "a hostage" to the monsoon, he said, as is the case for most Indians.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; Additionally, farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities. This crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city life.&lt;ref name=IEtme&gt;{{cite news|last=MITRA|first=SUBHANKAR|title=The monsoon effect|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-monsoon-effect/508510/0|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=IndianExpress|date=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
In the past, Indians usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons. But with the advent of globalization, such travel is gaining popularity. Places like [[Kerala]] and the Western Ghats get a large number of tourists, both local and foreigners, during the monsoon season. Kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] treatments and massage therapy. One major drawback of traveling during the monsoon is that most wildlife sanctuaries are closed. Also, some mountainous areas, especially in Himalayan regions, get cut off when roads are damaged by landslides and floods during heavy rains.&lt;ref name=ift&gt;{{cite web|title=Traveling in India during monsoons|url=http://indiafoodtour.com/traveling-in-india-during-monsoons|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
The monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to the area. The [[Geography of South India#Water bodies|peninsular/Deccan rivers of India]] are mostly rain-fed and non-perennial in nature, depending primarily on the monsoon for water supply.&lt;ref name=IG&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers-Profile-Know India|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php|publisher=India.gov.in|accessdate=6 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204154938/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php |archivedate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the [[List of rivers of India#Rivers flowing into Arabian Sea|coastal rivers of Western India]] are also rain-fed and monsoon-dependent.&lt;ref name=IG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Geography|url=http://www.indiabook.com/india-information/indian-geography.html|publisher=IndiaBook.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the flora, fauna, and entire [[ecosystem]]s of these areas rely heavily on the monsoon. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7975">'''Multilingual Education''' typically refers to "first-language-first" education, that is, schooling which begins in the mother tongue and transitions to additional languages.  Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed  world.

== Components of Multilingual Education (MLE) ==

* '''"Strong Foundation"''' - Research shows that children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education ([https://archive.is/20040627111339/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/resource/effectiveness/ Thomas and Collier, 1997]).  For more information about the effect of "Language of Instruction", see [[Bilingual education]].
* '''"Strong Bridge"''' - an essential difference between MLE programs and rural "mother tongue education" programs is the inclusion of a guided transition from learning through the mother tongue to learning through another tongue.

Related to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered "non-standard" and making active use of them in the classroom.  Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.

== Stages of an MLE Program  ==

A widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages:

# '''Stage I''' - learning takes place entirely in the child's home language
# '''Stage II''' - building fluency in the mother tongue.  Introduction of oral L2.
# '''Stage III''' - building oral fluency in L2. Introduction of literacy in L2.
# '''Stage IV''' - using both L1 and L2 for lifelong learning.

MLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a "two-way" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education.

Based  on the  theories of  Multilingual Education  that are spelled out  here, Andhra Pradesh  and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach  to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has  provided a space to the tribal children of  Orissa  and Andhra Pradesh to rediscover their culture through their language. The Multilingual  Education  in this approach  emphasizes  first  language first  in the  child  taking  the  socio- cultural curriculum  in to classroom  culture  and   then  bridge  to  second  language.
In addition to the  basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian  theory on education,  Lev  Vigostky's scaffolding  and Piaget's  theory  of cognition is applied in the  Multilingual Education. The unique  thing in  this  approach is to  involve the community   in creating their  own  curriculum  and  minimise the  theoretical hegemony, thereby  creating  a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating  and  sharing knowledge for the society than to  limit  it to the  theoreticians.
 
===Multilingual Education in Odisha===
  
Odisha  is a multilingual state having  more than  40  ethnic language  among the 62  scheduled tribes, along with the   Modern  Indian  Languages like  Hindi, Bengali and  Telugu. To   address  the  language-  education of  ethnic minorities  children in  schools, Odisha government  started  Multilingual Education programme,ten tribal languages. Led by  Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra, as the  Director of Multilingual Education  and   guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and  Prof Khageswar  Mahapatra, the eminent multilingual  Experts, the state   government  started  MLE  programme in te tribal languages in 547  schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora,  Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang, Bonda  and   Ho.  Culturally responsive curriculum  and text books were prepared for class i to   Class  V  to maintain  mother tongue based multilingual education to   educate the  tribal children.  State government appointed  teachers from the same language community in  the schools  to  teach the tribal children.A language policy was also formulated. The programme  was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson  and Vicky Simpson, Pamela Mackenzie.  The curriculum and text books were prepared by the   tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups.  It was initiated in  2005  and  isnow  running in   2250 schools  with majority tribal children.  This  is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries.About  7  Asian countries have  visited the  MLE schools. 
 Dr Mahendra  Kumar Mishra, started  MLE programme in Chhatishgarh adopting  Durua  language  in  MLE programme.

'''Music theory''' is the study of the practices and possibilities of [[music]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first is what is otherwise called '[[Elements of music|rudiments]]', currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on. [...] The second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards. [...] The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music — a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fallows|first1=David|title=Theory|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e6759.|website=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=11 September 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see [[Definition of music]]), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of "music" in the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice.&lt;ref&gt;See Boethius's ''De institutione musica'', in which he disdains "musica instrumentalis" as beneath the "true" musician who studies music in the abstract: ''Multo enim est maius atque auctius scire, quod quisque faciat, quam ipsum illud efficere, quod sciat'' ("It is much better to know what one does than to do what one knows").&lt;/ref&gt; However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, chapters 4–7 of Christensen, Thomas (2002). ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts [[composers]] and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from [[Music of ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Chinese Music|China]],{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc=15–17}} and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see [[History of music]] and [[Musical instrument]]). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.

In modern academia, music theory is a subfield of [[musicology]], the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, ''music theory'' is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle.{{sfn|OED|2005}} As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists. 1. Definitions}} A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] or [[Ph.D]] level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of [[musical acoustics]], considerations of [[musical notation]], and techniques of tonal [[Musical composition|composition]] ([[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]]), among other topics.

==History==

===Prehistory===
{{Main article|Prehistoric music}}

Preserved prehistoric instruments, artifacts, and later depictions of performance in artworks can give clues to the structure of pitch systems in prehistoric cultures. See for instance [[Paleolithic flutes]], [[Gudi (instrument)|Gǔdí]], and [[Anasazi flute]].

===Antiquity===

====Mesopotamia====
{{see also|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Several surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mirelman|2010}}; {{harvnb|Mirelman|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wulstan|1968}}; {{harvnb|Kümmel|1970}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer|1971}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer and Mirelman|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, "All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years."{{sfn|Mirelman|2013|loc=43–44}}

====China====
{{see also|Music of China|Chinese musicology}}

Much of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"&gt;Joseph S.C. Lam, "China.", §II, "History and Theory", ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed November 15, 2015, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43141pg2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest texts about Chinese music theory are inscribed on the stone and bronze bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi (died 433&amp;nbsp;BCE) of the Zeng state. They include more than 2800 words describing theories and practices of music pitches of the time. The bells produce two intertwined pentatonic scales three tones apart with additional pitches completing the chromatic scale.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bagley, "The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 131, 2004 (Lectures), pp. 41–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed. The [[Lüshi chunqiu]] from about 239&amp;nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huangzhong'', the "Yellow Bell." He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the ''lülü'' or later the ''shierlü''.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

The ''lülü'' formed the ritual scale to which many instruments were tuned. The name of the lowest sound, ''huangzhong'' also implied 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations.{{sfn|Crease|2011|loc=40–41}} The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes for the construction of the musical scales themselves. The ''lülü'' also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.{{sfn|Wu and Wu|2014|loc=41–42}}

The two sets of tones (male and female) dividing the twelve-tone scale were generated by the "Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds," or ''sanfen sunyi'', which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of a third of the length of the preceding pitch pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] (91&amp;nbsp;BCE) as pitches of "superior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as pitches of "inferior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s female phoenix.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

"Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The ''Yueji'' ("Record of music", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c468–c376&amp;nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi’s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the ''qin'' zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as ''Tianfeng huanpei'' ("Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants")."&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"/&gt;

====India====
The [[Samaveda]] and [[Yajurveda]] (c. 1200 – 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but they contain no theory properly speaking. The [[Natya Shastra]], written between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE to 200&amp;nbsp;CE, discusses intervals (''Śrutis''), scales (''Grāmas''), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (''Mūrchanās'', modes?), melodic types (''Jātis''), instruments, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nāțyaśāstra, A Treatise on Hindu Dramaturgy and Histrionics, attributed to Bharata-Muni'', translated from the Sanskrit with introduction and notes by Manomohan Ghosh, vol. II, Calcutta, The Asiatic Society, 1961. See particularly pp. 5–19 of the Introduction, ''The Ancient Indian Theory and Practice of Music''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{see also|Musical system of ancient Greece|List of music theorists#Antiquity}}

Early preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen, "Greek Music Theory", ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'', Th. Christensen ed., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* technical manuals describing the Greek musical system including notation, scales, consonance and dissonance, rhythm, and types of musical compositions
* treatises on the way in which music reveals universal patterns of order leading to the highest levels of knowledge and understanding.
Several names of theorists are known before these works, including [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570 – c. 495&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Philolaus]] (c. 470 – c. 385&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Archytas]] (428–347&amp;nbsp;BCE), and others.

Works of the first type (technical manuals) include
* Anonymous (erroneously attributed to [[Euclid]]) ''Division of the Canon'', Κατατομή κανόνος, 4th–3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;English translation in Andrew Barker, ''Greek Musical Writings'', vol. 2: ''Harmonic and Acoustic Theory'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 191–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

More philosophical treatises of the second type include
* [[Aristoxenus]], ''Harmonic Elements'', Άρμονικά στοιχεία, 375/360 – after 320&amp;nbsp;BCE.
* [[Aristoxenus]], ''Rhythmic Elements'', Ρυθμικά στοιχεία.

===Middle Ages===

====China====
Some imported early Chinese instruments became important components of the entertainment music of the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581–618) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907) courts: the bent-neck [[pipa]] (quxiang pipa), the [[Guan (instrument)|bili]], the [[konghou]] and the [[jiegu]]. They generated not only new repertories and performing practices but also new music theories. The pipa, for example, carried with it a theory of musical modes that subsequently led to the Sui and Tang theory of 84 musical modes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S.C.

====Europe====
The Latin treatise ''De institutione musica'' by the Roman philosopher [[Boethius]] (written c. 500) was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the [[plainchant]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists §5 Early Middle Ages}}: "Boethius could provide a model only for that part of theory which underlies but does not give rules for composition or performance. The first surviving strictly musical treatise of Carolingian times is directed towards musical practice, the Musica disciplina of Aurelian of Réôme (9th century)."&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the ninth century, [[Hucbald]] worked towards more precise pitch notation for the [[neume]]s used to record plainchant.

[[Guido d'Arezzo]]' wrote in 1028 a letter to Michael of Pomposa, entitled ''Epistola de ignoto cantu'',&lt;ref&gt;For a modern edition of the letter, see [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/gui_epi.html].&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal [[solmization]] that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony "come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account" in the Western tradition.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}}

During the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' ("The art of measured chant") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.

As Western musical influence spread throughout the world in the 1800s, musicians adopted Western theory as an international standard—but other theoretical traditions in both textual and oral traditions remain in use. For example, the long and rich musical traditions unique to ancient and current cultures of Africa are primarily oral, but describe specific forms, genres, performance practices, tunings, and other aspects of music theory.{{sfn|Kubik|2010|loc=passim}}{{sfn|Ekwueme|1974|loc=passim}}

[[Sacred Harp]] music uses a different kind of scale and theory in practice. The music focuses around the solfege "fa, sol, la" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving "shape notes", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for "singing by note" in order to help his church members with note accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music|last=Cobb, Jr.|first=Buell E.|publisher=The University of Georgia Press Athens|year=1978|isbn=0-8203-0426-3|location=United States of America|pages=4–5, 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals of music==
{{Main article|Aspect of music}}
Music is composed of [[aural]] phenomena; "music theory" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.}}

===Pitch===
{{Main article|Pitch (music)}}
[[File:Middle C.png|thumb|Middle C (261.626&amp;nbsp;Hz) {{audio|Middle C.mid|Play}}.]]
Pitch is the lowness or highness of a [[Musical tone|tone]], for example the difference between [[middle C]] and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Specific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign [[Concert A]] (the A above [[middle C]] on the piano) to the frequency of 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435&amp;nbsp;Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.

The difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single "class" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class—the class that contains all C's. {{sfn|Bartlette and Laitz|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}

[[Musical tuning|Musical tuning systems]], or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as [[equal temperament]] is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.

===Scales and modes===
{{Main article|Musical scale| Musical mode}}
[[File:C major scale.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A pattern of whole and half steps in the Ionian mode or major scale on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]
Notes can be arranged in a variety of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[musical mode|modes]]. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a [[chromatic scale]], within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or [[semitone]]. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

The most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned [[major scale|major]], the [[harmonic minor]], the [[melodic minor]], and the [[natural minor]]. Other examples of scales are the [[octatonic scale]] and the [[pentatonic]] or five-tone scale, which is common in [[folk music]] and [[blues]]. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

In traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a [[whole tone]]. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73–74}}

The interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.

===Consonance and dissonance===
{{Main article|Consonance and dissonance}}
{{double image|right|Perfect octave on C.png|175|Minor second on C.png|175|The [[perfect octave]], a consonant interval {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}|The [[minor second]], a dissonant interval {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|Play}}|A consonance|A dissonance}}
[[Consonance and dissonance]] are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages.
Consonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and "wants to" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to greater or lesser degree.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Context and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the Common Practice era, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, [[Arnold Schoenberg]]’s concept of "emancipated" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as "higher," more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--Better would be the title of the article in this dictionary, added to the entry in the list of references, in which case a page number would be superfluous.--&gt;}}

===Rhythm===
{{Main article|Rhythm}}
[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]
Rhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] measures music in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]]. The [[time signature]] or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.

Through increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. [[Syncopation|Syncopated]] rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syncopation|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e10023|website=Oxford Dictionary of Music|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="Syncopation is achieved by accenting a weak instead of a strong beat, by putting rests on strong beats, by holding on over strong beats, and by introducing a sudden change of time‐signature."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called [[polyrhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyrhythm|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22059|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="The superposition of different rhythms or metres."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are [[Maury Yeston]],{{sfn|Yeston|1976}} [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]],{{sfn|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1985}} [[Jonathan Kramer]],{{sfn|Kramer|1988}}  and [[Justin London]].{{sfn|London|2004}}

A [[melody]] is a series of tones sounding in succession that typically move toward a climax of tension then resolve to a state of rest. Because melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.

The basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.{{sfn|Stein|1979|loc=3–47}}

===Chord===

A chord, in [[music]], is any [[harmony|harmonic]] set of three or more [[Musical note|note]]s that is heard as if sounding [[Simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]].{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=67, 359|quote=A ''chord'' is a harmonic unit with at least three different tones sounding simultaneously." "A combination of three or more pitches sounding at the same time.}}{{sfn|Károlyi|1965|loc=63|quote=Two or more notes sounding simultaneously are known as a ''chord''.}} These need not actually be played together: [[arpeggio]]s and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and [[Chord progression|sequences of chords]] are frequently used in modern Western, West African,{{sfn|Mitchell|2008}} and Oceanian{{sfn|Linkels|n.d.|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Specific page citation within this twelve-page article needed.--&gt;}} music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}}

The most frequently encountered chords are [[Triad (music)|triads]], so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may be added to give [[seventh chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s, or [[added tone chord]]s. The most [[Common chord (music)|common chord]]s are the ''[[major chord|major]]'' and ''[[minor chord|minor]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]'' and then the ''[[augmented triad|augmented]]'' and ''[[diminished triad|diminished]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]''. The descriptions ''major'', ''minor'', ''augmented'', and ''diminished'' are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal ''quality''. Chords are also commonly classed by their [[root (chord)|root]] note—so, for instance, the chord '''C''' major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note '''C'''. Chords may also be classified by [[Inverted chord|inversion]], the order in which the notes are stacked.

A series of chords is called a [[chord progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing [[Key (music)|key]] in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]]. To describe this, chords are numbered, using [[Roman numerals]] (upward from the key-note),{{sfn|Schoenberg|1983|loc=1–2}} per their [[diatonic function]]. Common ways of [[#Notation|notating or representing chords]]{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=77}} in western music other than conventional [[staff notation]] include [[Roman numerals#Music theory|Roman numerals]], [[figured bass]] (much used in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]]), [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]] (sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]), and various systems of [[chord chart]]s typically found in the [[lead sheet]]s used in [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)|popular music]] to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.

===Harmony===

In [[music]], harmony is the use of simultaneous [[pitch (music)|pitches]] ([[timbre|tones]], [[note (music)|notes]]), or [[chord (music)|chords]].{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Homophonic texture...is more common in Western music, where tunes are often built on chords (harmonies) that move in progressions. Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}} The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and [[chord progression]]s and the principles of connection that govern them.{{sfn|Dahlhaus|2009}} Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from [[melody|melodic line]], or the "horizontal" aspect.{{sfn|Jamini|2005|loc=147}} [[Counterpoint]], which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and [[polyphony]], which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[popular harmony|popular]] and [[jazz harmony]], chords are named by their [[root (chord)|root]] plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a [[lead sheet]] may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass. Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Timbre===
{{Main article|Timbre}}
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spectrogram]] of the first second of an E9 chord played on a Fender Stratocaster guitar with noiseless pickups. Below is the E9 chord audio:
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).ogg]] ]]Timbre, sometimes called "color", or "tone color," is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called "...the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,"{{sfn|McAdams and Bregman|1979|loc=34}} but can be accurately described and analyzed by [[Fourier analysis]] and other methods{{sfn|Mannell|n.d.}} because it results from the combination of all sound [[Audio frequency|frequencies]], attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.

[[Timbre]] is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of [[overtones]] produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word ''dolce'' (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and "sweet" timbre. ''Sul tasto'' instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. ''Cuivre'' instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like ''marcato'' (^) and dynamic indications (''pp'') can also indicate changes in timbre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Dynamics====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
{{Relevance inline|section|date=September 2015|reason=What has this entire section to do with theory?}}
{{Main article|Dynamics (music)}}
[[File:Music hairpins.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An illustration of hairpins in musical notation.]]
In music, "[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in [[decibels]] or [[phon]]s. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.

The conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like ''forte'' ('''''f''''') for loud and ''piano'' ('''''p''''') for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including ''mezzo piano'' ('''''mp''''') for moderately soft (literally "half soft") and ''mezzo forte'' ('''''mf''''') for moderately loud, ''sforzando'' or ''sforzato'' ('''''sfz''''') for a surging or "pushed" attack, or ''fortepiano'' ('''''fp''''') for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible ''pianissississimo'' ('''''pppp''''') to a loud-as-possible ''fortissississimo'' ('''''ffff''''').

Greater extremes of '''''pppppp''''' and '''''fffff''''' and nuances such as '''''p+''''' or ''più piano'' are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (''crescendo'') or decreasing volume (''decrescendo''), often called "[[Dynamics (music)|hairpins]]" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.

====Articulation====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
{{Main article|Articulation (music)}}
[[File:Notation accents1.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of articulation marks. From left to right: [[staccato]], [[staccatissimo]], [[martellato]], [[marcato]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--The linked article says there are two symbols commonly used to indicate "marcato": the one so indicated here, and the one that is here described as "martellato". Which authority says the latter is incorrect?--&gt; [[tenuto]].]]
Articulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, ''[[staccato]]'' is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, ''[[legato]]'' performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.

For example, ''staccato'' is often referred to as "separated" or "detached" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of ''staccato.'' The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).

There are a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: ''legato'' (smooth, connected); ''[[tenuto]]'' (pressed or played to full notated duration); ''[[marcato]]'' (accented and detached); ''staccato'' ("separated", "detached"); ''[[martelé (bowstroke)|martelé]]'' (heavily accented or "hammered"). Many of these can be combined to create certain "in-between" articulations. For example, ''[[portato]]'' is the combination of ''tenuto'' and ''staccato''. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as ''[[spicatto]]'' for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.

===Texture===
{{Main article|Musical texture}}
[[File:Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Introduction to [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]'s "[[The Washington Post (march)|Washington Post March]]," mm. 1–7{{audio|Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.mid|Play}} features [[octave doubling]] {{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|p=133}} and a homorhythmic texture.]]
In [[music]], texture is how the [[melody|melodic]], [[rhythm]]ic, and [[harmony|harmonic]] materials are combined in a [[musical composition|composition]], thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many "layers" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.

The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used.{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.{{sfn|Isaac and Russell|2003|loc=136}}

Common types included [[monophonic]] texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), [[polyphonic]] texture and [[homophonic]] texture (chords accompanying a melody).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--Especially for the drone accompaniment, which is usually regarded as a type of monophony.--&gt;

===Form or structure===

{{Main article|Musical form}}
The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.{{sfn|Brandt|2007}} In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."{{sfn|Scholes|1977}} According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musical form is "the shape or structure of the work." He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a [[Repetition (music)|repeat]]; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative: ''how far'', and ''of what type'', different. In many cases, form depends on statement and [[Restatement (music)|restatement]], unity and variety, and [[contrast (music)|contrast]] and connection.{{sfn|Middleton|1999|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}}

===Expression===
{{Main article|Musical expression}}
[[File:1Francisco20violinista.jpg|thumb|Right|220px|A violinist performing]]
Musical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.

Expression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Does this mean that keyboard and stringed instruments are essentially inexpressive?--&gt; Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable [[emotion]], ideally causing a [[emotional contagion|sympathetic emotional response]] in its listeners.{{sfn|London|n.d.}} The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a [[national anthem]]), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.{{sfn|Avison|1752|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Avison say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Christiani|1885|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Christiani say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Lussy|1892|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Lussy state there is an extensive and unresolved dispute, or indeed that there is any dispute at all?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Darwin|1913|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Darwin state that there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Sorantin|1932|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Sorantin contend that there is an extensive and unresolved dispute on thesubject?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Davies|1994|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page does Davies say the components of expression continue to be subject to unresolved dispute?

===Notation===
{{Main article|Musical notation|Sheet music}}
[[File:Tibetanmusicalscore.jpg|thumb|[[Tibet]]an musical score from the 19th century]]
Musical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.{{Sfnm|Read|1969|1loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}|Stone|1980|2loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}In the 2000s, computer [[file formats]] have become important as well.{{sfn|Castan|2009}} Spoken language and [[Kodály Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.

In standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the [[Conducting|conductor]] are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.

In Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western [[Classical music]], conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten [[chord chart]] indicating the song's [[chord progression]] using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.

==Music theory as academic discipline==
The scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.

===Analysis===
{{Main article|Musical analysis|Schenkerian analysis|Transformational theory}}
[[File:Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Typically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created. For instance, the first two bars of the prelude to [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Melisande]]''
are analyzed differently by Leibowitz, Laloy, van Appledorn, and Christ. Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I-VII-V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I-V, seeing the G in the second measure as an [[musical ornamentation|ornament]], and both van Appledorn and Christ analyses the succession as D:I-VII.
{{audio|Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.mid|Play}}]]
Musical analysis is the attempt to answer the question ''how does this music work?'' The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to [[Ian Bent]], "analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards."{{sfn|Bent|1987|loc=6}} [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as [[Edgard Varèse]]'s claim that, "to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Bernard|1981|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schenkerian analysis]] is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining [[tonality]] in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various [[Schenkerian analysis#Techniques of prolongation|techniques of elaboration]]. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of ''tonal space''.&lt;ref&gt;Schenker described the concept in a paper titled ''Erläuterungen'' ("Elucidations"), which he published four times between 1924 and 1926: ''Der Tonwille'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 8–9, pp. 49–51, vol. 10, pp. 40–2; ''Das Meisterwerk in der Musik'', {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 1, pp. 201–05; 2, p. 193-97. English translation, ''Der Tonwille'',{{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 2, p. 117-18 (the translation, although made from vols. 8–9 of the German original, gives as original pagination that of ''Das Meisterwerk'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} 1; the text is the same). The concept of tonal space is still present in {{harvtxt|Schenker|n.d.|loc=especially § 13}}, but less clearly than in the earlier presentation.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a ''tonal space'' that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.

Although Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the [[fundamental structure]] (''Ursatz'') to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the ''Ursatz'' is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise.{{sfn|Schenker|n.d.|loc=§ 21{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is ''subjective''. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst.{{sfn| Snarrenberg|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.

Transformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]] in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''. The theory, which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]], can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]]. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects—such as the "C [[major chord]]" or "G major chord"—to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been "transformed" into the second by the "[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation."  (Symbolically, one might write "Dominant(C major) = G major.")  While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, "[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'"{{sfn|Lewin|1987|loc=159}}

===Music perception and cognition===
[[File:Diana deutsch scale fig3b.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Deutsch's scale illusion]]: an [[auditory illusion]] in which two scales are presented with successive tones alternating between each ear but are perceived as simultaneous, unbroken scales.{{sfn|Bregman|1994|loc=76}}]]
{{Further information|Music psychology|Fred Lerdahl|Ray Jackendoff}}
Music psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both [[psychology]] and [[musicology]]. It aims to explain and understand [[music]]al [[behavior]] and [[experience]], including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.{{sfn|Tan, Peter, and Rom|2010|loc=2}}{{sfn|Thompson|n.d.|loc=320}} Modern music psychology is primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], [[skill]], [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], and [[social behavior]].

Music psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of [[musicology]] and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the [[perception]] and [[Cognitive musicology|computational modelling]] of musical structures such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|meter]], and [[Musical form|form]]. Research in [[music history]] can benefit from systematic study of the history of [[musical syntax]], or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. [[Ethnomusicology]] can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of [[Culture in music cognition|music cognition in different cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QCfUoD4m7E4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=Ethnomusicology+can+benefit+from+psychological+approaches+to+the+study+of+music+cognition+in+different+cultures.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S1ffy-zJ_D&amp;sig=MHHfRNiZSsLSqtelThi5cvmrZnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiezMnRypXZAhUJSY8KHVgoApcQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethnomusicology%20can%20benefit%20from%20psychological%20approaches%20to%20the%20study%20of%20music%20cognition%20in%20different%20cultures.&amp;f=false|title=Time in Indian Music: Rhythm, Metre, and Form in North Indian Rag Performance|last=Martin|first=Clayton|last2=Clayton|first2=Martin|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195339680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Genre and technique===
{{Main article|Music genre|Musical technique}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F008930-0019, Beethovenhalle Bonn, Kammerkonzert Kölner Trio.jpg|thumb|A Classical [[piano trio]] is a group that plays [[chamber music]], including [[sonata]]s. The term "piano trio" also refers to works composed for such a group.]]
A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.{{sfn|Samson|n.d.}} It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{sfn|Wong|2011}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--An electronic search of this web article finds only one occurrence of the word "form", as part of the compound expression ; the word "style" does not occur at all. As a result, this citation confirms neither the claim that genre should be distinguished from form and style, nor the claim that they are sometimes used interchangeably in practice.--&gt;

Music can be divided into different [[genres]] in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, "Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre—both are violin concertos—but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."{{sfn|Green|1979|loc=1}} Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or "basic musical language."{{sfn|van der Merwe|1989|loc=3}}

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.{{sfn|Moore|2001|loc=432–33}} A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that "since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects".{{sfn|Laurie|2014|loc=284}}

Musical technique is the ability of [[musical instrument|instrumental]] and [[Human voice|vocal]] musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or [[vocal cords]] to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the [[Natural minor|natural]], [[Minor scale|minor]], [[Major scale|major]], and [[chromatic scale]]s, [[Minor triad|minor]] and [[major triad]]s, [[Dominant seventh chord|dominant]] and [[diminished seventh]]s, formula patterns and [[arpeggio]]s. For example, [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[Seventh chord|sevenths]] teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. [[Scale (music)|Scales]] teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play [[broken chord]]s over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] era compositions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Heinrich Schenker]] argued that musical technique's "most striking and distinctive characteristic" is [[repetition (music)|repetition]].{{sfn|Kivy|1993|loc=327}} Works known as [[étude]]s (meaning "study") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.

===Mathematics===
{{Main article|Music and mathematics}}
[[Music]] theorists sometimes use [[mathematics]] to understand music, and although music has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is "the basis of sound" and sound itself "in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties", simply because nature itself "is amazingly mathematical".{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42–43}} The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=chapter 6, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Garland and Kahn|1995|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42}} the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]]){{sfn|Purwins|2005|loc=22–24}} of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s.
[[File:HarmonicIdentities.Names.Frequencies.svg|thumb|right|400px|The first 16 harmonics, their names and frequencies, showing the exponential nature of the octave and the simple fractional nature of non-octave harmonics.]]
In the modern era, musical [[set theory]] uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].{{sfn|Wohl|2005}}

===Serial composition and set theory===
[[File:Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.PNG|thumb|Tone row from [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'', mov. I. {{audio|Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.mid|Play}}]]
{{Further information|serialism|set theory (music)|Arnold Schoenberg|Milton Babbitt|David Lewin|Allen Forte}}
In music theory, serialism is a method or technique of [[Musical composition|composition]] that uses a series of values to manipulate different [[aspect of music|musical elements]]. Serialism began primarily with [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of [[atonality|post-tonal]] thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], forming a [[tone row|row]] or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's [[melody]], [[harmony]], structural progressions, and [[variation (music)|variations]]. Other types of serialism also work with [[set (music)|sets]], collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called "[[parameter (music)|parameters]]"), such as [[duration (music)|duration]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre]]. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the [[visual arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bandur|2001|loc=5, 12, 74}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964|loc=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Integral serialism" or "total serialism" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. {{sfn|Whittall|2008|loc=273}} Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post–World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are "general serialism" and "multiple serialism".{{sfn|Grant|2001|loc=5–6}}

Musical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by [[Howard Hanson]] (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as [[Allen Forte]] (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

One branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as [[Transposition (music)|transposition]], [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], and [[Complement (music)|complementation]]. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Musical semiotics===
{{Further information|music semiology|Jean-Jacques Nattiez}}
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|upright|Semiotician [[Roman Jakobson]]]]
Music semiology ([[semiotics]]) is the study of signs as they pertain to [[music]] on a variety of levels. Following [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Kofi Agawu]] adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive—that is, musical signs within a text and without.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} "Topics," or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} The notion of [[Musical Gestures|gesture]] is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

:"There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both [[ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenetic]] levels, has developmental priority over verbal language."{{sfn|Middleton|1990|loc=172}}{{sfn|Nattiez|1976}}{{sfn|Nattiez|1990}}{{sfn|Nattiez1989}}{{sfn|Stefani|1973}}{{sfn|Stefani|1976}}{{sfn|Baroni|1983}}{{sfn|''Semiotica''|1987|loc=66:1–3}}{{clarify |date=November 2018|reason=The quotation cannot stem from all these references at once!}}

Writers on music semiology include Kofi Agawu (on topical theory,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[Heinrich Schenker]],{{sfn|Dunsby and Stopford|1981|loc=49-53}}{{sfn|Meeùs|2017|loc=81-96}} Robert Hatten (on topic, gesture){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Raymond Monelle]] (on topic, musical meaning){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (on introversive taxonomic analysis and ethnomusicological applications){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Anthony Newcomb]] (on narrativity){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, and [[Eero Tarasti]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} (generally considered the founder of musical semiotics).

[[Roland Barthes]], himself a semiotician and skilled [[amateur]] pianist, wrote about music in ''Image-Music-Text,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''The Responsibilities of Form,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} and ''Eiffel Tower,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

Signs, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of [[Philip Tagg]] (''Ten Little Tunes'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Fernando the Flute'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Music’s Meanings''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}) provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of [[Leonard Meyer]] in ''Style and Music''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.

===Education and careers===
[[File:Pat Carpenter picture.JPG|thumb|[[Columbia University]] music theorist Pat Carpenter in a 2013 photo]]
Music theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT&gt;{{cite web|last=McCreless|first=Patrick|title=Society for Music Theory|work=[[Grove Music Online]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT/&gt; This led to the founding of the [[Society for Music Theory]] in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French ''[http://www.sfam.org Société d'Analyse musicale]'' was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the ''[http://www.sbam.be/index.html Société belge d'Analyse musicale]'' in Belgium and the ''[http://www.gatm.it Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale]'' in Italy the same year, the ''[http://www.sma.ac.uk Society for Music Analysis]'' in the UK in 1991, the ''[http://verenigingvoormuziektheorie.net Vereniging voor Muziektheorie]'' in the Netherlands in 1999 and the ''[http://www.gmth.de/home.aspx Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie]'' in Germany in 2000.{{sfn|Meeùs|2015|loc=111}} They were later followed by the [http://eng.otmroo.ru Russian Society for Music Theory] in 2013 and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180328133232/http://ptam.org.pl/ Polish Society for Music Analysis] in 2015, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers.

As part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).

Most music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive.{{Vague|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--How competitive is "very"? As competitive as for, say, a position as an airline pilot?--&gt; Applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired—called an "ABD", for "[[All But Dissertation]]" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a [[graduate school]], supervising M.A. and Ph.D students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5951">'''Neuroarthistory''' is a term coined by Professor [[John Onians]], an [[art history|art historian]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 2005. Neuroarthistory is an approach that concerns the [[neurological]] study of artists, both living and dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2004 Onians taught the [[Postgraduate]] module "Art and the Brain" named after the 1999 paper by Professor [[Semir Zeki]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2005, he began working with Zeki, who is a professor of [[Neurobiology]] at [[University College London]] (and founder of Neuroesthetics) to study what goes on in the brains of artists. They used [[neuroimaging]] and studied the [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes of artists such as the [[painting|painters]] of the [[paleolithic]] [[Chauvet Cave]] art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2005 Onians founded Neuroarthistory in a lecture at the Neuroaesthetics Conference Goldsmiths May 2005. &lt;ref&gt; Onians J (2005) Neuroarthistory: First Principles (A paper presented at the Neuroaesthetics Conference Goldsmith Conference May 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, he wrote and presented the paper 'Neuroarthistory: making more sense of art' which, according to [[The Art Book]] "explored the ways in which our ever-expanding knowledge of the brain invites art historians to reconsider the interaction between the senses and cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In September 2006, Onians presented the results of the research to the [[BA Festival of Science]] in a lecture called 'Cracking the real Da Vinci Code: what happens in the artist’s brain?'.&lt;ref name="UEArelease"&gt;{{cite press release

  | url = http://comm.uea.ac.uk/press/release.asp?id=674
  | accessdate = 2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the study was to learn more about how artists think, and how these thought processes differ between artists of different eras and locations, as well as the differences between professional and amateur artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | format = HTML
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Onians has said that neuroarthistory can be used "both to better understand the nature of familiar artistic phenomena such as style, and to crack so far intractable problems such as ‘what is the origin of art?’"&lt;ref name="UEArelease"/&gt; According to a press release, neuroarthistory can explain why "Florentine painters made more use of line and Venetian painters more of colour. The reason is that '[[Synaptic plasticity|neural plasticity]]' ensured that passive exposure to different natural and man-made environments caused the formation of different visual preferences."&lt;ref name="UEArelease"/&gt;

A book, ''Neuroarthistory: From Aristotle and Pliny to Baxandall and Zeki'' was published in 2008 by Yale University Press, discussing a number of [[case study|case studies]] from art history, and being the 'preface' to a further two books on the subject. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution''' is a term used to describe pollution resulting from many diffuse sources, in direct contrast to [[point source pollution]] which results from a single source. Nonpoint source pollution generally results from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage, or hydrological modification (rainfall and snowmelt) where tracing pollution back to a single source is difficult.&lt;ref name="epa-nps-overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/what-nonpoint-source |title=What is Nonpoint Source? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-02 |website=Polluted Runoff |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-point source water pollution affects a water body from sources such as polluted [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[agricultural]] areas draining into a river, or wind-borne [[debris]] blowing out to sea. Non-point source air pollution affects air quality from sources such as [[smokestack]]s or car [[tailpipe]]s. Although these pollutants have originated from a point source, the long-range transport ability and multiple sources of the pollutant make it a non-point source of pollution. Non-point source pollution can be contrasted with [[point source (pollution)|point source pollution]], where discharges occur to a body of water or into the atmosphere at a single location.

NPS may derive from many different sources with no specific solution may change to rectify the problem, making it difficult to regulate. Non point source water pollution is difficult to control because it comes from the everyday activities of many different people, such as lawn [[fertilizer|fertilization]], applying [[pesticide]]s, [[road construction]] or [[building construction]].&lt;ref name="tceq-nps"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tceq.texas.gov/waterquality/nonpoint-source/mgmt-plan/index.html |title=Management Program for Nonpoint Source Water Pollution |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-22 |publisher=Texas Commission on Environmental Quality |location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the leading cause of water pollution in the United States today, with polluted runoff from agriculture and [[hydromodification]] the primary sources.&lt;ref name="EPA-2004-wq-report"&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=National Water Quality Inventory: Report to Congress; 2004 Reporting Cycle |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-08-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} &lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2003 |title=National Management Measures to Control Non-point Source Pollution from Agriculture |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/national-management-measures-control-nonpoint-source-pollution-agriculture |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-03-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant sources of runoff include [[habitat destruction|habitat modification]] and [[silviculture]] (forestry).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=July 2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/hydromodification-and-habitat-alteration-national-management-measures |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-07-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=May 2005 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Forestry |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/national-management-measures-control-nonpoint-source-pollution-forestry |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-05-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contaminated stormwater washed off parking lots, roads and highways, and lawns (often containing [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s) is called [[urban runoff]]. This runoff is often classified as a type of NPS pollution. Some people may also consider it a point source because many times it is channeled into municipal storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to nearby [[surface water]]s. However, not all urban runoff flows through [[storm drain]] systems before entering water bodies. Some may flow directly into water bodies, especially in developing and suburban areas. Also, unlike other types of point sources, such as industrial discharges, [[sewage treatment]] plants and other operations, pollution in urban runoff cannot be attributed to one activity or even group of activities. Therefore, because it is not caused by an easily identified and regulated activity, urban runoff pollution sources are also often treated as true non-point sources as municipalities work to abate them.

==Principal types==
[[Image:Runoff of soil &amp; fertilizer.jpg|thumb|[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] of [[soil]] and [[fertilizer]] during a rain storm]]

===Sediment===
[[Sediment]] (loose [[soil]]) includes [[silt]] (fine particles) and [[suspended solids]] (larger particles). Sediment may enter surface waters from eroding stream banks, and from [[surface runoff]] due to improper plant cover on urban and rural land.&lt;ref name="IAfact"&gt;Iowa State University. University Extension. Ames, IA. [http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/EDC232A.pdf "Iowa Fact Sheet: Agriculture and Water Quality."] October 2001. Document No. EDC232a.&lt;/ref&gt; Sediment creates [[turbidity]] (cloudiness) in water bodies, reducing the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |last1=Stevenson |first1=J. Court |last2=Piper |first2=Catherine B. |last3=Confer |first3=Nedra |date=1979 |title=Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay |url=https://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |location=Annapolis, MD |access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; High turbidity levels also inhibit drinking [[water purification]] systems.

Sediment can also be discharged from multiple different sources.  Sources include [[construction]] sites (although these are point sources, which can be managed with [[erosion control]]s and [[sediment control]]s), agricultural fields, stream banks, and highly disturbed areas.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"&gt;Penn State University. Pennsylvania Lake Erie NEMO. [http://seagrant.psu.edu/publications/fs/Nonpoint_Source_Pollution.pdf "Nonpoint Source Pollution."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727035540/http://seagrant.psu.edu/publications/fs/Nonpoint_Source_Pollution.pdf |date=2011-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrients===
[[File:Nonpoint Source Pollution.svg|thumb|Nonpoint source pollution is caused when precipitation (1) carries pollutants from the ground such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants which come from fertilizers used on farm lands (2) or urban areas (3). These nutrients can cause [[eutrophication]] (4).]]
Nutrients mainly refers to inorganic matter from runoff, [[landfill]]s, [[livestock]] operations and crop lands. The two primary nutrients of concern are phosphorus and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;Rob Leeds, Larry C. Brown, Nathan L. Watermeier. [https://web.archive.org/web/20020223144636/http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0465.html "Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering."] Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phosphorus]] is a nutrient that occurs in many forms that are [[bioavailable]]. It is notoriously over-abundant in human sewage [[sludge]]. It is a main ingredient in many fertilizers used for agriculture as well as on residential and commercial properties, and may become a [[limiting nutrient]] in freshwater systems and some [[estuaries]]. Phosphorus is most often transported to water bodies via [[soil erosion]] because many forms of phosphorus tend to be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on to soil particles. Excess amounts of phosphorus in aquatic systems (particularly freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and ponds) leads to proliferation of microscopic algae called [[phytoplankton]]. The increase of organic matter supply due to the excessive growth of the phytoplankton is called [[eutrophication]]. A common symptom of eutrophication is [[algae]] blooms that can produce unsightly surface scums, shade out beneficial types of plants, produce taste-and-odor-causing compounds, and poison the water due to toxins produced by the algae. These toxins are a particular problem in systems used for drinking water because some toxins can cause human illness and removal of the toxins is difficult and expensive. Bacterial decomposition of algal blooms consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, generating [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] with detrimental consequences for fish and aquatic invertebrates.

[[Nitrogen]] is the other key ingredient in fertilizers, and it generally becomes a pollutant in saltwater or brackish estuarine systems where nitrogen is a limiting nutrient. Similar to phosphorus in fresh-waters, excess amounts of bioavailable nitrogen in marine systems lead to eutrophication and algae blooms. Hypoxia is an increasingly common result of eutrophication in marine systems and can impact large areas of estuaries, bays, and near shore coastal waters. Each summer, hypoxic conditions form in [[bottom water]]s where the [[Mississippi River]] enters the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. During recent summers, the aereal extent of this "dead zone" is comparable to the area of [[New Jersey]] and has major detrimental consequences for fisheries in the region.

Nitrogen is most often transported by water as [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The nitrogen is usually added to a watershed as organic-N or [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), so nitrogen stays attached to the soil until [[oxidation]] converts it into nitrate. Since the nitrate is generally already incorporated into the soil, the water traveling through the soil (i.e., [[interflow]] and [[tile drainage]]) is the most likely to transport it, rather than surface runoff.

===Toxic contaminants and chemicals===
Compounds including heavy metals like [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]], and [[cadmium]], organics like [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), fire retardants, and other substances are resistant to breakdown.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; These contaminants can come from a variety of sources including human sewage sludge, [[mining]] operations, vehicle emissions, [[fossil fuel]] combustion, urban runoff, industrial operations and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

Toxic chemicals mainly include [[organic compounds]] and [[inorganic compounds]]. These compounds include pesticides like [[DDT]], acids, and salts that have severe effects to the ecosystem and water-bodies. These compounds can threaten the health of both humans and aquatic species while being resistant to environmental breakdown, thus allowing them to persist in the environment.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; These toxic chemicals could come from croplands, nurseries, orchards, building sites, gardens, lawns and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

Acids and salts mainly are inorganic pollutants from irrigated lands, mining operations, urban runoff, industrial sites and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

===Pathogens===
[[Pathogens]] are bacteria and viruses that can be found in water and cause diseases in humans.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; Typically, pathogens cause disease when they are present in public drinking water supplies. Pathogens found in contaminated runoff may include:
* ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]''
* ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''
* ''[[Salmonella]]''
* ''[[Novovirus|Norovirus]]'' and other [[virus]]es
* [[Parasitic worm]]s (helminths).
[[Coliform bacteria]] and [[fecal matter]] may also be detected in runoff.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt;  These [[bacteria]] are a commonly used [[indicator bacteria|indicator]] of water pollution, but not an actual cause of disease.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey. Reston, VA. [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-027-01/ "A Primer on Water Quality."] FS-027-01. March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogens may contaminate runoff due to poorly managed livestock operations, faulty [[septic system]]s, improper handling of pet waste, the over application of human sewage [[sludge]], contaminated storm sewers, and [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s.&lt;ref name="IAfact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt;

==Principal sources==

===Urban and suburban areas===
[[Urban Area|Urban]] and [[Suburban|suburban areas]] are a main sources of nonpoint source pollution due to the amount of runoff that is produced due to the large amount of paved surfaces. Paved surfaces, such as [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]] are impervious to water penetrating them. Any water that is on contact with these surfaces will run off and be absorbed by the surrounding environment. These surfaces make it easier for stormwater to carry pollutants into the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Washington D.C. [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_pollution/lessons/pollution_tutorial.pdf "Nonpoint Source Pollution"] September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction sites tend to have disturbed soil that is easily eroded by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] like [[rain]], [[snow]], and [[hail]]. Additionally, discarded debris on the site can be carried away by runoff waters and enter the aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Typically, in suburban areas, chemicals are used for lawn care. These chemicals can end up in runoff and enter the surrounding environment via storm drains in the city. Since the water in storm drains is not treated before flowing into surrounding water bodies, the chemicals enter the water directly.

===Agricultural operations===
Agricultural operations account for a large percentage of all nonpoint source pollution in the United States. When large tracts of land are [[plow]]ed to grow [[crops]], it exposes and loosens soil that was once buried. This makes the exposed soil more vulnerable to [[erosion]] during [[rainstorm]]s. It also can increase the amount of fertilizer and pesticides carried into nearby bodies of water.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Atmospheric inputs===
{{Cite check|section|date=July 2016}}
Atmospheric inputs of pollution into the air can come from multiple sources. Typically, industrial facilities, like [[factory|factories]], emit air pollution via a [[smokestack]]. Although this is a point source, due to the distributional nature, long-range transport, and multiple sources of the pollution, it is considered a nonpoint source. Additionally, atmospheric pollution can become water pollution, by being washed out of the atmosphere in the form of rain or snow.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}

===Highway runoff===
Highway runoff accounts for a small but widespread percentage of all nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, M.K., Agnew, R.W., Gruber, D., and Kreutzberger, W.A., 1981, Constituents of highway runoff, in v. IV, Characteristics of runoff from operating highways—Research report: [https://archive.org/details/constituentsofhi00gupt_1 "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA/RD–81/045"], 171 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Driscoll, E.D., Shelley, P.E., and Strecker, E.W., 1990, Pollutant loadings and impacts from highway stormwater runoff, v.

===Forestry and mining operations===
[[Forestry]] and [[environmental impact of mining|mining]] operations can have significant inputs to non-point source pollution.

====Forestry====
Forestry operations reduce the number of trees in a given area, thus reducing the oxygen levels in that area as well. This action, coupled with the heavy machinery (harvesters, etc.) rolling over the soil increases the risk of [[erosion]].

====Mining====
Active [[mining]] operations are considered point sources, however runoff from abandoned mining operations contribute to nonpoint source pollution. In [[strip mining]] operations, the top of the mountain is removed to expose the desired [[ore]]. If this area is not properly reclaimed once the mining has finished, [[soil erosion]] can occur. Additionally, there can be chemical reactions with the air and newly exposed rock to create acidic runoff. Water that seeps out of abandoned [[underground mining|subsurface mines]] can also be highly acidic. This can seep into the nearest body of water and change the pH in the aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Marinas and boating activities===
Chemicals used for boat maintenance, like [[paint]], [[solvent]]s, and [[oil]]s find their way into water through runoff. Additionally, spilling fuels or leaking fuels directly into the water from boats contribute to nonpoint source pollution. Nutrient and bacteria levels are increased by poorly maintained sanitary waste receptacles on the boat and pump-out stations.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

==Control==
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment|Erosion control}}
[[Image:Contour buffer strips NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Contour [[buffer strip]]s used to retain soil and reduce [[erosion]]]]

===Urban and suburban areas===
To control non-point source pollution, many different approaches can be undertaken in both urban and suburban areas. [[Buffer strip]]s provide a barrier of grass in between impervious paving material like parking lots and roads, and the closest body of water.  This allows the soil to absorb any pollution before it enters the local aquatic system. [[Retention pond]]s can be built in drainage areas to create an aquatic buffer between runoff pollution and the aquatic environment. Runoff and storm water drain into the retention pond allowing for the contaminants to settle out and become trapped in the pond. The use of [[permeable paving|porous pavement]] allows for rain and storm water to drain into the ground beneath the pavement, reducing the amount of runoff that drains directly into the water body. Restoration methods such as [[Constructed wetland|constructing wetlands]] are also used to slow runoff as well as absorb contamination.

Construction sites typically implement simple measures to reduce pollution and runoff. Firstly, sediment or [[silt fence]]s are erected around construction sites to reduce the amount of sediment and large material draining into the nearby water body.  Secondly, laying grass or straw along the border of construction sites also work to reduce nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

In areas served by single-home septic systems, local government regulations can force septic system maintenance to ensure compliance with water quality standards. In [[Washington (state)]], a novel approach was developed through a creation of a "shellfish protection district" when either a commercial or recreational shellfish bed is downgraded because of ongoing nonpoint source pollution. The shellfish protection district is a geographic area designated by a county to protect water quality and tideland resources, and provides a mechanism to generate local funds for water quality services to control nonpoint sources of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psparchives.com/restore-habs/|title=Restore Habitat|author=|date=10 April 2018|website=Marine|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two shellfish protection districts in south [[Puget Sound]] have instituted septic system operation and maintenance requirements with program fees tied directly to property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.thurston.wa.us/health/ehrp/nisqually.html |title=PHSS HomeA-Z TopicsPrograms/Serv |publisher=Co.thurston.wa.us |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural operations===
To control sediment and runoff, farmers may utilize erosion controls to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include [[contour plowing]], crop [[mulch]]ing, [[crop rotation]], planting [[perennial]] crops or installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-95–4-96}}&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Fort Worth, TX.

June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/484.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Mulching."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 484. September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Conservation tillage]]'' is a concept used to reduce runoff while planting a new crop. The farmer leaves some crop reside from the previous planting in the ground to help prevent runoff during the planting process.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Nutrients are typically applied to farmland as commercial fertilizer; animal [[manure]]; or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p. 2–9}} Farmers can develop and implement [[nutrient management]] plans to reduce excess application of nutrients.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-37–4-38}}&lt;ref&gt;NRCS.

August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/595.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Pest Management."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 595. July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/ipm.htm "Integrated Pest Management Principles."] March 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry operations===
With a well-planned placement of both logging trails, also called skid trails, can reduce the amount of sediment generated. By planning the trails location as far away from the logging activity as possible as well as contouring the trails with the land, it can reduce the amount of loose sediment in the runoff. Additionally, by replanting trees on the land after logging, it provides a structure for the soil to regain stability as well as replaces the logged environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Marinas===
Installing shut off valves on fuel pumps at a marina dock can help reduce the amount of spillover into the water. Additionally, pump-out stations that are easily accessible to boaters in a marina can provide a clean place in which to dispose of sanitary waste without dumping it directly into the water. Finally, something as simple as having trash containers around a marina can prevent larger objects entering the water.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

'''Pickup artists''' ('''PUA''') – also known as '''pick-up artists''', '''seduction community''', or '''pickup community''' – is a movement of men whose goal is [[seduction]] and [[sexual selection|sexual success]] with and access to women. Members of the community are often referred to as pickup artists (PUA). The community exists through Internet [[newsletter]]s and [[weblog]]s, marketing (e.g. [[banner ad]]s, seminars, one-on-one coaching), forums and groups, as well as over a hundred local clubs, known as "lairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/winging-it/2007/01/28/1169919210771.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Winging it |author= |date=29 January 2007 |work=The Age  |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The modern seduction movement dates to 1970, with the publication of ''How To Pick Up Girls!'' by [[Eric Weber (director)|Eric Weber]], credited as the first modern pickup artist.{{sfn|Strauss|2005|page=430}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Weber | first=Eric | title=How to Pick Up Girls!: Discover Exactly how to Meet Beautiful Women.

The seduction community itself originated with [[Ross Jeffries]] and his students. In the late 1980s, Jeffries taught workshops, promoted a collection of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP) techniques called "speed seduction" (SS), and published a short book of his techniques, ''How to Get the Women You Desire into Bed''.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots"&gt;{{cite news|title=He Aims!

In 1994, Lewis De Payne, then a student of Jeffries, founded the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.* hierarchy|alt]].seduction.fast (ASF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastseduction.com/asf-faq.shtml|title=alt.seduction.fast FAQ and history|author=Jay Valens|date=3 March 2002|accessdate=16 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524223047/http://www.fastseduction.com/asf-faq.shtml|archivedate=24 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which marked the birth of the community per se.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots" /&gt; This then spawned a network of other Internet discussion forums, email lists, blogs, and sites where seduction techniques could be exchanged.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.08.06/nlp-0606.html |title=Working Overtime on the Seduction Line |author=Bill Forman |date=8 February 2006 |work=Metroactive |publisher=Metro Publishing Inc |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original alt.seduction.fast became overwhelmed with [[spam (electronic)|spam]], and a group called "Learn the Skills Corporation" developed a moderated alternative known as "Moderated ASF" (commonly "mASF").{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} During the same period, in the late 1990s, Clifford Lee began his ''Cliff's List Seduction Letter'' as a central independent voice of the community.&lt;ref name="Toronto Sun"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2008/12/31/7891486.html |title=Disgraced doctor is T.O's seduction guru |author=Jenny Yuen |date=13 April 2008 |work=Toronto Sun |publisher=Sun Media |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other seduction teachers emerged with competing methods, and became known within this community as "seduction gurus" or "gurus".&lt;ref name="Sex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/071405/news2.html |title=Seduction for Dummies |author=Kristian Gravenor |date=14 July 2005 |work=Montreal Mirror |publisher=Communications Gratte-Ciel Ltée |accessdate=26 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716235052/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/071405/news2.html |archivedate=16 July 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful seduction/pick up book was a manual by [[Tariq Nasheed]] (also known as King Flex) entitled ''The Art Of Mackin'', which was released in 2000. Tariq Nasheed went on to write several other seduction/dating books such as ''The Mack Within: The Holy Book Of Game''  and ''The Elite Way:10 Rules Men Must Know In Order To Deal With Women''.

The community was brought to greater mainstream awareness with the 1999 drama film ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', in which [[Tom Cruise]] portrayed a charismatic yet embittered and emotionally troubled pickup guru who was loosely modeled on Ross Jeffries.&lt;ref&gt;Konow, David (January/February 2000). "PTA Meeting: An Interview with Paul Thomas Anderson". ''Creative Screenwriting''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, journalist [[Neil Strauss]] wrote ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists]]'', an exposé of the seduction community. ''The Game'' reached the [[New York Times Bestseller List]], and made known pickup and seduction techniques to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2008-04-09/news/cock-and-awe-st-louis-pickup-artists-rule-the-roost/3 |title=Cock and Awe |author=Aimee Levitt |date=9 April 2008 |work=Riverfront Times |publisher= |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community was further publicized with the television show ''[[The Pick-up Artist (TV series)|The Pick Up Artist]]'' (2007–2008) on [[VH1]].

Within the community, ''seduction lairs'' are underground meeting groups for men devoted to the study of [[seduction]] as it is taught in the seduction community. Lairs first began as study groups soon after Ross Jeffries released his first products and began teaching sometime in the early 90s.&lt;ref name="eyeweekly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/features/article/22843 |title=Portrait of a Pickup Artist |author=Alex Molotkow |date=2 April 2008 |work=Eye Weekly |publisher=Star Media Group |accessdate=26 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207223645/http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/features/article/22843 |archivedate=7 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of lairs now exist worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallaspua.com/lairs.htm |title=Lair List |author= |date= |work=Lair List |publisher=Dallas PUA Society |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "lair" typically involves two elements: an online forum and group meetings. These elements are used as resources for men who want to learn to become well-versed in how to successfully attract women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5jofAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=adAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5923,3535197&amp;dq=seduction-community+lairs&amp;hl=en |title=From Chump to Pickup Artist via 'The Community' |author=Neil Strauss |date=25 January 2004 |work= |publisher=Herald-Journal |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==
Supporters of this community typically believe that the conventional dating advice for men is flawed. For example, they reject the notion that men should attempt to woo women by spending money on them (e.g. buying drinks, presents, jewelry), calling it ''[[supplication]]''.

Many members of the seduction community work on their "game" (seduction skills) by improving their understanding of psychology, their confidence and self-esteem (termed "inner game"), and their social skills and physical appearance (physical fitness, fashion sense, grooming) ("outer game"). Many members of the community believe that one's "game" is refined through regular practice,&lt;ref name="macleans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20050829_111329_111329 |title=Q&amp;A with Author Neil Strauss |author=George Lianne |date=29 August 2005 |work=Maclean's |publisher=Kenneth Whyte |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619125551/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20050829_111329_111329 |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the idea that the abilities needed to interact in this way with women can be improved.

The seduction community has a unique set of [[acronym]]s and [[jargon]] for describing male–female dynamics and social interaction.&lt;ref name="Sex" /&gt;  For example, "average frustrated chump" (AFC) is a term coined by Ross Jeffries to describe males who are typically clueless and incompetent with women.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots" /&gt; "Alpha-Male Of the Group" (AMOG) is a reference to a competing male, who is usually either befriended by the PUA, or, if necessary, ridiculed.

The community claims that these concepts derive from scientific disciplines, such as the concept of [[social proof]] from the psychology of [[Social influence|influence]], and various concepts from [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] (such as the term "[[Alpha (biology)|alpha male]]").

== Pickup artist==
A pickup artist (commonly abbreviated PUA) is a person who practices finding, attracting, and [[seduction|seducing]] sexual partners. Such a person purportedly abides by a certain system deemed effective by that community in their attempts to seduce partners.

The use of ''pickup'' in this context, [[slang]] for making a casual acquaintance with a stranger in anticipation of sexual relations, was popularized by the 1970 book ''How to Pick Up Girls'' by Eric Weber,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | edition = 1st | title = How to Pick Up Girls | first = Eric | last = Weber | publisher = Symphony Press | place = Tenafly, NJ, USA | year = 1970}},&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''Pick-Up Times'', a short-lived 1970s magazine, and the 1987 semi-autobiographical romantic comedy ''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pick-up Artist]]'', written and directed by [[James Toback]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss (2005), pp. 124, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works of pickup artist culture include [[Neil Strauss]]'s book, ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists]]'', and the 2007 [[VH1]] [[reality television]] series, ''[[The Pickup Artist (TV series)|The Pickup Artist]]'', starring the pickup artist [[Erik von Markovik|Mystery]]. The pickup artist [[Roosh V]] has self-published 14 books describing techniques for seducing women.&lt;ref name="citypaper"&gt;Jule Banville, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/08/12/blogger-stud-living-in-dads-basement-writing-second-book-on-how-to-get-laid/ "Blogger Stud Living in Dad’s Basement, Writing Second Book on How to Get Laid"], "Washington City Paper", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', such books are the "cash cow" of the pickup industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lu |first=Peter |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/09/20/greatest_pickup_artists_of_their_generation/ |title=Simple Pickup: Are these the greatest pickup artists of all time? |publisher=Salon.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term pickup artist is also associated with the seduction community, a [[heterosexual]] male [[subculture]] which strives to improve sexual and romantic abilities with women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-game-and-real-social-dynamics-is-the-seduction-community-pushing-the-idea-that-no-just-means-not-8463333.html|title=The Game and Real Social dynamics: Is the seduction community pushing the idea that ‘no’ just means ‘not yet’?|last=Bloodworth|first=James|date=2013-01-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Routines and gambits are developed to stimulate purported "attraction switches", often combined with techniques derived from an alleged form of hypnosis called [[neuro-linguistic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/relationships/6987982/Pick-up-artists-online-seduction-and-dating-tips.html |title=Pick-up artists, online seduction and dating tips |author=Tom Chivers |date=14 January 2010 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location = UK | accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members aim to improve their seductive capabilities through the development of various lifestyles. The culture surrounding pickup has spawned an entire industry servicing those who want to improve their social and seduction skills with consultations and in-field training.&lt;ref&gt;Mountford, J. B. "Topic Modeling The Red Pill." Social Sciences 7.3 (2018): 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickup artists receive mixed to negative responses from the press and general public, with many regarding both the practice and theory as immoral, sexist and ineffective. In 2014, following widely supported public petitions, U.S.-based PUA speaker and instructor [[Julien Blanc]] was denied entry to both the United Kingdom and Australia after he published YouTube videos explaining and demonstrating behaviors such as grabbing women by the throat, and forcing their heads towards his crotch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Gail|title='Dating coach' Julien Blanc kicked out of Australia for crude 'pick-up' schtick|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/10/dating-coach-julien-blanc-kicked-out-of-australia-for-his-controversial-tactics/|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=Washington Post|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julien Blanc: UK denies visa to 'pick-up artist'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30119100|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=BBC News|date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Megan|title=Is This the Most Hated Man in the World?|url=http://time.com/3578387/julien-blanc-feminism-real-social-dynamics/|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=Time|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickup artists have also been parodied, as in the March 2011 ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]''. [[BBC Radio 1]] debated [[Neil Strauss]]' ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'' on many shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = The BBC | title = Radio 1 | location = UK |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gq42l}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickup is often divided into different styles, referred to as "outer game", "inner game", "direct game", and "indirect game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist|title=My Life as a Pickup Artist|date=28 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140127012818/http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist|archivedate=27 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Petra Boynton has stated that there is "no evidence of effectiveness" for any claims of pickup artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/6987982/Pick-up-artists-online-seduction-and-dating-tips.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Tom | last=Chivers | title=Pick-up artists, online seduction and dating tips | date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by Nathan Oesch of the [[University of Oxford]] Department of Experimental Psychology, however, confirmed attraction and seduction principles, as described in Strauss' books on the subject, do have a factual basis in social, physiological and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name="epjournal.net"&gt;Oesch, Nathan, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130404041916/http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/EP10899909.pdf The Dating Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Emerging Science of Human Courtship]", ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]'', 2012. 10(5): 899-909&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite primarily being a male movement, there are also female pick-up artists who use similar techniques to seduce men.&lt;ref name="femaleartist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/it-happened-to-me-i-was-a-female-pick-up-artist|title=It Happened To Me: I'm A Female Pick-Up Artist Who Studied Under Neil Strauss and Mystery|date=November 21, 2012|author=Leigh, Arden|work=xoJane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==

There are a variety of PUA "schools of thought" which promote numerous different methods. These range from approaches that are very indirect, and which stress starting with casual conversation before building into a flirt, to methods in which attraction is communicated very openly and directly. Most PUAs acknowledge the distinction between so-called "inner game" and "outer game", where the former relates to techniques directed towards increasing one's self-confidence and mindset, whilst the latter are about actual interaction with real people. Inner game may involve taking greater care in one's looks and presentation, identifying and neutralising self-defeating mental habits (also known as "limiting beliefs"), and developing mental routines to build confidence. Outer game involves actual interaction with individuals and groups of people, from body language to conversation. The pick-up artist may frequent a self-help group and converse with MRA's (men's rights activists), incels (involuntary celibates), and other PUA's to discuss seduction tips.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.avclub.com/the-matrix-couldn-t-dream-up-the-internet-of-2018-1822353087&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', [[Neil Strauss]] documents various practices that occur in the seduction community.  Members of the community believe in achieving success with women through putatively scientific and [[Empiricism|empirical]] means, rather than by relying on good looks or intuitive instinct, or by following societal courtship conventions. The practice of going out with the purpose of meeting women is known as "sarging", a term coined by [[Ross Jeffries]], after his cat "Sarge". A pickup artist can "sarge" alone, or with a [[Wingman (social)|wingman]].&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/07/pickup-artists-the-girliest-of-men/59578/ |title=Pickup Artists: The Girliest of Men |author=Megan McArdle |date=12 July 2010|work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffries employed [[Neuro-linguistic_programming]] techniques for the purposes of seduction, although Strauss claims in ''The Game'' that NLP was quickly rendered obsolete by the rise of techniques based on social dynamics, particularly [[Erik von Markovik]]'s "Mystery Method". The Mystery Method describes seduction as a linear process involving three stages (establishing attraction, building comfort, and seduction) each of which involves a variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Erik von Markovik, "The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed", St Martin's Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Negging]]", one of von Markovik's most famous and controversial techniques, has been described as the practice of giving a woman a backhanded compliment such as "nice nails – are they real?", to weaken her confidence and therefore render her more vulnerable to seduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/cockblocked-by-redistribution|title = Cockblocked by Redistribution: A Pick-up Artist in Denmark|last = Baker|first = Katie J.M.|date = Fall 2013|work = Dissent Magazine|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that depriving a woman of obsequious validation and attention will influence her to seek it from the man who negs her.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap, S. G. "[http://thepointmag.com/2010/examined-life/love-in-the-age-of-the-pickup-artist Love in the Age of the Pickup Artist]", ''The Point'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss refers to negs as "disqualifiers" in his book [[Rules of the Game]], emphasizing that the primary purpose of using a neg is not to put a woman down, but for a man to disqualify himself as a potential suitor, thereby allowing for interaction to start on less loaded terms. [[Conor Friedersdorf]] lambasted the use of negging by pick-up artists, but admitted that, based on his observations, negging did appear to be effective at generating attraction from some women.&lt;ref name="Some I Insult, Some I Let Go"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/07/dating-and-deception/198480/ Dating and Deception]", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/07/-the-neg-contd/198419/ "The Neg" Cont'd]", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 24 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[http://theamericanscene.com/2009/08/08/stop-negging-them-on#comment Stop Negging Them On!]", ''The American Scene'', 8 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pawning" is trading or discarding an unwanted woman as proof of the PUA's own social value, and "going caveman" is escalating physical contact while reducing verbal contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/world/elliot-rodger-and-the-creepy-world-of-the-pickup-artist-20140528-zrqg1.html|title = Elliot Rodger and the creepy world of the pick-up artist|last = Koziol|first = Michael|date = 28 May 2014|work = Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One constellation of PUA techniques, called "Last Minute Resistance" tactics (LMR tactics), is designed to convince a woman to have sex after she has indicated that she doesn't want to. This includes tactics from those which are mutually beneficial – such as being okay with the woman being on her period – to "callous manipulation" and rape.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201206/interview-pickup-artist-chaser-clarisse-thorn|title = Interview with Pickup Artist Chaser Clarisse Thorn|last = Kaufman|first = Scott Barry|date = 1 June 2012|work = Psychology Today|accessdate = 9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaching and opening ===
Pickup artists generally assume the mindset that men should lead and initiate contacts and plans in general in order to be more attractive, and that women will not generally initiate contact although they want men to, requiring men to begin any interaction by ''approaching'' them, but many have also cultivated a sensitivity to direct and indirect signals of [[Proteans|possible sexual interest]].

Members of the seduction community often practice approaching and opening repetitively; some have done thousands of approaches. Strauss describes a pickup artist who did 125 approaches in one day.&lt;ref name=TheGame298&gt;Strauss, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Mystery Method"&lt;ref&gt;Erik von Markovik, "The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed", St Martin's Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; encourages approaching groups of strangers, starting indirect conversations, and giving attention to all members of the group without initiating conversation with the "target" until attraction has been established.

Feminist [[BDSM]] writer and activist Clarisse Thorn, author of ''Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser|Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser: Long Interviews with Hideous Men'', criticizes the PUA community as frequently "absurd and sexist", "pushy and problematic" and encouraging adversarial gender roles. However, she also argues that PUA tactics are worth understanding because they are not unique to the PUA community, but instead represent society-wide beliefs and patterns and strategies of human sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other dating coaches, such as Sebastian Harris, publicly speak against the misogynistic tendencies of the seduction community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalseducer.com/dear-woman-hater/|title=Dear Woman Hater|last=Harris|first=Sebastian|date=1 May 2016|website=Global Seducer|publisher=Sebastian Harris|access-date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UCLA Center for the Study of Women]] argues that PUA culture is misogynist, and exists on a continuum of sexist behaviours and attitudes that includes rape and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5tw6h8nk|title = From Misogyny to Murder: Everyday Sexism and Femicide in Cross-Cultural Context|last = Rodríguez|first = Gilda|date = December 2010|journal = CSW Update|accessdate = 9 June 2014|doi = |publisher = UCLA Center for the Study of Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional [[dating coach]], radio personality and [[self help]] book author [[Alan Roger Currie (American author)|Alan Roger Currie]] has frequently criticized the seduction community and many of the misleading and manipulative tactics espoused by many of the more popular pickup artists.  Currie is specifically critical of men giving women the misleading impression that they are interested in engaging in a long-term, emotionally profound, monogamous romantic relationship when those men know in reality that they are really seeking to engage in some form of short-term, non-monogamous, [[casual sex]] with these same women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/modeone/2012/07/13/pros-cons-of-approaching-women-directly-vs-indirectly | title=The Pros and Cons of approaching women using 'direct game' vs. 'indirect game'| website=[[BlogTalkRadio]] | publisher=Mode One Multimedia, Inc. | host=Upfront &amp; Straightforward | date=12 July 2012 | time=| access-date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage==
The seduction community has received increased media attention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/lifestyle/cl-et-game31aug31,0,1782296.story |title=Danger: pickup artists ahead |author=Deborah Netburn |date=31 August 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="operation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-1766167,00.html |title=Operation pick-up |author=Hugo Rifkind |date=3 September 2005 |work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dark arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=1923372005 |title=Revealed: the dark arts of the ladykiller |author=Liese Spencer |date=12 September 2005 |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014155702/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=1923372005 |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ganahl"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ganahl |first=Jane |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/09/25/LVGPHEQA941.DTL |title=Ahead of the game |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=25 November 2005 |accessdate=22 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the publication of [[Neil Strauss]]' article on the community in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots"/&gt; and his memoir ''The Game''. Response to the seduction community has been varied; it has been called [[misogyny|misogynistic]], and a review of ''The Game'' in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' characterized the community as "a puerile cult of sexual conquest", and calls its tactics "sinister" and "pathetic".&lt;ref name="Ganahl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,1577189,00.html |title=Girls, if you see this man, run a mile |author=Rafael Behr |date=25 September 2005 |work=The Observer |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the review, "if women in the book are sometimes treated as a commodity, they come out looking better than the men, who can be downright loathsome—and show themselves eventually to be pretty sad, dysfunctional characters".

[[Feminists]] tend to be critical of the seduction community. [[Beatrix Campbell]] has stated that ''The Game'' "sexually objectifies women", arguing that "Nowhere from its description do you get a sense of men being helped to be human in an easy and agreeable way...it's not about having any rapport or relationship... the only thing that will help them in relationships is [[empathy]] and liking women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Andrew |url=http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/news/article308631.ece |title=Passing on 'foolproof' pick-up tips.

According to an article in ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', some feminists believe that pickup "isn't just cheesy; it's offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Dave |url=http://eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.13.05/arts/artsweek.html |title=Get laid, get fucked |work=[[Eye Weekly]] |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626123314/http://eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.13.05/arts/artsweek.html |archivedate=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article cites a proposal put forward by a feministblogs.org writer as an alternative to the formula used by expert PUAs: "Shake my hand. [Say] 'Hi, my name is ...' Treat me like a human being. Avoid seeing women as conquests and men as competition."

An article in the ''[[Houston Press]]'' claimed that the seduction community "isn't the lechfest it might sound like". The article quotes the webmaster of confidentup.com defending the community: "It's no more [[deception|deceptive]] than [[push-up bra]]s or [[Stiletto heel|heels]] or going to the gym to work out...This isn't just a game of words and seduction, it's an overall life improvement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Malisow |title=Keeping Score |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2005-06-02/news/keeping-score/2 |work=[[Houston Press]] |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss says, "I really think all of these routines and manipulations are just a way for a guy to get his foot in the door so that if a woman connects with him, she can still choose him," and that seduction techniques "can be used for good or evil!"&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dark arts"/&gt; He argues that "women are incredibly intuitive—the creepy guys with bad intentions don't do nearly as well as the guys who love and respect women".&lt;ref name="Ganahl"/&gt;

Several writers describe observing men in the seduction community first-hand. Some women recount experiences with men they believed to be pickup artists who tried to "pick them up", and some men recount trying out pickup techniques. Catherine Townsend, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', describes a negative experience with a man she believed was a pickup artist and used a lot of "negs" on her: "The problem is that some guys clearly don't know when to quit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Townsend |first=Catherine |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article354165.ece |title=Sleeping Around |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205064115/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article354165.ece |archivedate=5 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[San Francisco Magazine]]'' recounts the experience the blogger "Dolly", who is the author of the popular sex blog ''The Truth about Cocks and Dolls'', had with the seduction community. According to the article, Dolly was:

{{quote|[...] put off by PUAs at first. But after she met more, including two from San Francisco, she wrote a letter to the ''Village Voice'' defending them, in response to the paper’s negative article on the subject in March. “PUAs try to create a fun, positive, and exciting experience for the woman,” Dolly wrote. “The credo many follow is ‘Leave her better than you found her.’ What’s so bad about that? That they want to get laid, too? Guess what? Guys have always wanted sex and will continue to want sex. You can’t fault them for finally discovering methods that are successful.|&lt;ref name="Yogis"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yogis |first=Jaimal |url=http://www.sanfranmag.com/archives/view_story/1306/ |title=What does it take to get a date in this town? |work=[[San Francisco Magazine]] |year=2006 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021021508/http://www.sanfranmag.com/archives/view_story/1306/ |archivedate=21 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After spending three days immersed in a Mystery Method Corp (now Love Systems) seminar, [[Gene Weingarten]] expressed his uneasiness about "a step by step tutorial for men in how to pick up women, make them comfortable in your presence, and bed them, ideally within seven hours of your first meeting" and wondered aloud, "Is there something inherently wrong with the notion of seduction as a classroom-taught skill, complete with a long hierarchy of 'lines' that work, seemingly spontaneous topics of conversation that are anything but spontaneous, tricks for seeming 'vulnerable', and tips on how to behave so as to deliver subtle but effective nonverbal inducements to intimacy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/community/groups/index.html?plckForumPage=ForumDiscussion&amp;plckDiscussionId=Cat:a70e3396-6663-4a8d-ba19-e44939d3c44fForum:a8bc6fd8-cf9f-43ca-99a4-05fdb4342697Discussion:86aaac5a-5b7f-4a26-9cb9-03b94121ca42 |title=The Gene Pool: Sex and Deceit |author=Gene Weingarten |date=5 March 2008 |work=The Washington Post |publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an article for the ''Times Online'', [[Hugo Rifkind]] participated in a seminar by Neil Strauss. Rifkind describes initially struggling with seduction techniques, eventually learning to attract women's interest, and then feeling guilty. Rifkind writes, "After a little more practice, my 'game' is improving dramatically. I can open with fluency, and there's an injection of confidence which comes from knowing exactly what you are going to say next." When he attracts a woman's attention, "she is—quite honestly—looking at me like I'm the most fascinating person she's ever met. As a human being and, perhaps more crucially, as somebody with a girlfriend, I feel like absolute scum."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Commercialization ==
The media attention and rapid growth of the seduction community has led to commercialization and competition.  Teachers of seduction tactics sell workshops, books, [[e-books]], [[DVDs]], and CDs over the internet.  In ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', Strauss describes the competition between seduction gurus.  In The Journal, teaching of these seduction methods is shown by way of 50+ examples.

==Academic research==
An academic paper on the community, published in 2012 by Eric C. Hendriks in the journal ''[[International Society for Ethnology and Folklore|Cultural Analysis]]'', details the value system guiding successful members of the seduction community based on an international study including participant observation of bootcamp and "lair" meetings in Germany. The article argues that the values of successful practitioners of the "Venusian arts" are informed by an intertwining of "hedonistic goals and diffused forms of [[Inner-worldly asceticism|innerworldly asceticism]]". According to Hendricks, the hedonistic goal of sexual satisfaction interacts in a complex fashion with a set of "disciplinarian and ascetic values", and the author stresses that these disciplinarian and ascetic values are central to the value system of performant practitioners, even though the marketing of seduction gurus often promises an easy, effortless "quick fix".&lt;ref name="socrates.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~culturalanalysis/volume11/vol11_Hendriks.html|title=Cultural Analysis, Volume 11, 2012: Ascetic Hedonism / Eric C. Hendriks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Nathan Oesch of the [[University of Oxford]] Department of Experimental Psychology confirmed attraction and seduction principles, as described in Strauss' books on the subject, do have a factual basis in social, physiological and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="epjournal.net"/&gt;

Andrew King's cultural history of the pickup artist in the journal ''Sexuality &amp; Culture'' argues that, as a genre, the growth of PUA philosophy parallels the rise of feminism in academic and popular culture—and in some ways can be seen as a critique of its limitations, particularly the idea of gender egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Andrew Stephen |title=Feminism’s Flip Side: A Cultural History of the Pickup Artist |journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture |date=2 November 2017 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=299–315 |doi=10.1007/s12119-017-9468-0 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-017-9468-0 |accessdate=26 June 2018 |language=en |issn=1095-5143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22684">{{short description|The relationship between plants and animals and a polar environment}}
'''Polar ecology''' is the relationship between plants and animals in a polar environment. Polar environments are in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions. Arctic regions are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and it contains land and the islands that surrounds it. [[Antarctica]] is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and it also contains the land mass, surrounding islands and the ocean. [[Polar region]]s also contain the subantarctic and [[subarctic]] zone which separate the polar regions from the [[temperate region]]s. Antarctica and the Arctic lie in the [[polar circle]]s. The polar circles are not visible on the earth but it is shown on maps to be the areas that receives less sunlight due to less radiation. These areas either receive sunlight ([[midnight sun]]) or shade ([[polar night]]) 24 hours a day because of the [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|earth's tilt]]. Plants and animals in the polar regions are able to withstand living in harsh weather conditions but are facing environmental threats that limit their survival.

==Climate==
{{see also|Polar meteorology}}
[[Polar climate]]s are cold, windy and dry. Because of the lack of [[precipitation]] and low temperatures the Arctic and Antarctic are considered the world's largest [[desert]]s or [[Polar desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml The World's Largest Deserts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/types/ Types of Seserts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[radiation]] from the sun that is received is reflected off the snow making the polar regions cold.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 23&lt;/ref&gt; When the radiation is reflected, the heat is also reflected. The polar regions reflect 89-90% of the sun radiation that the earth receives.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 24&lt;/ref&gt; And because Antarctica is closer to the sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]], it receives 7% more radiation than the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/152724/ Factors affecting surface ultraviolet radiation levels in the Arctic]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the polar region, the atmosphere is thin. Because of this the [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]] that gets to the atmosphere can cause fast [[sun tanning]] and [[Photokeratitis|snow blindness]].

Polar regions are dry areas; there is very little precipitation due to the cold air. There are some times when the [[humidity]] may be high but the [[water vapor]] present in the air may be low. Wind is also strong in the polar region. [[Wind]] carries snow creating [[blizzard]] like conditions. Winds may also move small organisms or vegetation if it is present.&lt;ref name="stone44"&gt;Stonehouse, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The wind blows the snow making [[snowdrift]]s or snow dunes which may exist even in the spring when the snow is thawing out.&lt;ref name="stone44"/&gt; It is hard for meteorologists to measure the amount of precipitation. This is because it is expensive to take care of the stations that collect weather data and it hard for them to measure snow fall amounts because the wind blows the snow too much to calculate exact amounts.

The temperatures are similar between the Arctic and Antarctic. The temperatures in the Arctic are different depending on the location. Temperatures in the Arctic have a higher range than in the Antarctic. Temperatures can range as much as {{convert|100|C-change|0}}. Along the coast in the Arctic temperatures average {{Convert|-30|to|-40|C}} in December, January and February.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ice melts along the coast during the summer months which are around June, July and August and the temperature may rise a few degrees above freezing causing there to be some vegetation. During these same months in the northern regions there will be 24 hours of daylight. Arctic regions also receive a lot of snowfall. The [[Arctic Basin]] has snow 320 days out of the year while the Arctic Seas have snow cover 260 days a year.&lt;ref name="mel14"/&gt; The thickness of the snow averages {{Convert|30|–|40|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mel14"&gt;Melnikov, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenland]], temperatures have an average temperature of {{convert|-40|C}} in the winter and in the summer the temperatures reach {{Convert|-12|C}}. Iceland on the other hand is in a subarctic region meaning it is near the temperate zone. Because of this the temperatures are above the freezing point throughout much of the year. In Russia temperatures are extremely cold. In [[Verkhoyansk]], Siberia it has reached the coldest temp of {{Convert|-68.8|C}} in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The temperatures in the summer in Siberia can get to {{Convert|36|C}}.

In the Antarctic there is less temperature variations. Temperatures only range by around {{Convert|30|C-change|0}}. The winter months are May till September while the summer months will be October till April. The sun reappears in September which then starts the 24 hours of daylight. The temperatures are different between the plateaus in Antarctica and between the coasts. The plateaus are the coldest regions of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer months there is low precipitation with light winds. [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] has received the lowest temperature worldwide getting as low as {{Convert|-88.3|C}} in 1960. The West Antarctica plateau reaches snow levels of around {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}. This area is also warmer but it receives the heaviest snow and receives more wind. Because of the cold desert like conditions on the plateaus there are very little plants and animals. Some species of birds though have been seen.

On the coasts in the summer there is more wind, and it is cloudier. Coasts with higher latitudes have a temperature of {{Convert|-24|C}} in the winter months whereas lower latitude coasts get down to {{Convert|-20|C}}. Coastal areas may receive {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} or more of snow.

==Water==
[[Water]] is an important part of human survival. Because of its cold temperature much of the earth's water comes from the polar regions. 90% of the world's water comes from the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic ice cap]] although a lot of this water is not used.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Water environments are important for many species around the world. Many bacteria thrive there as well as algae and flora.

Many of the ponds or lakes in polar regions are frozen over or snow covered for most of the year. Larger lakes thaw out around the edges during the warmer months while the smaller lakes thaw entirely. There are few rivers in the polar regions. The Arctic has more rivers compared to Antarctica. The regions also have ponds. The ponds that attract birds tend to be rich in nutrients. This is because of the bird droppings or bird feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 109&lt;/ref&gt; There are two different types of lakes in polar regions including Arctic lakes and Antarctic lakes. Of the Arctic lakes they include glacial lakes and permafrost lakes.

The polar regions include the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Southern Ocean]]. The Arctic Ocean covers {{Convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 127&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring the ice covers an area of {{Convert|5000000|-|8000000|km2|abbr=on}} and in the winter it is twice that. In this area it is never totally ice-covered. This is due to the winds breaking up the ice. Because of these cracks in the ice there is more biological productivity in the ocean.

The Southern Ocean is {{Convert|28000000|km2|abbr=on}}. This ocean contains the [[Weddell Sea]] and [[Ross Sea]]. The ocean contains large packs of ice that surrounds Antarctica.

==Land==
Because of the cold weather it is hard for plants to grow. Frozen ground covers most of the polar regions for the majority of the year. [[Permafrost]] reaches a thickness of {{Convert|600|-|1000|m|abbr=on}} deep. Large amounts of permafrost can lead to poor water drainage. Due to the permafrost the water in the soil remains frozen for most of the year. In the summer the top of the permafrost may be covered with water due to melting in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Weathering is also common in polar regions. There is rubble from rocks that are scattered on the land due to movement of [[glacier]]s. Also quick temperature change causes weathering.

The main type of soil in the polar regions is ahumic soil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=00v6iF3X4gEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Ahumic+soil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s2_LbB1b0v&amp;sig=MqeXHlk65XcGD5L-3ubQDNEHAGs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kHh1Uo3jHuKbiAK5qoDADg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahumic%20soil&amp;f=false Antarctic Soils and Soil Forming Processes: J. C. F. Tedrow, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the cold desert soil. This soil consists of sand that is frozen. These soils tend to not have a lot of vegetation but [[bacteria]] has been found.

The other type of soil is organic soil. This type of soil is found in areas that are warmer and have more moisture. Some vegetation that lives here are [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[moss]]es. One type of organic soil is the brown soils, which have drainage.

== Animals ==
Due to the harsh weather in the polar regions, there are not many animals. The animals that do exist in the polar region are similar between the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The animals do differ by the temperature. In the Arctic some invertebrates include spiders, mites, mosquitoes and flies. In warmer areas of the polar regions moths, butterflies and beetles can be found. Some of the larger animals that exist are foxes, wolves, rabbits, hares, polar bears, [[Reindeer|reindeer/caribou]]. There are various bird species that have been spotted in the Arctic. Eight species of birds reside on the polar [[tundra]] year round while 150 breed in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The birds that do breed go to the Arctic between May and July. One of the known birds is the [[snowy owl]], which has enough fat on it to be able to survive in the cold temperatures.

In the Antarctic some invertebrates that exist are mites, fleas and ticks. Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a land mammal population.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 105&lt;/ref&gt; There are also no birds that reside in Antarctica. Though, it has been known that various birds from South America have been spotted in Antarctica.

For animals to be able to live in the polar region they have to have adaptations which allow them to live in the cold and windy environments. These animals have originated with these adaptations, and animals that live in these regions are accumulating adaptations to be able to live in this type of environment. Some of these adaptations may be to be big and insolated, have a lot of fur, and to be darker. Also, many animals live in groups to be able to protect themselves from the cold. Animals also tend to be [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] which are animals that maintain a high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;177{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller invertebrates also tend to be smaller in polar regions which helps them conserve energy.

There are also many different animals that live in the sea water near polar regions. [[Squid]]s are one animal that live in both Antarctica and the Arctic. They are the food source for other large animals such as the male [[sperm whale]].&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 202&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a wide variety of fish in the polar regions. [[Arctogadus glacialis|Arctic cod]] is a major species in the Arctic. [[Halibut]], [[cod]], [[herring]], and [[Alaska pollock]] (walleye pollock) are some other types of fish. In Antarctica there is not a lot of diversity among the fish; there is a lot of the same kind. [[Antarctic silverfish]] and [[lanternfish]] are some examples of fish that live in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pinniped|Seals]] are also found in polar regions and number around 2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 206&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to breed on land in the polar regions. [[Whale]]s are also in the polar regions and can be found near the surfaces of water where they prey.

There are also birds that breed in the polar regions. In the Arctic, 95% of the birds breeding here consist of only four different species. These include the [[northern fulmar]], [[kittiwake]], the [[little auk]] and the [[thick-billed murre]]. These birds breed here when the ice starts to thaw and when there is cracks in the ice so the birds are able to feed. In the Antarctic there are two different birds that live there including the [[penguin]] and the [[procellariiformes]].

== Vegetation ==
There is a wide source of vegetation in the polar region but there are few species in common in the southern and northern polar regions. The Arctic consists of desert and tundra vegetations. The desert vegetation consists of algae, [[lichen]]s, and mosses. Lichens are the most dominant plants. The ground is bare with patchy cover of lichens and mosses.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Flowering plants are also seen but not as common. It only contains 60 species of flowering plants. The Arctic tundra vegetation also consists of lichens and mosses, but it includes shrubs, [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[forb]]s as well. The amount of vegetation in the tundra consists on how much sun, or snow cover is in the area. The vegetation in this area may grow as tall as {{Convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. In the southern part of the Arctic there tend to be more shrubs whereas the northern parts there is less plant cover. In wet areas of the tundra there is tussock grasses and cotton grasses. In moist areas there are short grasses, mosses, [[willow]]s, and [[birch]]es.

The Antarctic vegetation consists of algae or lichens, and some bacteria and fungi. Mosses and lichens dominate though. The algae and lichens grow where there is moisture, and they hide in cracks to be protected from the wind. The dominate grassland is the tussock. These grasses get to be {{Convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, so they provide habitat for many [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Of the {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}} of land that makes up Antarctic, less than 2% of it does not have snow or ice.&lt;ref&gt;Bergstrom, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a type of vegetation is a [[crustose]] lichen. These lichens are found in moist areas that are hidden from wind. They hide on the surface of rocks in the cracks. They survive off the water that melts from above. These lichen occur in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], as well as Greenland and IceLand These lichens can be red or orange colored and are known to defoliate rocks.&lt;ref&gt;72 {{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
There exist many threats to the polar regions. One threat is whaling. Whaling started in the 16th century. People hunted whales to sell the meat. By 1925 the number of whales being killed rose from 14,000 to 40,000. The [[International Whaling Commission]] tried to stop whaling in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 192&lt;/ref&gt; but was unsuccessful.

[[Overfishing]] is another threat to the polar regions. In the [[Bering Sea]] there is a lot of fishing due to the high populations of halibut and Alaskan Pollock. Around the 1970s [[krill]] began to become a popular [[crustacean]] to catch. The [[Soviet Union]] started advertising food with krill in it and they started overfishing krill. It has been estimated that 40 tonnes of krill per hour were caught during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the [[exclusive economic zone]] was established. This said that a certain country can fish {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} off the shore. The country is now able to control who fishes in their EEZ area. But the EEZ has been unsuccessful.

Another threat is [[pollution]]. There are many land and water areas within the polar regions that are contaminated. This can be due to the transport of oil by large ships. [[Siberia]] is one example of a place that has had major pollution in its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttall, 529&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion on the [[ozone layer]] is one more threat. An [[ozone hole]] has been detected above Antarctica. The cause of the depletion of the ozone layer is due to [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. The other main reason is due to man made gases that are released into the atmosphere. There are many environmental effects due to this because the gases that are being released five times faster than they are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global warming]] is also having effect on the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Global warming is causing the temperature on the earth to increase. In ''Plan B 2.0'' [[Lester R. Brown]] talks about how the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the temperature in the Arctic region has increased by {{Convert|3|-|4|C-change|0}} within the last half century. And with the increase in temperatures some worry that this will cause the sea level to rise. Scientists believe that if the [[Greenland ice sheet]] melts then the sea level could rise by {{Convert|23|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The melting of this [[ice sheet]] or others could have an effect on [[ocean current]]s. It could cause lower temperatures in northern North America. Rising of the sea level will also impact coastal areas. One example is in [[Bangladesh]]. If there was a {{Convert|1|m|abbr=on}} increase in sea level then millions of people would have to migrate from the coast. Global warming is also affecting Antarctica. The [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] or Larsen A is an ice sheet on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The sheet broke in 1995, and then in 2000 an [[iceberg]] that is {{convert|4250|sqmi|abbr=on}} broke off the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Larsen B, which was {{Convert|5500|km2|abbr=on}}, broke off.

Global warming affects plants and animals. For plants, the warmer temperatures induce stress on the plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand&lt;/ref&gt; For animals, there has been a decrease in the number of [[polar bear]]s in the [[Hudson Bay]] area.&lt;ref name="sti294"/&gt; Since 1981, the polar bear population has been declining. This is because global warming causes the ice to break up faster so the polar bears are going to the coasts when there are poor conditions.&lt;ref name="sti294"&gt;Stirling, 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Whoever owns the land is responsible or managing it. And the owners of the land differ between the Antarctic and Arctic and also within the polar regions. In the Arctic, there are six nations that own the land about 60°N. These nations include: Canada, [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[United States|USA]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 193&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[Arctic cooperation and politics|international treaties]] set up so there are no disputes. These nations have also have set their government to manage the land properly. They have set up [[national park]]s, [[Wilderness area|land for wilderness]], and also land for research. In the polar regions there have been laws set up to manage the number of visitors. There have been rules set up allowing only a certain amount of mining done and other measures to protect the environment from damages.

In the Antarctic the owners of the land are less clear. Some areas of Antarctica are controlled by the French, while other areas are controlled by [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever owns Antarctic is still unclear therefore many other countries have put out scientific stations. The [[Antarctic Treaty System]] of 1961 was established to make sure all the conflicts were resolved about who owned the land. This and other treaties have shown interest in helping to conserve the Antarctic region. All of these countries have conservation laws. These laws manage the amount of hunting in the area, monitor invasive species, and control burning and settlement.

==Still unexplored?==
In a [[meta-analysis]] of the published work in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to still be unexplored. In addition, the north Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and [[Pacific Northwest]]), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world's [[Aquatic biodiversity research|aquatic biodiversity]]. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially [[marine ecosystem]]s where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases.&lt;ref&gt;Moustakas et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Polar Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world's aquatic biodiversity.

The term '''private-collective model of innovation''' was coined by [[Eric von Hippel]] and [[Georg von Krogh]] in their 2003 publication in ''[[Organization Science: A Journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|Organization Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eric von Hippel and Georg von Krogh (2003) "Open Source Software and the 'Private-Collective' Innovation Model: Issues for Organization Science" Organization Science 14, 209-223.&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation model represents a combination of the private investment model and the collective-action innovation model.

In the '''private investment model''' innovators appropriate financial returns from innovations through [[intellectual property rights]] such as patents, copyright, licenses, or trade secrets. Any [[knowledge spillover]] reduces the innovator's benefits, thus freely revealed knowledge is not in the interest of the innovator.

The '''[[Collective action|collective-action innovation model]]''' explains the creation of [[public goods]] which are defined by the non-rivalry of benefits and non-excludable access to the good. In this case the innovators do not benefit more than any one else not investing into the public good, thus [[Free rider problem|free-riding]] occurs. In response to this problem, the cost of innovation has to be distributed, therefore governments typically invest into public goods through public funding.

As combination of these two models, the private-collective model of innovation explains the creation of public goods through private funding. The model is based on the assumption that the innovators privately creating the public goods benefit more than the free-riders only consuming the public good. While the result of the investment is equally available to all, the innovators benefit through the ''process'' of creating the public good. Therefore, private-collective innovation occurs when the process-related rewards exceed the process-related costs.&lt;ref&gt;Democratizing innovation (2005) Eric von Hippel, MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg von Krogh (2008) "Researching the Private-Collective Innovation Model" The SAGE Handbook of New Approaches in Management and Organization, Daved Barry and Hans Hansen (ed.) Sage, 396-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

A laboratory study&lt;ref&gt;Gächter, S., von Krogh, G., Haefliger, S. "Initiating private-collective innovation: The fragility of knowledge sharing," Research Policy, 39(7), 2010, pp. 893-906.&lt;/ref&gt; traced the initiation of private-collective innovation to the first decision to share knowledge in a two-person game with multiple equilibria. The results indicate fragility: when individuals face opportunity costs to sharing their knowledge with others they quickly turn away from the social optimum of mutual sharing. The opportunity costs of the "second player", the second person deciding whether to share, have a bigger (negative) impact on knowledge sharing than the opportunity costs of the first person to decide. Overall, the study also observed sharing behavior in situations where none was predicted.

Recent work&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Helena Garriga, Efe Aksuyek, Georg F. von Krogh, Fredrik Hacklin, What social preferences matter in private-collective innovation? Behavioral game theory in collective action, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, Forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt; shows that a project will not "take off" unless the right incentives are in place for innovators to contribute their knowledge to open innovation from the beginning. The article&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; explores social preferences in the initiation of PCI. It conducted a simulation study that elucidates how inequality aversion, reciprocity, and fairness affect the underlying conditions that lead to the initiation of Private-collective innovation.

While firms increasingly seek to cooperate with outside individuals and organizations to tap into their ideas for new products and services, mechanisms that motivate innovators to "open up" are critical in achieving the benefits of open innovation.

The theory of private collective innovation has recently been extended by a study on the exclusion rights for technology in the competition between private-collective and other innovators.&lt;ref&gt;Alexy, O., Reitzig, M. "Private-collective innovation, competition, and firms' counterintuitive appropriation strategies", Research Policy, 42(4), 2013, pp. 895-913.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue that the investment in orphan exclusion rights for technology serves as a subtle coordination mechanism against alternative proprietary solutions.

Additionally, the research on private-collective innovation has been extended with theoretical explanations and empirical evidence of egoism and altruism as significant explanations for cooperation in private-collective innovation. Benbunan-Fich and Koufaris&lt;ref&gt;Benbunan-Fich, R., Koufaris, M., "Public contributions to private-collective systems: the case of social bookmarking", Internet Research, 23(2), 2013, pp. 183-203.&lt;/ref&gt; show that contributions to a social bookmarking site are a combination of intentional and unintentional contributions. The intentional public contribution of bookmarks is driven by an egoistic motivation to contribute valuable information and thus showing competence.

==Example: Development of Free and Libre Open Source Software==

The development of '''[[Open source|open source software]]''' / '''[[Free software|Free Software]]''' (consequently named Free and Libre Open Source Software – '''[[FLOSS]]''') is the most prominent example of private-collective innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Eric von Hippel and Georg von Krogh "Free revealing and the private-collective model of innovation incentives", R&amp;D Management, 36(3), 2006, pp. 295-306.&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, FLOSS represents a '''[[public good]]'''. It is [[Non-rivalrous|non-rival]] because copying and distributing software does not decrease its value. And it is [[non-excludable]] because FLOSS licenses enable everyone to use, change and redistribute the software without any restriction.

While FLOSS is created by many unpaid individuals, it has been shown&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Stuermer, Sebastian Spaeth, and Georg von Krogh, G. (2009) "Extending private-collective innovation: a case study" R&amp;D Management 39(2), 170-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Spaeth, Matthias Stuermer, Georg von Krogh (2010) "Enabling Knowledge Creation Through Outsiders: Towards a Push Model of Open Innovation" International Journal of Technology Management (Forthcoming Special Issue on Open Innovation).&lt;/ref&gt; that technology firms invest substantially in the development of FLOSS. These companies release previously proprietary software under FLOSS licenses, employ programmers to work on established FLOSS projects, and fund entrepreneurial firms to develop certain features. In this way, private entities invest into the creation of public goods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5014">'''RIVPACS''' (River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System) is an [[aquatic biomonitoring]] system for assessing [[water quality]] in freshwater rivers in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is based on the macroinvertebrate species (such as [[freshwater shrimp]], freshwater [[Freshwater sponge|sponge]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, worms, [[crayfish]], aquatic [[snail]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[freshwater mussel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[insect]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and many others) found at the study site during sampling. Some of these species are tolerant to [[pollution]], low dissolved oxygen, and other stressors, but others are sensitive; organisms vary in their tolerances. Therefore, different species will usually be found, in different proportions, at different river sites of varying quality. Some organisms are especially good [[indicator species]]. The species found at the reference sites collectively make up the species assemblage for that site and are the basis for a statistical comparison between reference sites and non-reference sites. The comparison between the expected species and the observed species can then be used to estimate this aspect of the ecological health of a river. 

The system is meant to be standardized, easy to use, and relatively low cost. It can complement other types of [[water quality]] monitoring such as chemical monitoring. RIVPACS supports the implementation of the [[Water Framework Directive]] as its official tool for macroinvertebrate classification&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/rivpacs-reference-database|title=RIVPACS reference database|last=Feeney|first=Anna|date=2014-12-18|work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference sites can be chosen and adjusted several ways. Usually they represent the best conditions within the region or area under study, and are a short stretch of river. Sometimes the reference site expectations are adjusted for degradation of the entire region by human impact. 'Pristine' [[freshwater]] sites are sampled to collect information on physical characteristics, chemistry, and [[macroinvertebrate]]s, sometimes several times each year&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This information is then used to predict what [[invertebrate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are present from samples of [[physiochemistry]] from other sites. 

RIVPACS is used across the UK and supported by [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]], [[Countryside Council for Wales]], [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], [[Natural England]], [[Environment Agency]], [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]], [[Freshwater Biological Association]], Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research, [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], [[South West Water]], and [[Welsh Assembly Government]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This classification of freshwater sites based on the macroinvertebrate [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] was first derived in 1977. Since then it has been developed and updated with addition of a wider range of freshwater sites.

[[Image:Carlofelice.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Teatro Carlo Felice]], designed by [[Aldo Rossi]], who is considered the founder of neo-rationalism]]
In architecture, '''rationalism''' is an architectural current which mostly developed from Italy in the 1920s-1930s. [[Vitruvius]] had claimed in his work ''[[De Architectura]]'' that architecture is a science that can be comprehended rationally. This formulation was taken up and further developed in the architectural treatises of the [[Renaissance]]. Progressive art theory of the 18th-century opposed the [[Baroque]] use of [[illusionism]] with the classic beauty of truth and reason.

Twentieth-century rationalism derived less from a special, unified theoretical work than from a common belief that the most varied problems posed by the real world could be resolved by reason. In that respect it represented a reaction to [[historicism (art)|historicism]] and a contrast to [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Expressionism]].

==Enlightenment rationalism==
[[Image:Étienne-Louis Boullée Memorial Newton Night.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Project for an [[Isaac Newton]] memorial by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]].]]
The name rationalism is retroactively applied to a movement in [[architecture]] that came about during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (more specifically, [[neoclassicism]]), arguing that architecture's intellectual base is primarily in science as opposed to reverence for and emulation of archaic traditions and beliefs. Rational architects, following the philosophy of [[René Descartes]] emphasized geometric forms and ideal proportions.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Broadbent |first1=Geoffrey |title=Emerging Concepts in Urban Space Design |year=1990 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold (International) |location=London |isbn=9780747600251}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81–84}}

The French Louis XVI style (better known as [[Neoclassicism]]) emerged in the mid-18th century with its roots in the waning interest of the Baroque period. The architectural notions of the time gravitated more and more to the belief that reason and natural forms are tied closely together, and that the rationality of science should serve as the basis for where structural members should be placed. Towards the end of the 18th century, [[Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand]], a teacher at the influential École Polytechnique in Paris at the time, argued that architecture in its entirety was based in science.

Other architectural theorists of the period who advanced rationalist ideas include Abbé [[Jean-Louis de Cordemoy]] (1631–1713),&lt;ref name="A History"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kostof |first1=Spiro |title=A History of Architecture: Settings and Rituals |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780195034721}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|559}}&lt;ref name="Emergence 2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lefaivre |first1=Liane |last2=Tzonis |first2=Alexander |title=The Emergence of Modern Architecture: A Documentary History from 1000 to 1810 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415260244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|265}} the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Carlo Lodoli]] (1690–1761),&lt;ref name="A History"/&gt;{{rp|560}} Abbé [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]] (1713–1769) and [[Quatremère de Quincy]] (1755–1849).&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|87–92}}

The architecture of [[Claude Nicholas Ledoux]] (1736–1806) and [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]] (1728–99) typify Enlightenment rationalism, with their use of pure geometric forms, including spheres, squares, and cylinders.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|92–96}}

==Structural rationalism==
The term structural rationalism most often refers to a 19th-century French movement, usually associated with the theorists [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] and [[Auguste Choisy]]. 
Viollet-le-Duc rejected the concept of an ideal architecture and instead saw architecture as a rational construction approach defined by the materials and purpose of the structure.
The architect [[Eugène Train]] was one of the most important practitioners of this school, particularly with his educational buildings such as the [[Collège Chaptal]] and [[Lycée Voltaire (Paris)|Lycée Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs in Paris Adapts to Meet the Twentieth Century |last1=Froissart-Pezone|first1=Rossella|last2=Wittman|first2=Richard|journal=Studies in the Decorative Arts |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=1999–2000|page=30

==Early 20th-century rationalism==
 [[Image:Como, ex casa del fascio 04.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The former Casa del Fascio in [[Como, Italy]], designed by [[Giuseppe Terragni]].]]

Architects such as [[Henri Labrouste]] and [[Auguste Perret]] incorporated the virtues of structural rationalism throughout the 19th century in their buildings. By the early 20th century, architects such as [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]] were exploring the idea that structure itself could create space without the need for decoration. This gave rise to [[modernism]], which further explored this concept. More specifically, the Soviet Modernist group [[ASNOVA]] were known as 'the Rationalists'.

Rational Architecture (Italian: ''Architettura razionale'') thrived in Italy from the 1920s to the 1940s. In 1926, a group of young architects – [[Sebastiano Larco]], [[Guido Frette]], [[Carlo Enrico Rava]], [[Adalberto Libera]], [[Luigi Figini]], [[Gino Pollini]], and [[Giuseppe Terragni]] (1904–43) founded the so-called [[Gruppo 7]], publishing their manifesto in the magazine ''Rassegna Italiana''. Their declared intent was to strike a middle ground between the classicism of the ''[[Novecento Italiano]]'' movement and the industrially inspired architecture of [[Futurism]].&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frampton |first=Kenneth |year=2007 |title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=New York |isbn=9780500203958}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|203}} Their "note" declared:

{{quote|The hallmark of the earlier avant garde was a contrived impetus and a vain, destructive fury, mingling good and bad elements: the hallmark of today's youth is a desire for lucidity and wisdom...This must be clear...we do not intend to break with tradition...The new architecture, the true architecture, should be the result of a close association between logic and rationality.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|203}}}}
[[Image:Palazzo_Gualino_in_Turin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Palazzo Gualino, under renovation, in [[Turin, Italy]] ]]
One of the first rationalist buildings was the [[Palazzo Gualino]] in [[Turin]], built for the financier [[Riccardo Gualino]] by the architects [[Gino Levi-Montalcini]] and [[Giuseppe Pagano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museotorino.it/view/s/9286e70e9b4c47c9828e92515148173e |title=Palazzo Gualino |publisher=MuseoTorino |accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gruppo 7 mounted three exhibitions between 1926 and 1931, and the movement constituted itself as an official body, the Movimento Italiano per l'Architettura Razionale (MIAR), in 1930. Exemplary works include Giuseppe Terragni's [[Casa del Fascio (Como)|Casa del Fascio]] in [[Como]] (1932–36), The Medaglia d'Oro room at the Italian Aeronautical Show in Milan (1934) by Pagano and [[Marcello Nizzoli]], and the Fascist Trades Union Building in [[Como]] (1938–43), designed by Cesare Cattaneo, Pietro Lingeri, Augusto Magnani, L. Origoni, and Mario Terragni.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|205–9}}

Pagano became editor of ''[[Casabella]]'' in 1933 together with Edoardo Persico. Pagano and Persico featured the work of the rationalists in the magazine, and its editorials urged the Italian state to adopt rationalism as its official style. The Rationalists enjoyed some official commissions from the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini, but the state tended to favor the more classically inspired work of the National Union of Architects. Architects associated with the movement collaborated on large official projects of the Mussolini regime, including the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] (begun in 1932) and the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]] (EUR) in the southern part of [[Rome]] (begun in 1936). The EUR features monumental buildings, many of which evocative of ancient Roman architecture, but absent ornament, revealing strong geometric forms.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|204–7}}

==Neo-rationalism==
In the late 1960s, a new rationalist movement emerged in architecture, claiming inspiration from both the Enlightenment and early-20th-century rationalists. Like the earlier rationalists, the movement, known as the Tendenza, was centered in Italy. Practitioners include [[Carlo Aymonino]] (1926–2010), [[Aldo Rossi]] (1931–97), and [[Giorgio Grassi]]. The Italian design magazine ''Casabella'' featured the work of these architects and theorists. The work of architectural historian [[Manfredo Tafuri]] influenced the movement, and the [[University Iuav of Venice]] emerged as a center of the Tendenza after Tafuri became chair of Architecture History in 1968.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|157 et seq.}} A Tendenza exhibition was organized for the 1973 [[Milan Triennale]].&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|178–183}}

Rossi's book ''L'architettura della città'', published in 1966, and translated into English as ''The Architecture of the City'' in 1982, explored several of the ideas that inform Neo-rationalism. In seeking to develop an understanding of the city beyond simple functionalism, Rossi revives the idea of [[typology (urban planning and architecture)|typology]], following from Quatremère de Quincy, as a method for understanding buildings, as well as the larger city. He also writes of the importance of monuments as expressions of the collective memory of the city, and the idea of place as an expression of both physical reality and history.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|166–72}}&lt;ref name="Post-Modernism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jencks |first1=Charles |title=Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture |year=1987 |publisher=Rizzoli |location=New York |isbn=9780847808359}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178–80}}

Architects such as [[Leon Krier]], [[Maurice Culot]], and [[Demetri Porphyrios]] took Rossi's ideas to their logical conclusion with a revival of Classical Architecture and Traditional Urbanism.  Krier's witty critique of Modernism, often in the form of cartoons, and Porphyrios's well crafted philosophical arguments, such as "Classicism is not a Style", won over a small but talented group of architects to the classical point of view.  Organizations such as the Traditional Architecture Group at the [[RIBA]], and the [[Institute of Classical Architecture]] attest to their growing number, but mask the Rationalist origins.

In Germany, [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]] became the leading practitioner of German rationalism from the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="Post-Modernism"/&gt;{{rp|178–80}} Ungers influenced a younger generation of German architects, including [[Hans Kollhoff]], [[Max Dudler]], and [[Christoph Mäckler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Durth |first1=Werner |last2=May |first2=Roland |title=Schinkel's Order: Rationalist Tendencies in German Architecture |journal=Architectural Design |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=London |date=September 2007 |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=44–49 |doi=10.1002/ad.514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8154">{{sociology}}
'''Sociomusicology''' (from [[Latin]]: ''socius'', "companion"; from [[Old French]] ''musique''; and the suffix ''-ology'', "the study of", from Old Greek λόγος, ''lógos'' : "discourse"), also called '''music sociology''' or the '''sociology of music''', refers to both an academic [[Subfields of sociology|subfield]] of [[sociology]] that is concerned with [[music]] (often in combination with other arts), as well as a subfield of [[musicology]] that focuses on social aspects of musical behavior and the role of music in [[society]].

==Sociomusicological issues==
The work of scholars in sociomusicology is often similar to [[ethnomusicology]] in terms of its exploration of the sociocultural context of music; however, sociomusicology maintains less of an emphasis on ethnic and national identity, and is not limited to ethnographic methods. Rather, sociomusicologists use a wide range of [[research methods]] and take a strong interest in observable behavior and musical interactions within the constraints of [[social structure]]. Sociomusicologists are more likely than ethnomusicologists to make use of surveys and economic data, for example, and tend to focus on musical practices in contemporary industrialized societies. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of "Biliterate and Trimusical" in Hong Kong sociomusicology (cf. Ko, C. K. S. (2011). An analysis of sociomusicology, its issues; and the music and society in Hong Kong. Hong Kong: Ko Ka Shing. This book {{ISBN|9789881580214}} has been selected for inclusion in the Association for Chinese Music Research Bibliography in 2012, see http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/23174.)

Since the field of musicology has tended to emphasize [[historiographic]] and analytical/critical rather than sociological approaches to [[research]], sociomusicology is still regarded as somewhat outside the mainstream of musicology. Yet, with the increased popularity of [[ethnomusicology]] in recent decades (with which the field shares many similarities), as well as the development and mainstreaming of "[[New Musicology]]" (coinciding with the emergence of interdisciplinary [[Cultural Studies]] in academia), sociomusicology is increasingly coming into its own as a fully established field.The values and meanings associated with music are collectively constructed by both music listeners and performers. When listening to a piece, they reflect upon their own values and use the music to make connections between their own experiences and what the piece is perceived as communicating. The sociology of music looks specifically at these connections and the musical experiences tied to the person and the music itself.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine ELLIS, An Introduction to Music Studies, Chapter 3: ‘The Sociology of Music’. Pg. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most notable classical sociologists to examine the social aspects and effects of music were [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918), [[Alfred Schutz]] (1899–1959), [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) and [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969). Others have included [[Alphons Silbermann]], [[Charles Seeger]] (1886–1979), [[Howard Saul Becker]], [[Norbert Elias]], [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Jacques Attali]], John Mueller (1895–1965), and [[Christopher Small]]. Contemporary sociomusicologists include [[Tia DeNora]], Georgina Born, [[David G. Hebert|David Hebert]], Peter Martin, Timothy Dowd and Joseph Schloss.

'''Soviet art''' is the [[visual art]] that was produced in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==

During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935–1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called ‘social order’. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Русов, Лев Александрович|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:Орешников, Виктор Михайлович|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Тимков, Николай Ефимович|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:Овчинников, Владимир Иванович|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:Осипов, Сергей Иванович|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Александр Михайлович|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Арсений Никифорович|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:Позднеев, Николай Матвеевич|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians – become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artists’ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world. Among others, the collection content works of Bachtschanjan Vagritsch, Jankilevskij Wladimir,Rabin  Oskar, Batschurin Ewganij, Kabakov Ilja, Schablavin Sergei, Belenok Piotr, Krasnopevcev Dimitrij, Schdanov Alexander, [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]],
Bitt Galina, Kropivnitzkaja Walentina, Schemjakin Michail, Bobrowskaja Olga, Kropivnitzkij Lew,Schwarzman  Michail, Borisov  Leonid, Kropiwnizkij Jewgenij, Sidur  Vadim, Bruskin Grischa, Kulakov  Michail, Sitnikov  Wasili, and many others.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">'''Technological somnambulism''' is a concept used when talking about the [[philosophy of technology]]. The term was used by [[Langdon Winner]] in his essay ''Technology as forms of life''. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of ''sleepwalking'' in our mediations with [[technology]]. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors.  One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again.  Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from technology, and so we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way in which technology seems to create new ''worlds'' in which we live. These worlds are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of &lt;!--using that--&gt;the technology (Winner 105-107).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "[http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Nature_Technology_and_Society_Fall_2010/Winner_Ttechnologies_as_Forms_of_Life.pdf Technologies as Forms of Life]". ''Readings in the Philosophy of Technology''. David M. Kaplan. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0742564015}}. 103-113&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be found in the earlier work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], cf. ''[[Understanding Media]]'', where he refers to a comment made by [[David Sarnoff]] expressing a [[social determinism|socially deterministic]] view of "value free" technology whose value is solely defined by its usage as representing, "...the voice of the current somnambulism".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that this piece by McLuhan has become standard reading in [[Media Theory]] it is reasonable to suspect that Winner encountered the concept there or elsewhere and then went on to develop it further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.gatech.edu/je77/222|title=Media Theory Reading List|website=home.cc.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/reading/montgomery.htm|title=Media Theory Reading List -- Harper Montgomery|website=csmt.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | title=Media Digital Humanities | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603180344/http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | archivedate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7379">The '''Hartwell Paper''' called for a reorientation of [[climate policy]] after the perceived failure in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 of the UNFCCC climate conference in Copenhagen]]. It was a response to the [[United Nations]]' [[Kyoto Protocol]], a previous international agreement meant to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The paper was published in May 2010 by the [[London School of Economics]] in cooperation with the [[University of Oxford]]. The authors are 14 natural and social scientists from Asia, Europe and North America, including [[Mike Hulme]], [[Roger A. Pielke (Jr)]], [[Nico Stehr]] and [[Steve Rayner]], who met under the [[Chatham House Rule]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf|title=The Hartwell Paper|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors saw the [[Great Recession|2009 economic crisis]] as an opportunity to re-evaluate global priorities. They argued that "decarbonisation will only be achieved successfully as a benefit contingent upon other goals which are politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic."

[[File:Hartwell House, Bucks.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], where the meetings took place.]]

They emphasize [[human dignity]] as a necessary guiding principle for climate [[Climate policy|policy]]: "To reframe the climate issue around matters of human dignity is not just noble or necessary. It is also likely to be more effective than the approach of framing around human sinfulness – which has failed and will continue to fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 EU Climate Policy after the Crash of 09.] The European Business Review, September 2010 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325063036/http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle of human dignity is expanded to three main objectives:
* 1. Energy access for all - the paper advocates taking investments in the innovations of renewable energy to decrease energy costs and to make them more affordable to society. Only this diversification of energy could extend the access to energy, especially in undeveloped countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* 2. Development that does not interfere with essential Earth systems.
* 3. Societies well equipped to withstand climate-related dangers.

Their ultimate goal is "to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less than those using [[fossil fuels]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/theHartwellPaper The Hartwell Paper.] [[London School of Economics]], May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=16099521 Oblique strategies], [[The Economist]], 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8673828.stm After the crash - a new direction for climate policy.] BBC News, 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hartwell Paper recommends that they are to achieve this goal by introducing low [[carbon]] [[Carbon tax|taxes]]. However, this money is able to be used to develop a CO2 free energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Kyoto and Climate Change Misconceptions ==

"The previous 'Kyoto' model has dangerously narrowed the option space for thinking seriously and realistically about energy and environmental policies. The Hartwell Paper wishes to contribute to a new pragmatism in the policy discourse surrounding climate change. To this end, we gathered at Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire in February 2010 and this paper is the base of our work".

The Hartwell Paper argues that, although we should attempt to reduce climate change, we must also prepare to adapt if necessary. According to the authors, the Kyoto principles implied that adaptation to the environment should be seen as a failure to halt climate change. Those at the Hartwell meeting proposed that these strategies; mitigation, and adaptation, should both be employed. This is to keep in mind the dignity of those who would be most affected while simultaneously slowing global warming.

The following are climate myths presented in the paper:
* '''Climate change is a problem that must be solved''' - "Rather than being a discrete problem to be solved. Climate change is better understood as a persistent condition that must be coped with and can only be partially managed more – or less – well. It is just one part of a larger complex of such conditions encompassing population, technology, wealth disparities, resource use, etc."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* '''The "deficit model" of science''' - The idea that the lack of information hinders the making of environmental progress. Once the science is understood by all, an agreement can be reached. The Hartwell authors call this a myth, saying that it doesn't address the varying political and religious ideologies that can result in differing interpretations of scientific data. "In turn, this error has led to the common and flawed assumption that the solutions to climate change should be ‘science driven’ as if a shared understanding of science will lead to a political consensus."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Key Features of Hartwell Plan ==

The authors propose a holistic model of environmental practice. They believe there has been too much emphasis placed on carbon dioxide as if it is our only problematic emission. They state that while the CO2 reduction is central to the plan, smaller changes in a variety of practices and industries are also important.
* Diversification and moving away from fossil fuels
* Eradication of "Black Carbon" - Black Carbon is simply soot, which can come from burning wood or coal within the home. This has an environmental effect far greater (per ton) than simple CO2. According to the authors, this is an important step to take, as it should be much easier than phasing out gasoline.
* Reduce Tropospheric Ozone
* Protect Tropical Forests
* The "Kaya Identity" - these are four primary factors when it comes to a region's environmental footprint. They are population, wealth, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. Nations face different environmental issues, and the solution for one is not the solution for all.

== Reception and Criticism ==

The Hartwell Paper has received both praise and criticism. According to The Economist, the Hartwell approach to decarbonisation has been a source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16099521|title=Oblique strategies|date=2010-05-11|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-04|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because large, rapidly industrializing nations are driven by fossil fuels, the authors claim that slowing this process just isn't politically feasible. ''The Economist'' article argues that Hartwell's "oblique strategies" may be more difficult to turn into policy than a more direct attack on carbon dioxide emissions.

In those Greek festivals there erupts what one might call a [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] tendency in nature, as if it had cause to sigh over its [[Sparagmos|dismemberment]] into [[Individuation|individuals]]’.}}  While many [[culture]]s have developed forms that provoke this [[paradox]]ical response, the term ''tragedy'' often refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 14–16}}  That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | p = 16}}

From its origins in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]] to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg]]; [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering; [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon; and [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]'s incorporation of tragic pathos in his nonfiction film, ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' (2012), tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 13–84}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}  A long line of [[philosophers]]—which includes [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]],{{Sfn | Benjamin | 1998}} [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]{{Sfn | Deleuze | Guattari | 1972}}—have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.{{Sfn | Felski | 2008 | p = 1}}{{Sfn | Dukore | 1974 | ps =: primary material.}}{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}

In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}{{Sfn | Pfister | 1977}}{{Sfn | Elam | 1980}}  [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization|deterritorialisation]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}

[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]
The word "tragedy" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang |grc|τραγῳδία}}, [[sandhi|contracted]] from ''trag(o)-aoidiā'' = "[[goat]] [[Ode|song]]", which comes from ''tragos'' = "he-goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing" (''[[cf.]]'' "ode"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize&lt;ref&gt;See [[Horace]], ''Epistulae'', II, 3, 220: "Carmino qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum".&lt;/ref&gt; in a competition of [[Greek dances|choral dancing]] or was that around which a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] danced prior to the animal's [[ritual]] [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}  In another view on the etymology, [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] (2nd–3rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was ''trygodia'' from ''trygos'' (grape harvest) and ''ode'' (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0071&amp;id=Literature.AthV1&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide%20 | first = Athenaeus | last = of Naucratis | title = The deipnosophists | publisher = Wisc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 335 BCE (long after the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of [[Classical Greece|5th-century]] [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] tragedy), [[Aristotle]] provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the [[drama]]tic [[The arts|art form]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', in which he argues that tragedy developed from the [[improvisation]]s of the leader of [[Greek chorus|choral]] [[dithyramb]]s ([[hymn]]s sung and danced in praise of [[Dionysos]], the god of wine and fertility):{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}
{{Quote |Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature. | Poetics IV, 1449a 10–15{{Sfn | Janko | 1987 | p = 6}}}}

In the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:
{{Quote |Tragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief ([[catharsis]]) to such [and similar] emotions. | Poetics, VI 1449b 2–3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Aristotle, Poetics, section 1449b | publisher = Tufts | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} A common descent from pre-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] fertility and burial rites has been suggested.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like [[satyr]]s in the original [[dithyramb]]s from which the tragic genre developed.

Scott Scullion writes:  {{quote|There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as "song for the prize goat". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 ("he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: "Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: "They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat"...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Scullion: "Tragedy and Religion: The Problem of Origins", in Gregory (ed.), A Companion to Greek Tragedy, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdTuNrx6z4oC&amp;q=%22There+is+abundant+ancient+evidence%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22There%20is%20abundant%20ancient%20evidence%22&amp;f=false p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 441}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pages = 3–5}}{{Sfn | Goldhill | 1997 | p = 54}}{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 206}}{{Sfn | Styan | 2000 | p = 140}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | p = 104 | ps =: “most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct”.}}  Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 32–3}}{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 444}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pp = 3–5, 33 | ps =: [although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honored their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]].

Athenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a [[satyr play]].{{sfn|Lucas|1954|p=7}} The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the ''[[Oresteia]]'' of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 33–34}}

All of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]'') and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A [[Greek chorus]] danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe ("turning, circling"), antistrophe ("counter-turning, counter-circling") and epode ("after-song").

Many ancient Greek tragedians employed the ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'' as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ''ekkyklêma'' is after the murder of [[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]] in the first play of Aeschylus' ''Oresteia'', when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ''ekkyklêma'' are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the [[mechane]], which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase "[[deus ex machina]]" ("god out of a machine"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BCE, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek tragedy]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}  From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached England.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 36, 47}}  While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].}}  [[Livius Andronicus]] began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies).{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 49}}

From the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}  Nine of [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca's tragedies]] survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 49–50}}  Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}

Seneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at [[elite]] gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective [[soliloquies]]. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of [[Revenge tragedy|revenge]], the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.

===Influence of Greek and Roman===
Classical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. [[Medieval theatre]] was dominated by [[mystery play]]s, [[morality play]]s, [[farce]]s and [[miracle play]]s. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the [[Padua]]n [[Lovato Lovati|Lovato de' Lovati]] (1241–1309).&lt;ref name=lovati&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lovato-de-lovati/ "Lovati, Lovato de'"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil [[Albertino Mussato]] (1261–1329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the [[Latin verse]] tragedy ''Eccerinis'', which uses the story of the tyrant [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] to highlight the danger to Padua posed by [[Cangrande della Scala]] of [[Verona]].&lt;ref name=muss&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/albertino-mussato// "Mussato, Albertino"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the ''Achilles'' written before 1390 by [[Antonio Loschi]] of [[Vicenza]] (c.1365–1441) and the ''Progne'' of the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Gregorio Correr]] (1409–1464) which dates from 1428–29.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Drama", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', eleventh edition, Vol. '''VIII''', p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515 [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] (1478–1550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy ''Sophonisba'' in the [[vernacular]] that would later be called [[Italian language|Italian]]. Drawn from [[Livy]]'s account of [[Sophonisba]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the ''Oreste'' and ''Rosmunda'' of Trissino's friend, the Florentine [[Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai]] (1475–1525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, ''Rosmunda'' on the ''[[Hecuba]]'' of [[Euripides]],  and ''Oreste'' on the ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' of the same author; like ''Sophonisba'', they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) [[hendecasyllable]]s. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is ''A Castro'', by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet and playwright [[António Ferreira]], written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of [[Inês de Castro]], one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history.   Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: ''Pamfila'' or ''Filostrato e Panfila'' written in 1498 or 1508 by [[Antonio Cammelli]] (Antonio da Pistoia); and a ''Sophonisba'' by [[Galeotto del Carretto]] of 1502.&lt;ref name=hallam&gt;Henry Hallam (1837) [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8JMAAAAcAAJ ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''].

From about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of [[Sophocles]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Euripides]], as well as comedic writers such as [[Aristophanes]], [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], were available in Europe and the next forty years saw [[Humanism|humanists]] and poets translating and adapting their tragedies.  In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.

The most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the precepts of [[Horace]] and [[Aristotle]] (and contemporary commentaries by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]), although plots were taken from classical authors such as [[Plutarch]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors ([[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the [[Spanish Golden Age]] playwrights [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Tirso de Molina]] and [[Lope de Vega]], many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.

The common forms are the:
* ''Tragedy of circumstance'': people  are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs
* ''Tragedy of miscalculation'': the [[protagonist]]'s error of judgement has tragic consequences
* ''[[Revenge play]]''

In English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of [[William Shakespeare]] and his [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:
* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''
* ''[[Coriolanus]]''
* ''[[Hamlet]]''
* ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''
* ''[[King Lear]]''
* ''[[Macbeth]]''
* ''[[Othello]]''
* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''
* ''[[Timon of Athens]]''
* ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''
* ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''

A contemporary of Shakespeare, [[Christopher Marlowe]], also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:
* ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]''
* ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''

[[John Webster]] (1580?–1635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:
* ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''
* ''[[The White Devil]]''

===Opera===
Contemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy.  [[Jacopo Peri]], in the preface to his ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' refers to "the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage)."{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 22}}  The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of [[opera]]. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] to about that of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] were not called opera, but ''tragédie en musique'' ("tragedy in music") or some similar name; the ''tragédie en musique'' is regarded as a distinct musical genre.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Graham Sadler, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/44040 "Tragédie en musique"], Grove Music Online (subscription required). Accessed March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some later operatic [[composer]]s have also shared Peri's aims: [[Richard Wagner]]'s concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' ("integrated work of art"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama.{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 178}} [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.

[[File:Talma as Nero in Britannicus by Racine - Delacroix - zeno.jpg|thumb|190px|French actor [[François-Joseph Talma|Talma]] as Nero in Racine's ''[[Britannicus (play)|Britannicus]].]]
For much of the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like ''Medée'' (1635) and ''Le Cid'' (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of ''Le Cid'' was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:
* The stage—in both comedy and tragedy—should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).
* Tragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.
* Although [[Aristotle]] says that [[catharsis]] (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.

Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called "heroic comedies") and many continued to be successes, although the "irregularities" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.

[[Jean Racine]]'s tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of [[pathos]] and amorous passion (like [[Phèdre]]'s love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays ("Esther" and "Athalie") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, ''[[Bérénice]]'', was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.

{{further|Bourgeois tragedy|Augustan drama}}

Bourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, [[George Lillo]]'s ''The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell'', which was first performed in 1731. Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''Miss Sara Sampson'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany.

==Modern development==
In [[modernist literature]], the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. [[Arthur Miller]]'s essay "Tragedy and the Common Man" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings.{{sfn|Miller|1949|p=894}} British playwright [[Howard Barker]] has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume ''[[Arguments for a Theatre]]''. "You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool," he insists.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} Critics such as [[George Steiner]] have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In ''The Death of Tragedy'' (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that ‘the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and “realistic” criteria.’ In part, this feature of Shakespeare’s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was ‘so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.’ When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare’s forms are ‘richer but hybrid'.&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, ''The Death of Tragedy'' [1961] (Oxford University Press, 1980; Yale University Press, 1996), p. xiii. See also George Steiner, ‘ “Tragedy.” Reconsidered.’ ''New Literary History'' 35:1 (Winter 2004), pp. 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
===Aristotle===
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his work [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] that
tragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great [[person]] who experiences a reversal of [[luck|fortune]] (''[[Peripeteia]]''). Aristotle's [[definition]] can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but he says that the change from good to bad as in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is preferable because this induces [[pity]] and [[fear]] within the spectators. Tragedy results in a [[catharsis]] (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.

According to [[Aristotle]], "the [[structure]] of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing [[fear]] and [[pity]]—for that is peculiar to this form of art."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Trans. W.H. Fyfe. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1932. Section 1452b&lt;/ref&gt;  This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's ''[[hamartia]]'', which is often translated as either a [[character flaw]], or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to ''hamartanein'', a sporting term that refers to an [[archery|archer]] or [[spear]]-thrower missing his target).&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Amelie Oksenberg. ''[[Literary criticism|Essays on Aristotle’s Poetics]]''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1992. Page 178&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], "The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty."&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt;  The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the [[law]], the [[god]]s, [[destiny|fate]], or [[society]]), but if a character’s downfall is brought about by an external cause, [[Aristotle]] describes this as a [[misadventure]] and not a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics''. Section 1135b&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition ([[anagnorisis]]--"knowing again" or "knowing back" or "knowing throughout") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition "a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate."

In ''Poetics'', Aristotle gave the following definition in [[ancient Greek]] of the word "tragedy" (τραγῳδία):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1449b&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν."

which means ''Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.''

Common usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tragedy the [[narrative|story]] must fit the set of requirements as laid out by ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.  By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions — psychological or religious — which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death.&lt;ref&gt;Chiari, J. ''Landmarks of Contemporary Drama''. [[London]]: [[Jenkins (publisher)|Jenkins]], 1965. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what constitutes a "tragedy", however, is a frequently debated matter.

According to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:

1. Complex, which involves [[Peripety]] and [[Discovery (fiction)|Discovery]]

2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions

3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and [[Peleus]]

4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are [[Graeae|Phorcides]] and [[Prometheus]]

===Hegel===
[[G.W.F. Hegel]], the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to [[epistemology]] and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay "Hegel's Theory of Tragedy," [[A.C. Bradley]] first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the "[[tragic collision]]", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the "[[tragic hero]]" and his or her "hamartia" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone.{{Sfn | Bradley | 2007 | pp = 114–56}} Hegel himself, however, in his seminal "[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:
{{Quote |The heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [''gleichberechtigt''] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity  decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | pp = 567–8}}}}

Hegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: "Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside."{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | p = 572}}

==Similar dramatic forms in world theatre==
===Ancient Indian drama===
The writer [[Bharata Muni]], in his work on [[dramatic theory]] ''[[Natya Shastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Nātyaśāstra'', नाट्य शास्त्र, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE),{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 517}} identified several ''[[Rasa (art)|rasas]]'' (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the [[Sanskrit drama]] of [[History of India|ancient India]]. The text also suggests the notion of [[musical mode]]s or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as [[raga]]s. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes [[gandhara]] or [[rishabha]] are said to provoke "sadness" or "pathos" (''karuna rasa'') whereas [[rishabha]] evokes heroism (''vira rasa''). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text ''[[Dattilam]]'', composed around the same time as the ''Treatise''.

The celebrated ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]], ''[[Mahabharata]]'', can also be related to tragedy in some ways.  According to [[Hermann Oldenberg]], the original epic once carried an immense "tragic force".&lt;ref name = Oldenberg&gt;{{Citation | first = Hermann | last = Oldenberg | author-link = Hermann Oldenberg | year = 1922 | title = Das Mahabharata | place = Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the ''Mahabharata'' into dramatic form.

'''Variantology''' has been conceived as an international research project with the aim of developing a critical appraisal of the established concepts of “[[Mass media|media]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variantology.com/|title=Vilém Flusser Archiv|website=Variantology.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a medium is thus opened up to approaches and disciplines that up to now have remained outside the contemporary discourse on media, such as [[theology]], various [[musicology]], aspects of [[natural sciences]], [[fine arts]] or [[classical philology]]. Furthermore, it is opened up to cultures of knowledge that have long been excluded from the western discourse, like the oriental and Arabic-Islamic culture. Variantology also attempts to explore how reciprocally these disciplines then become open to thinking in categories and terms of media and [[communication]]. Consequently, the network of research that constitutes the Variantology project involves scholars based in academic institutions as well as artists, musicians and authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entropie.digital.udk-berlin.de/wiki/Variantology]  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711031153/http://entropie.digital.udk-berlin.de/wiki/Variantology |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical basis ==
To come to a different understanding of media, a central part of research is the development of a network of scientists, artists and scholars who are engaged with the "deep time relations“ between arts, sciences, and technologies. The term "deep time relations“ refers to the notion of being a plurality of traversals through the genealogy of what we call media today.&lt;ref&gt;"Deep Time" is a term coined in palaeontological studies, especially by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[John McPhee]].&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying theoretical center is [[Michel Foucault]]’s concept of genealogy,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Nietzsche, Genealogy, History.” in: Paul Rabinow (Editor). The Foucault Reader. Vintage. 1984. {{ISBN|0-394-71340-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he developed from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]’s thinking about morality as a historical- and social-generated construction.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. On the Genealogy of Morals. Oxford University Press. 2009. {{ISBN|0-19-953708-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault's approach in this connection was to comprehend history as a constitution of knowledge, of discourses, of objectification and so on, detached from an idea of historical subjects and previously unquestioned categories of western (Eurocentric) culture and power.

== Workshops and publications ==
An integral part of the project is the annual international workshop. The first three Variantology workshops were held at [[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]], the fourth one at [[UdK]] in Berlin, and the 5th at [[Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III]] in Naples, Italy.

'''Visual communication''' is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be seen. Visual communication in part or whole relies on [[Eye|eyesight]].&lt;ref&gt;David Sless (1981). ''Learning and Visual Communication''. p.187&lt;/ref&gt; Visual communication is a broad spectrum that includes [[signage|sign]]s, [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], [[industrial design]], [[advertising]], [[animation]], [[color]], and electronic resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Louis Smith (2005). ''Handbook of Visual Communication: Theory, Methods, and Media''. p.123.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The evaluation of a good [[Visual design|visual communication design]] is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience,&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Frascara (2004). ''Communication design: principles, methods, and practice''. p.68&lt;/ref&gt; not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of aesthetics. Besides [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, there are other ways to express information visually - [[gestures]] and body language, animation (digital or analogue), and film. Visual communication by [[e-mail]], a textual medium, is commonly expressed with [[ASCII art]], [[emoticon]]s, and embedded [[digital image]]s.
[[File:Eye of Horus bw.svg|thumb|right|The Eye of Horus]]
The term 'visual presentation'&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, G. H. ''Visual Communication: More Than Meets the Eye''. Bristol: Intellect Books, 2007.  {{ISBN|978-1-84150-141-3}}. p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically-oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] also use methods of visual communication in their professional practice. Visual communication on the [[World Wide Web]] is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses the eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.The [[Eye of Horus]] is often referred to as the symbol of visual communication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} It is said to be a representation of an eclipse, as the cornea around the pupil is like the cornea around the sun during a solar eclipse.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Important figures===
[[Aldous Huxley]] is highly regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[The Art of Seeing]]''. He described "seeing" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is "The more you see, the more you know."

[[Max Wertheimer]] is said to be the father of [[Gestalt psychology]]. Gestalt means ''form'' or ''shape'' in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or color and proximity. Looking for continuation, closure, and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Study==
Students studying visual communication&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Louis Smith (2005). ''Handbook of visual communication: theory, methods, and media''. [[Routledge]]. p. 12.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; are taught the basic physics of light, anatomy and physiology of the eye, cognitive and perception theories, colour theories, [[Gestalt psychology]], aesthetics, natural reading patterns, design principles, [[semiotics]], persuasion, camera/filming actions and image-types, and so forth. Colleges for visual communications differ in their approach, but most combine theory and practice in some form.

Visual communication takes place through [[picture]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]] and [[chart]]s, as well as through [[sign]]s, signals and [[symbol]]s. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.

==Image analysis==
Visual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires analysis. Images can be analysed though many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by [[Paul Martin Lester]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Martin Lester]].  ''Visual Communication: Images with Messages''. Belmont, CA: [[Thomson Wadsworth]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-534-63720-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Personal perspective:
When a viewer has an opinion about an image based on their personal thoughts. Personal response depends on the viewer’s thoughts and values individually. This might be sometimes in conflict with cultural values. Also when a viewer has viewed an image with a personal perspective, it is hard to change the view of the image on the viewer, and the image can even be seen in other ways.

;Historical perspective:
An image’s view can be arising from the history of the use media. Through times sort images have been changed, because the use of different (new) media. For example: The result of using the computer to edit images (e.g. Photoshop) is quite different when comparing images that are made and edited by craft.

;Technical perspective:
When the view of an image is influenced by the use of lights, position and the presentation of the image. The right use of light, position and presentation of the image can improve the view of the image. It makes the image looks better than the reality.

;Ethical perspective:
From this perspective, the maker of the image, the viewer and the image itself must be responsible morally and ethically to the image. This perspective is also categorized in six categories: [[categorical imperative]], utilitarianism, hedonism, golden mean, golden rule and veil of ignorance.

;Cultural perspective:
Symbolization is an important definition for this perspective. Cultural perspective involves identity of symbols.  The uses of words that are related with the image, the use of heroes in the image, etc. are the symbolization of the image. The cultural perspective can also be seen as the semiotic perspective.

;Critical perspective:
The view of images in the critical perspective is when the viewers criticise the images, but the critics have been made in interests of the society, although an individual makes the critics.  This way this perspective differs from the personal perspective.

==Visual aids==
'''Visual aids''' are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to [[PowerPoint]]s. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. Each type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction. Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience. The purpose of the visual aid is to ''enhance'' the presentation.&lt;ref name="berengueres_2015"&gt;{{cite book | last = Berengueres | first = Jose | year = 2015 | title = Sketch Thinking | publisher = Stokes Hamilton | location = Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual elements==
'''Objects'''
* The use of objects as visual aids involves bringing the actual object to demonstrate on during the speech. For example, a speech about tying knots would be more effective by bringing in a rope.
* '''Pro''': the use of the actual object is often necessary when demonstrating how to do something so that the audience can fully understand procedure.
* '''Con''': some objects are too large or unavailable for a speaker to bring with them.

'''Models'''
* Models are representations of another object that serve to demonstrate that object when use of the real object is ineffective for some reason.  Examples include human skeletal systems, the solar system, or architecture.
* '''Pros''': models can serve as substitutes that provide a better example of the real thing to the audience when the object being spoken about is of an awkward size or composure for use in the demonstration.
* '''Cons''': sometimes a model may take away from the reality of what is being spoken about. For example, the vast size of the solar system cannot be seen from a model, and the actual composure of a human body cannot be seen from a dummy.

'''Graphs'''
* Graphs are used to visualize relationships between different quantities. Various types are used as visual aids, including bar graphs, line graphs, pie graphs, and scatter plots.
* '''Pros''': graphs help the audience to visualize statistics so that they make a greater impact than just listing them verbally would.
* '''Cons''': graphs can easily become cluttered during use in a speech by including too much detail, overwhelming the audience and making the graph ineffective.

'''Maps'''
* Maps show geographic areas that are of interest to the speech. They often are used as aids when speaking of differences between geographical areas or showing the location of something.
* '''Pros''': when maps are simple and clear, they can be used to effectively make points about certain areas. For example, a map showing the building site for a new hospital could show its close location to key neighborhoods, or a map could show the differences in distribution of AIDS victims in North American and African countries.
* '''Cons''': inclusion of too much detail on a map can cause the audience to lose focus on the key point being made. Also, if the map is disproportional or unrealistic, it may prove ineffective for the point being made.

'''Tables'''
* Tables are columns and rows that organize words, symbols, and/or data.
* '''Pros''': Good tables are easy to understand. They are a good way to compare facts and to gain a better overall understanding of the topic being discussed. For example, a table is a good choice to use when comparing the amount of rainfall in 3 counties each month.
* '''Cons''': Tables are not very interesting or pleasing to the eye.  They can be overwhelming if too much information is in a small space or the information is not organized in a convenient way. A table is not a good choice to use if the person viewing it has to take a lot of time to be able to understand it. Tables can be visual distractions if it is hard to read because the font is too small or the writing is too close together.  It can also be a visual distraction if the table is not drawn evenly.

'''Photographs'''
* '''Pros''': Photographs are good tools to make or emphasize a point or to explain a topic. For example, when explaining the shanty-towns in a Third World country it would be beneficial to show a picture of one so the reader can have a better understanding of how those people live. A photograph is also good to use when the actual object cannot be viewed.  For example, in a health class learning about cocaine, the teacher cannot bring in cocaine to show the class because that would be illegal, but the teacher could show a picture of cocaine to the class. Using local photos can also help emphasize how your topic is important in the audience's area.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Presenting Effective Presentations with Visual Aids|url=http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/traintec.html|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]]|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cons''': If the photograph is too small it just becomes a distraction. Enlarging photographs can be expensive if not using a power point or other viewing device.

'''Drawings or diagrams'''
* '''Pros''': Drawings or diagrams can be used when photographs do not show exactly what the speaker wants to show or explain. It could also be used when a photograph is too detailed. For example, a drawing or diagram of the circulatory system throughout the body is a lot more effective than a picture of a cadaver showing the circulatory system.
* '''Cons''':If not drawn correctly a drawing can look sloppy and be ineffective.  This type of drawing will appear unprofessional.

===Visual aids media: simple to advanced===
* '''Chalkboard or whiteboard'''
Chalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are unavailable.  They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=J. Dan|title=In the company of others : an introduction to communication|year=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533630-6|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid.   Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom.  Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Poster board'''
A poster is a very simple and easy visual aid.  Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional.  Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over.  The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Handouts'''
Handouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over.  This can help the person better remember what was discussed.  Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting.  Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience’s attention.  The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it.&lt;ref name=maui&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumu|first=Ka|title=Using Visual Aids Effectively|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/mauispeech/html/visual_aids.html|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Maui College]] Speech Department|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Video excerpts'''
A video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech.  There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture.  First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk.  Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting.  The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Projection equipment'''
There are several types of projectors.  These include slide projectors, PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, and computer projectors.  Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used.  PowerPoint presentations are very popular and are used often.  Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use.  In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen.  This takes time and costs money.  Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors.  When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen.  Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Computer-assisted presentations'''
PowerPoint presentations can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track.  A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together.  There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Social media'''
Social media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size.

The '''Wilbour Papyrus''' is a [[papyrus]] purchased by the New York journalist [[Charles Edwin Wilbour]] from a farmer when he visited the island of [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]] in 1893. There he purchased seventeen papyri from a local farmer.  He did not realize the importance of his find and when he died in a hotel in Paris his belongings, including the papyri (among these the [[Brooklyn Papyrus]] and the [[Elephantine Papyri]]), were put in storage by the hotel and not returned to his family for nearly half a century. At the request of his widow, they were donated to the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

The Wilbour Papyrus is to ancient Egypt what the census bureau is to us today. It was translated by Alan Gardiner. Most of the first section of the papyrus was lost due to decomposition. The better preserved information begins in section two which starts off with “year 4, [second month of the Inundation-season], day 15 to day 20, making six days, assessment made by (unknown)”. The name of the ruling king at the time was never mentioned but it is believed it was written during the time of Ramesses V. The papyrus is a document that is broken up into two parts, text A and text B. It is roughly 33&amp;nbsp;ft in length, contains 127 columns and over 5,200 lines. It has information on about 95 miles of land and is written by more than one scribe.

Although it is not the largest papyrus ever found, it is the largest in its class. It also contains more information than other papyri which succeed it in size. It is the largest non-funerary papyrus known to ancient Egypt. Even though at this point there has been no evidence of one like it, it is hard to believe the ancient Egyptians did not keep similar documentation. It is possible there was several like this one but was not preserved over the years. This particular papyrus has various information on the late Ramsessid period. This information includes but is not limited to taxation, information about late Ramessid administrative practices, temple economy, population, occupations and land donated to deities.	

There are many theories as to what the original purpose of the papyrus was. Some believe the papyrus could be a copy of the “chief taxing master” which was responsible for temple finance. Others speculate it was the “''jpw''-register" of Amun. No matter what the original purpose was, it is an extremely informative document that gives us an unusual amount of insight on the government during the time of ancient Egypt.

'''"Occupations and Landowners"'''

According to the papyrus the most common occupations encountered were priests, military men, “ladies,” herdsmen, stable-masters, farmers, and scribes. Surprisingly enough the papyrus also lists a good amount of foreigners in its population. It mostly lists Libyans and Near Easterners, it is possible they were foreign mercenaries who had descendants who settled on farmland in which they obtained for serving in the military. In some cases we see if the person who owned the land had deceased. It would then say the land is being cultivated by the sons or daughters.

'''"Agriculture"'''

Even though the papyrus gives us specific information, there is still room for interpretation. The papyrus breaks the land up into four different parts. These parts are known as ''m-drt, ihwty, rowdy, rmnyt''. One word you see continuously debated is the translation of  ''“ihwty”.'' There is a few different thoughts as to what “''ihwty''” actually translates to. Many believe it means “tenant farmer”. Other thoughts of the meaning are “cultivator” or “field laborer”.

''M-drt'' is translated to “split small holder”. A split small holder is a plot of land that is owned by more than one cultivator or tenant farmer. These plots are generally owned by the lower or middle class. As Sally Katary wrote in “Labour on smallholdings in the New Kingdom”, there are roughly 2,245 cultivated plots. Sally tries to break down 93 plots that are mentioned as being ''m-drt''. She bases her number of cultivators needed for each plot off of the size of the plot. She also uses information on how many split plots are owned by the smallholder and the location of the multiple plots owned by the smallholder. By going off of the towns mentioned in both text A and B in the papyrus, we are able to identify locations of the plots. Although we have a vague idea of the locations they have not been able to be completely identified. However, it is possible these locations reveal the hierarchies of the towns and villages exposing the agricultural organization. It is also believed the plots lay across the flood plain, from the Nile banks to the desert edge and along the Bahr Yusuf.

'''"Taxation"'''

	In some cases, the private processor would pay a fixed rate. It is not certain if this rate was paid as a tax fee or as a management fee to the temple. It is possible it went to the temple if the plot was situated on temple land. Taxes were also taken in the form of goods. The larger lots that were worked by field workers were also supervised and paid taxes by turning over 30 percent of their harvest.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The study of '''women and religion''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. Most religions elevate the status of men over women, have stricter sanctions against women, and require them to be submissive. While there has been progress towards equality, religions overall still lag the rest of society in addressing gender issues. There are fundamentalists within every religion who actively resist change. There is often a dualism within religion which exalts women on the one hand, while demanding more rigorous displays of devotion on the other. This leads some feminists to see religion as the last barrier for female emancipation.

[[File:Venerabletzuchuang-cropped.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A high-ranking [[Bhikkhuni]] in the [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist tradition]] during an alms round.]]
[https://file.scirp.org/pdf/OALibJ_2017042616323563.pdf Women in Buddhism] is a topic that can be approached from varied perspectives including those of theology, history, anthropology and feminism. Topical interests include the theological status of women, the treatment of women in Buddhist societies at home and in public, the history of women in Buddhism, and a comparison of the experiences of women across different forms of Buddhism. As in other religions, the experiences of Buddhist women have varied considerably.

[[Buddhism]] can be considered to be revolutionary within the social and political realms of ancient India in regards to the role of women. During this time period, members of the highest Hindu caste, called [[Brahmin]]s, did not allow women to have any involvement with religious rites or sacred texts of the Vedas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy|last=Halkias|first=Georgios|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=9781118324004|location=UK|pages=494|doi = 10.1002/9781118324004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were further oppressed by the sacred texts of Hindu code, called the Laws of Manu, which stated that “By a girl, by a young woman, or even an aged one, nothing must be done independently, even in her own house. In childhood a female must be subject to her own father, in youth to her husband, when her lord is dead to her sons; a woman must never be independent” (V, 147-46, 155).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu.htm|title=Laws of Manu|last=Buhler|first=George|date=|website=Internet Sacred Texts Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism can be attributed as revolutionary due to the fact that [[Gautama Buddha]] admitted women into the monastic order, during a time when monastic communities were dominated by males in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirimanne|first=Chand|date=November 2016|title=Buddhism and Women - Dhamma has no Gender|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1923&amp;context=jiws|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|volume=18|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, one of the main schools of tradition that originated from the early development of Buddhism, called [[Theravāda Buddhism]], expresses the assumption that “all men and women, regardless of their caste, origins, or status, have equal spiritual worth.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because Buddhism can be described as a religious and philosophical ideology that does not have an explicit “Creator” there is no implied “sacredness” in relation to one’s human form, which means that the practice itself is not bound to the ideas of gender, reproduction, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last=Gross|first=Rita|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is argued that Buddhist traditions still have underlying issues pertaining to gender roles. While Buddhist ideologies may be considered a revolutionary step forward in the [https://journal.fi/scripta/article/view/67383/27680 status of women], many still consider the tradition to be subject to the social and political context of undermining gender issues during its upbringing, and even up to this day. The progression of gender issues, especially between gender and authority, can be seen during the time period of [[Hinayana Buddhism]], when the Buddhist order underwent major reforms of splitting into about 20 different schools. During this time Buddhist narratives and beliefs arose limiting the status of women’s roles within the Buddhist communities, asserting that women could not reach enlightenment, or [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuichi|first=Kajiyama|date=1982|title=Women in Buddhism|jstor=44361658|journal=The Eastern Buddhist|volume=15|issue=2|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that women would not attain positions of leadership because of the fact that they could not reach enlightenment, unless they “gain good [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and are reborn as men beforehand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/forum/can-women-become-leaders-in-the-buddhist-tradition|title=Can Women Become Leaders in the Buddhist Tradition?|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Khandro Rinpoche]], a female lama in Tibetan Buddhism, shows a more optimistic view in regards to women in Buddhism:&lt;blockquote&gt;When there is a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as something new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, this is not the case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Blossoms of the Dharma: Living as a Buddhist Nun|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J6Ci86jyYq4C|publisher = North Atlantic Books|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 9781556433252|language = en|first = Thubten|last = Chodron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a YouTube interview on why there are so few female teachers in the Buddhist communities, Rinpoche goes on to say that: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is because of a lack of education. It was a very patriarchal society back in the East. Wherever Buddhism grew, these societies were very patriarchal. It limits the opportunity women have to study and be independent – and you have study and be independent to manifest any kind of realization or understanding…fortunately, that seems to be changing. I really think that opportunities for education have now really increased for women – there becoming very competitive and learned, and things are going to change.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Study Buddhism|title=Khandro Rinpoche – Why Are There So Few Female Teachers?|date=2017-11-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEG5OrINvNM|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Rinpoche states that while the underlying nature of the [[patriarchal system]] that still exists today creates more obstacles and limitations for women in Buddhism, she believes that there is a changing dynamic and optimistic future for women within the Buddhist community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Further|Women in Christianity}}
Some Christians believe Christianity has set a mold for women to adhere to and is one that limits a woman’s freedom in the church. According to the Christian Bible, wives are expected to be submissive in many ways. They are asked not only to be submissive to their husbands, but to the church, their community, and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openbible.info/topics/virtuous_woman|title=What Does the Bible Say About Virtuous Woman?|website=www.openbible.info|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "At the head of every household is a man; at the head of a man is Christ; and the head of every women is a man; and the head of Christ is God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11:3&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Corinthians 11:3 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives are seen as second in the family household, only to that of their husbands. This suggests that men are first hand in Christianity and adds to issue of equal rights for women in the religion.

As according to scripture in Genesis, “the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet (fit or suitable) for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2:18&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 2:18 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlanta.clclutheran.org/bibleclass/thechristianwoman.html|title=The Christian Woman- - the role of women in the home, church and society|website=atlanta.clclutheran.org|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage suggests that women are to play a supportive role to men and is supported in further passages from Christian Scripture. For example, in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A18-19&amp;version=NIV Colossians] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A1-7&amp;version=NIV Peter], the specific passages call for women to submit to their husbands and to stay silent in their shadow. Lastly, in terms of how women are suppressed by scripture, the specific passage in Titus calls for a woman to not teach or preach in public assembly for that would constitute authority of a man.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Leadership roles in the organized churches and sects of Christianity are often restricted to males. In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and also in [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses.

Although Christianity professes equality for all and says women and men were created equal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3:28&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Galatians 3:28 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown throughout history women have been subject to the patriarchy that is embedded in the religion. “In the midst of the Greek, Roman, and Jewish cultures, which viewed women almost on the level of possessions, Jesus showed love and respect for women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/articles/A168/gods-high-call-for-women|title=God's High Call for Women|website=Grace to You|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expressed in the preceding quote, Jesus Christ professed equality and Christianity does express and celebrate equality. It is the patriarchy of society that has influenced Christianity and put men in positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crossway.org/articles/does-the-bible-reflect-a-patriarchal-bias/|title=Does the Bible Reflect a Patriarchal Bias?|website=www.crossway.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though women have played a vital role in the church, as expressed by the Acts and many others, none have ever been allowed a position of leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28:1-10&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 28:1-10 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16:13-15&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 16:13-15 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women such as Mary Magdalene, who played a major role in support Jesus’ and the ministry, show just how important women have been to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-mary-magdalene-119565482/|title=Who Was Mary Magdalene?|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apostle Paul is a great example in showing this as he worked, “side by side with them for the furtherance of the gospel,”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracechurch.org/about/distinctives/role-of-women|title=The Role of Women|website=www.gracechurch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but never appointed any women in roles of leadership or power. Women in Christianity can be roughly summarized in the following quote: “Although women are spiritual equals with men and the ministry of women is essential to the body of Christ, women are excluded from leadership over men in the church.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

However some Christians disagree with the idea that women should not have leadership positions, popular female preachers like [[Joyce Meyer]], [[Paula White]] and [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] have had or have leadership roles in Church. It is mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] that women such as [[Deborah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JDG.4.4 |title=Judges 4:4 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huldah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2KI.22.14 |title=2 Kings 22:14 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were Prophets. In the [[New Testament]] Philip was said to have four daughters who prophesied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ACT.21.8-9 |title=Acts 21:8-9 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Women in Hinduism}}
In Hinduism, women are displayed as equal or even greater than men, for instance Kali Ma (Dark Mother) "is the Hindu goddess of creation, preservation, and goddess of destruction" her power symbolized the origin of all creation's life, as well as the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themystica.com/kali-ma/|title=Kali Ma {{!}} Hindu Goddess|date=2018-02-04|work=The Mystica|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her control over life and death, Kali was seen as a goddess that should be loved as well as feared. Another important female figure is Shakti, a goddess that is embodied as the energy of the universe, "often manifested to destroy demonic forces and restore balance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chopra.com/article/shakti-universal-force|title=Shakti: A Universal Force|date=2016-05-01|work=The Chopra Center|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Shakti is a universal force, she is embodied by all the gods in Hinduism and is worshiped as the "mother goddess".

While Hinduism illustrates women as important figures that play an important role in understanding how the world works, women in Hindu society have been overlooked and their importance has been diminished throughout time due to outside forces that cause "girls being made to feel lesser and not as important as boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/whitehindu/2014/06/the-truth-about-women-and-hinduism/|title=The Truth About Women and Hinduism|last=Hindu|first=The White|date=2014-06-05|work=The White Hindu|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes created a shift in power between men and women to the point where, "a Hindu woman was preordained to be ruled by the male and was subjected to all kinds of atrocities for these were the standards of being an ideal Hindu woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basharat|first=Tahira|date=July–December 2009|title=The Contemporary Hindu Women of India: An Overview|url=http://results.pu.edu.pk/images/journal/csas/PDF/5-Dr.%20Tahira.pdf|journal=A Research Journal of South Asian Studies|volume=24|pages=244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this change in perception, Hinduism is now seen as a Partiarchal religion that teaches sexism and inequality, when in actuality it is the people in Hindu society's perception that is sexist rather than the religion itself. However, this view of women being treated as property is slowing beginning to change, as Hindu societies are pushing for more equality and a change in the perception of women.

== Islam ==
[[File:Virgin Mary and Jesus (old Persian miniature).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Mary in Islam|Mary]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] in a [[Persian miniature]]]]
{{Further|Women in Islam|Houri}}

[[Islam]] is a monotheistic religion that was founded in the early seventh century by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The notion of a good life for a Muslim person is defined in Islam’s sacred text, the [[Quran]], as well as the [[Hadith]] which are the direct teachings of [[Muhammad]]. Although these sources covered a lot, there were still some situations that were left to interpretation. Thus, Islamic scholars formed a consensus around a set of secondary sources, the most notable being the ijma, qiyas, ijtihad and fatwas. It is important to recognize that the Quran is not a static source with a fixed meaning but a dynamic, versatile one.&lt;ref&gt;Motahari, Ayatollah Morteza. "Jurisprudence and its principles." New York: Tahrike Tarsile Quran (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Quran emphasizes the equal treatment of all Islamic people, throughout history, the patriarchy has continued to oppress Muslim women since the religion was founded. Although the introduction of Islamic principles was a step in the right direction, men kept the dominant position and women were required to be obedient to their husbands. This was less due to the teachings of the religion but more so due to the mindsets of the era. Before Islam became so widespread, people of the Middle East lived in households in which women were seen as the property of their husbands and were only meant to perform household tasks, ultimately dehumanizing them.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Women." In ''The Islamic World: Past and Present''. Ed. John L. Esposito. ''Oxford Islamic Studies Online''. Apr 11, 2018. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e370&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of Islam also gave rise to the humanization of women and the recognition of women’s rights by placing men and women as equals in their ability to carry out the wishes of Allah and the teachings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jane I. "Women in Islam: Equity, Equality, and the Search for the Natural Order." Journal of the American Academy of Religion, vol. 47, no. 4, Dec. 1979, pp. 517-537. EBSCOhost, electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0000775406&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the introduction of Islamic principles was a step in the right direction, men kept the dominant position and women were required to be obedient to their husbands. This was mostly due to the cultural norms and was seen a way of life by the local community.  The three main things which [[sharia]] law introduced were a women’s rights to marriage, inheritance, and divorce. It also limited the oppressive privileges of men by placing restrictions on polygamy by limiting marriage to a maximum of four women only if they are taken care of equally and properly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Khel, Muhammad Nazeer Kaka. "THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN ISLAM."&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims must observe the five pillars of Islam: praying five times a day, fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]], making a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], donating to charity, accepting Allah as the only God and Muhammad as the messenger of God. Women have restrictions on public prayer and are either banned from mosques or have separate private spaces. On top of that they cannot pray during menstruation and if they are pregnant or in labor during the month of Ramadan, they must make up these fasting days.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These restrictions and the negative impact of veiling which was otherwise seen as a respectable act yielded in the seclusion of woman from mosques and other Islamic educational centers. This drove a wedge in their advancement and forced them into a dependency of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Due to their isolation, it became the responsibility of the [[ummah]], or Muslim community, to pass down the customs and traditions that mold a Muslim women's life. This guidance, sharia, and Islamic scripture outlined the structure for her education, employment opportunities, rights to inheritance, dress, public appearance, domestic 'duties', age of marriage, freedom to consent to marriage, marriage contract, mahr, permissibility of birth control, divorce, sex outside or before marriage, her ability to receive justice in case of sex crimes, property rights independent of her husband, and when ''salat'' (prayers) are mandatory for her.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, S. &amp; Kellison, R. B. "At the Intersection of Scripture and Law: Qur'an 4:34 and Violence against Women." Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, vol. 26 no. 2, 2010, pp. 11-36.

== Judaism ==
{{Further|Women in Judaism}}
The role of women in Judaism is determined by the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Oral Law (the corpus of rabbinic literature), by custom, and by non-religious cultural factors. Although the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature mention various female role models, religious law treats women differently in various circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Judaism 101: The Role of Women|url = http://www.jewfaq.org/women.htm|website = www.jewfaq.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout historical Jewish texts, all people were seen equal under the highest level: God.  The Hebrew bible states that “man” was made both “male and female”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genesis.  The Hebrew Bible|publisher=Cassell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dual gender, but was later separated into male and female.  In Judaism, God has never been exclusively viewed as male or masculine, but rather, he obtains both masculine and feminine qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coogan|first1=Michael|title=God and sex: What the Bible really says|date=2011|publisher=Twelve|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scriptures and ancient texts refer God as “him” because there is no neutral gender in the Hebrew language.  
  
Because it is an essential building block of marriage, family is strongly emphasized in Judaism.  Gender has a bearing on familial lines: in traditional Judaism, Jewishness is passed down through the mother, although the father's name is used to describe sons and daughters in the Torah, e.g., "Dinah, daughter of Jacob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Women|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/women.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Responsibilities were not taken lightly with regards to the family.  The wife and mother in Hewbrew, Jewish language, is called "akeret habayit," which in literal English translation means "mainstay." A Jewish household is expected to live up to the Torah, in which the aketet habayit, or woman of the house, tends to the family and household duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1802936/jewish/Woman-in-Judaism.htm|title=What is the Role of the Woman in Judaism?|website=www.chabad.org|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were highly regarded within the Jewish community because they were capable of a great degree of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|"binah"]] (institution, understanding, intelligence).  The term, “women of valor,” describes the ideal characteristics of a Jewish woman.  Traditionally, she is one who devoted all her energies towards the “physical and spiritual well-being of her family” because she had the capabilities to do so.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wenger|first1=Beth|title=Jewish Women and Voluntarism: Beyond the Myth of Enablers|journal=American Jewish History|volume=79|issue=1|pages=16–36|jstor=23884567|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her continuous devotion allowed her husband and children to flourish; her personal reward being their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Krieger|first1=Aliza|title=The Role of Judaism in Family Relationships|journal=Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development|volume=38|issue=3|pages=154–165|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1912.2010.tb00123.x|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, that role has reshaped itself throughout time.  The “women of valor’s” effect expanded beyond the household and into the community.  Volunteer work allowed women to acquire a sense of self-hood while sharpening leadership and organizational skills.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;  While it may seem that women only had influence in smaller communities, Jewish women eventually established enough authority to emerge as public figures.  In 1972, Sally Priesand, became the first female rabbi that was publicly ordained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Rabbis|url=https://jwa.org/rabbis|website=Jewish Women's Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were able to lead worship services and read from the Torah on par with men, if not even better because they had an alternative perspective of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=David|title=Women Rabbis: A Novel Idea|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=21865370&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in traditional Judaism has been grossly misrepresented and misunderstood. The position of women is not nearly as lowly as many modern people think; in fact, the position of women in [[halakhah]] (Jewish Law) that dates back to the biblical period is in many ways better than the position of women under American civil law as recently as a century ago.

== Sikhism ==
[[File:Preparing langar.jpg|thumb|Volunteers preparing [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] at the [[Golden Temple]] in [[Amritsar]], [[India]].]]
{{Further|Women in Sikhism}}
According to [[Sikhism]], men and women are two sides of the same coin of the human. There is a system of inter-relation and inter-dependence where man takes birth from woman, and woman is born of a man's seed. According to Sikhism a man can not feel secure and complete during his life without a woman, and a man's success is related to the love and support of the woman who shares her life with him, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sri Guru Granth Sahib – A brief history {{!}}  Islam Ahmadiyya|url = https://www.alislam.org/egazette/updates/sri-guru-granth-sahib-a-brief-history/|website = www.alislam.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of Sikhism, [[Guru Nanak]], reportedly said in 1499 that "It is a woman who keeps the race going" and that we should not "consider woman cursed and condemned, when from woman are born leaders and rulers."

Sikhs have had an obligation to treat women as equals, and gender discrimination in Sikh society has not been allowed. However, gender equality has been difficult to achieve.

At the time of the Gurus women were considered very low in society. Both Hindus and Muslims regarded women as inferior and a man's property. Women were treated as mere property whose only value was as a servant or for entertainment. They were considered seducers and distractions from man's spiritual path. Men were allowed polygamy but widows were not allowed to remarry but encouraged to burn themselves on their husbands funeral pyre (sati). Child marriage and female infanticide were prevalent and purdah (veils) were popular for women. Women were also not allowed to inherit any property. Many Hindu women were captured and sold as slaves in foreign Islamic countries.

[[Jainism]] is an ancient Indian religion founded around the sixth century BCE.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/27109180|title=Religion and women|last=Arvind.|first=Sharma,|date=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791416895|oclc=27109180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism is inclusive of women, as one of the cornerstones of the religion is the “fourfold [[Sangha (Jainism)|sangha]]” which describes the Jainism community, which is made up of monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Women in musicology''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women professors, scholars and researchers]] in [[postsecondary education]] [[musicology]] departments at [[postsecondary education]] institutions, including [[university|universities]], [[college]]s and [[Music conservatory|music conservatories]]. Traditionally, the vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She  has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

'''Zemiology''' is the study of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ζημία ''zēmía'', meaning "[[harm]]".&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004"&gt;Hillyard, P. (with C. Pantazis, S. Tombs and D. Gordon) (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
It originated as a [[critique]] of [[criminology]] and the notion of [[crime]]. In contrast with "individual-based harms" such as [[theft]], the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by [[nation state]]s and [[Corporation|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwendinger, H. and Schwendinger, J. (1970) "Defenders of order or guardians of human rights" ''Issues in Criminology''&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxists]] and [[Feminism|feminists]] who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely [[Criminalization|criminalised]] such as [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] misselling, [[poverty]] and [[unemployment]].&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Issue of Crime, Law and Social Change (2007, vol 48: 1-2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zemiological critique of criminology and crime==
Hillyard and Tombs outline a number of criticisms of criminology and crime:&lt;ref&gt;see chap 2 (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Crime has no [[Ontology|ontological]] reality" – Crime is a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] and is based on social judgements. However, there are no central properties that pertain to the notion of crime; therefore, what is a crime will vary across time and space.
* "Criminology perpetuates the myth of crime" – Criminology is based upon the notion of crime, which fails to adequately address the social construction of the concept. Therefore, criminology's continued use of the notion within its frame of analysis perpetuates the myth that crimes are distinct acts that may be understood as separate social phenomena.
* "Crime consists of many petty events" – In a large proportion of reported crimes, the harms endured by victims, if there are any, are minimal.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2015}} Hence Hillyard and Tombs argue that "the definitions of crime in the [[criminal law]] do not reflect the only or the most dangerous of antisocial behaviours."
* "Crime excludes many serious harms" – Many events and incidents which cause serious harm are either not part of the criminal law or, if they could be dealt with by it, are either ignored or handled without resort to it. The undue attention given to events which are defined as crimes distracts attention from more serious harm (such as [[pollution]] or poverty).
* {{Double single}}Crime control' is ineffective" – Hillyard and Tombs have argued that the methods and approach to crime control have patently failed. They believe the criminal justice system is unsuccessful in fulfilling its aims and in reforming criminal offenders. It appears that the criminal justice system sees there is only one solution to crime control, and that is a [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]; however, it is questionable whether this actually resolves certain crimes in society.
* {{Double single}}Crime' gives legitimacy to the expansion of crime control" – Since the early 1990s, governments have emphasised crime control as a key concern, and crime control has increased faster than any other area of public expenditure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Consequently, security firms have increasingly sought to provide services to the burgeoning penal state. It is argued that these private interests have played a key part in the expansion of prison, as means to deal with social problems.
* "Contrasting 'crimes{{Single double}} – The criminal law uses different tests to determine whether a crime has been committed. The principal test is the concept of ''[[mens rea]]'' – the guilty mind – which applies to the individual but not exclusively. However, these tests are not objective and often rely on subjective judgements about an individual's actions. ''Mens rea'' has to be judged by proxy, examining both a person's words and deeds. This becomes an even more complex task when applying the test an organisation, particularly as the harms caused by organisations result from the actions or inactions of a number of individuals and omission rather than intent. Therefore, harms caused by organisations are rarely criminalised.
* "Criminalisation and punishment inflict pain" – The criminal justice system has many stages which inflict pain in a discrete manner: defining, classifying, broadcasting, disposing and punishing the offender. Furthermore, these processes create wider social problems which bear no or little relationship to the initial crime and the original pain that was caused. For example, they may lead to loss of jobs, family problems or [[ostracism]].

==Harms of the criminal justice system==
Hillyard and Tombs argue that the criminal justice system fails to protect people from criminal harms whilst inflicting serious harms on those people who travel through the system. These harms often outweigh the harm caused by the original crime. However, current criminal justice policy within countries like the UK continues to champion the use of prison as a means to deal with social problems. In 2002, the UK prison population was 80,144. The population rate, per hundred thousand of national population, for England and Wales was 139. These figures are high compared to the rest of Europe in terms of overall numbers; however, looking at prison population rate, they are similar to many other countries in Europe. Italy, Spain, France, Romania and Belarus each had prison populations of around 50,000 in 2001–2002. Only Poland and the Ukraine had prison populations higher than that of the UK, at 82,173 and 198,885 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005045/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These rising prison numbers however do not necessarily reflect a rise in crime. Overall, since 1995 there has been a reduction in total crime. The [[British Crime Survey]] has shown that the overall crime experienced by households has declined by 42% which is the equivalent to eight million fewer crimes. More specifically, domestic burglary has fallen by 59%, vehicle theft has decreased by 61% and violent crimes have experienced a reduction of 41%. According to these figures it appears that the reason for the growth in the prison population is not due to a rise in crime.
In spite of the faith demonstrated by politicians in the criminal justice system, it would appear{{Says who|date=April 2015}} that the criminal justice system seems to fail in its own terms. The probability of a criminal re-offending is determined by external factors including having a stable family life, a home and a job. All of these are arguably weakened by a prison sentence. The [[Social Exclusion Task Force|Social Exclusion Unit]] has demonstrated that prison fails to rehabilitate on a dramatic scale with two thirds of prisoners re-offending within 2 years of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifechangeuk.com/PDF%5CSEU%20-%20Reducing%20re-offending%20by%20ex-prisoners.pdf www.lifechangeuk.com: reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a prison place costs £37,000 per annum.

=== Relation of welfare benefits to prison population ===

Concern has been expressed{{By whom|date=April 2015}} that the prison is being used as a mechanism to deal with social problems as spending on welfare benefits and services has decreased. Downes and Hansen argue that a country's welfare spending and prison population are inversely related, meaning that a country with high spending on welfare has a lower prison population and vice versa. Portugal, for example, has 147 prisoners per 100,000 people but spend only 18.2% of their GDP on welfare. This is quite a contrast to Scandinavian states, such as Sweden, whose prison population is 60 prisoners per 100,000 people as they spend 31% of GDP on welfare. During the 1990s the UK, whose spending on welfare is 20.8% GDP, saw an increase of 40% in the number of custodial sentences passed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/opus304.html|title=Welfare and punishment. The relationship between welfare spending and imprisonment|work=crimeandjustice.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is arguably reflected in the composition of the UK's prison population. For example, almost half of the prison population in Britain has been diagnosed with 3 or more mental disorders.&lt;ref name="revdoor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|title=Documents - Revolving Doors Agency|work=revolving-doors.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107032201/http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those prisoners diagnosed with a mental health problem: 50% of these prisoners are not registered with a GP; 42% of men with a psychotic disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 79% of men with a personality disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 46% have been arrested having never received any benefits despite their disorder; over a third are sleeping rough and over two thirds are not in education or training.&lt;ref name="revdoor"/&gt;

==Broadening perceptions of harm==
=== Physical harm ===

The zemiological or social harm approach attempts to broaden public and sociological focus to [[wikt:vicissitude#Noun|vicissitudes]] of daily life in capitalist society; some of these harms, they argue, are more harmful than those caused by crime. Approximately 1,000 people a year are murdered in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk: crime 0607 Summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324214809/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |date=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of events that cause large amounts of physical harm and even death, which are rarely considered crime or criminalised. In the UK there are around 40,000 serious road accidents in the UK every year. This is equivalent to a jumbo jet crashing every month. In 2002 3,431 people were killed on Britain’s roads and 35,976 seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series7/cars.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out - Car Crash|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 81,562 cases of food poisoning were reported and the majority of these cases are believed to have been contracted in food prepared outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2002/feb/campaign www.food.gov.uk campaign]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, The [[Labour Force Survey]] found that 228 people were killed while working due to a work-related incident and 2.2 million people with illnesses in the UK believed their condition was made worse by their past or current job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |title=www.hse.gov.uk |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110181600/http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |archive-date=2014-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing phenomenon affecting workers' health is stress. A report issued by the British [[Health and Safety Executive]] found that 16% of workers were working over 60 hours a week.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Similarly, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] found that 19% of men visited doctors for stress related problems, with that figure rising to 23% in men over 40. Also, the [[Trade Union Congress]] found 10% of work-based personal injury cases were stress-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazards.org/workedtodeath/dropdead.pdf www.hazards.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department of Health]] there were 3500 deaths occurring from the effects of [[Sulfur dioxide#Safety|sulphur dioxide]] and 8100 deaths were caused due to [[Particulate#Health effects|particulate matter]] in the air in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{cite web|url=http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm#results |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174942/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homeowners ===

Equally, the financial costs theft and burglary are outweighed when one considers wider financial harms. For example, thousands of homeowners have been sold [[endowment mortgage]]s without any likely means of repaying them. More than 3 million homeowners face the likelihood that their endowment policy, when it matures, will be worth too little to pay off the mortgage. 60% of endowment mortgages are not on track to cover the original debt and 39,000 complainants looking to receive approximately £126 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/oct/27/endowments.observercashsection|title=Endowed with a sense of fear|author=Helen Monks|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today{{When|date=April 2015}} in Britain 9.5 million people cannot afford adequate housing conditions, 8 million cannot afford one or more essential good, 7.5 million people do not have enough money to attend social activities and 4 million do not receive proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/poverty/pse/sum_find.htm|title=1999 PSE - Summary Findings|work=bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to social harms ==

Whilst the UK and other liberal democracies spend large resources on their respective criminal justice systems, other regulatory and policy responses remain less well funded considering the extent and the serious nature of the harms they seek to prevent. This is illustrated through the following case examples.

=== Regulating the minimum wage ===

The minimum wage was introduced in 1998 to combat the problem of in-work poverty and inequality. The act established for the first time in the UK a minimum hourly rate of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led [[Industrial Tribunal]] claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams ([[Inland Revenue]]). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’,&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34"&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34),&lt;/ref&gt; which include: enforcement order, penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The enforcement order requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.

&lt;ref&gt;Low Pay Commission http://www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/rep_a_p_index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated by the [[Low Pay Commission]] that 146,000–219,000 workers are not receiving the wage they are legally entitled too. It has been suggested that the reasons for relate to the limited resources available to the Inland Revenue Enforcement Teams.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34)&lt;/ref&gt; The Inland Revenue Enforcement Team consists of 16 compliance teams, each with 3 to 8 officers, based in fourteen towns and cities throughout the UK. In 1999 there were 115 Inspectors which meant that a workplace could expect to be inspected once every 30 years.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34" /&gt;

=== Policy responses to inequality ===

Inequality has grown in countries like the UK since the beginning of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is argued that this growth in inequality has had a series of deleterious and harmful effects. These include children’s life chances, mental health, physical health, crime and social well being.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009"&gt;Wilkinson RG, Pickett KE. (2009) ''The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better''. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; Using the example of physical, numerous studies have demonstrated that those from lower socio economic classes have lower life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009" /&gt; For instance a recent{{When|date=April 2015}} research study that investigated differences in health in the 678 electoral wards of the northern region of England found that death rates were four times as high in the poorest 10 per cent of wards as they were in the richest 10 per cent. In the 1980s more and more households fell into poverty and by the early 1990s one in three children lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008"&gt;Toynbee P &amp; Walker D (2008) Unjust rewards. London: Granta&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequality is a harm that is perceived{{By whom|date=April 2015}} as an inherent and largely unpreventable feature of our society. Yet a number of academics attribute the current levels of inequality in the UK to a series of policy decisions that have been made over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"&gt;Gordon, D. &amp;  Pantazis, C. (1997) Breadline Britain in the 1990s. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the growing levels of inequality are numerous. The poorest groups in society have seen their income and wealth affected by developments such as the decreasing value of benefits in real terms, the deregulation of labour markets etc., whilst the rich have seen their wealth grow primarily as a result of the changes made in the UK tax system since 1979.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"/&gt; In particular, the top rate of income tax was cut by the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] in the first post-1979 election budget from 83% to 60%. Then it was cut to 40%. Moreover, tax havens have increased and become common place which has enabled wealthy individuals and companies to avoid taxation regimes. In fact, tax consultants Grant Thornton estimated that the UK’s 54 billionaires paid income tax of only £14.7 million in 2006. At least 32 paid no income tax at all. In contrast, according to the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], £3.4 billion a year would lift enough families out of poverty to hit [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour’s]] pledge of halving child poverty by 2010.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article658376.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating environmental harm ===

It is estimated that 24,000 lives are prematurely ended due to the effects of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513065011/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/ |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these health consequences are estimated to cost the UK £29,000 per life year lost in "good" health, £15,000 per life year lost in "poor" health and £1,900–£2,000 per hospital admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|title=Defra UK-AIR - air pollution information for the UK|work=airquality.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218064758/http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|archive-date=18 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the harm caused by air pollution the UK has a poor record in responding to air pollution. The [[European Union#Environment|European Union]] is currently{{When|date=April 2015}} considering prosecuting the British government for breaching air pollution laws. Air pollution near in a number of locations has been recorded at twice the UN's [[World Health Organization]] maximum recommended level, which has consequently infringed EU air quality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/02/air-pollution-laws-britain-eu|title=UK faces court case over air pollution breaches|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Environment Agency, the UK's principal environmental regulator, has what some{{Who|date=April 2015}} may consider to be a poor record of prosecuting infringements of environmental standards. For example, there were 29,627 "substantiated" pollution incidents in 2003, of which 1337 were considered serious by the agency. However, in the same year the agency prosecuted 266 companies, 61 resulted in fines over £10,000. The average fine for companies was £8,412, down from £8,622 in 2002. There are approximately 20,000 incidents each year in the UK and around 250 prosecutions, which means there is a one in eighty chance of company being prosecuted for these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/|title=Environment Agency - GOV.UK|work=environment-agency.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating health and safety at work ===

Large numbers of people each year lose their lives due to injuries and diseases that result from their work. In 2007–08, 229 workers were killed at work, whilst 136,771 other injuries to employees were reported under [[Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations|RIDDOR]] and 299,000 reportable injuries occurred, according to the Labour Force Survey. In addition, 2.1 million people were suffering from an illness they believed was caused or made worse by their current or past work. It is believed that 2056 people died of [[asbestos]] related diseases contracted through their work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbestos.htm|title=Statistics - Asbestos related disease|work=hse.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these large scale harms, the principal regulatory in the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, has faced continuing cuts, most notably the 2006 £5.6m reduction in the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/commissionimpossible/safetychips.htm|title=HSE is broke - Hazards Magazine issue 96|work=hazards.org|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had major implications for the ability of the HSE to regulate workplaces with a decreasing numbers of regulatory contacts. A recent [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] report argued that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Around 85 per cent of major injuries reported to HSE are never investigated ... there is only so much that the 500 or so inspectors in HSE's Field Operations Division (FOD) can achieve. This means that very serious career-ending accidents go unpunished simply because there is no one to gather the evidence. The number of prosecutions is now half what it was in the early 1990s – this simply means that more employers are getting away with it, not that they are more compliant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003120740/https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm |date=October 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
