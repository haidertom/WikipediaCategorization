[[File:Airquotes.gif|thumbnail|right|The index and middle finger are lowered twice.]]

'''Air quotes''', also called '''finger quotes''', are virtual [[quotation marks]] formed in the air with one's fingers when speaking. This is typically done with hands held shoulder-width apart and at the eye level of the speaker, with the index and middle fingers on each hand flexing at the beginning and end of the phrase being quoted.&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/air-quotes.html |title=Air quotes |accessdate=18 November 2008 |last=Martin |first=Gary |work=The Phrase Finder| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081103020926/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/air-quotes.html| archivedate= 3 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air-quoted phrase is—in the most common usage—very short, at most a few words.  Air quotes are often used to express [[satire]], [[sarcasm]], [[irony]] or [[euphemism]], among others, and are analogous to [[scare quotes]] in print.

Use of similar gestures has been recorded as early as 1927&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder" /&gt;, and Glenda Farrell used air quotes in a 1937 screwball comedy, "Breakfast for Two." (Much earlier, in 1889, Lewis Carroll described similar usages -- air brackets and an air question mark -- in his last novel, &lt;ref&gt;''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', vol.I, ch.17: [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/620/620-0.txt «he marked the parenthesis, in the air, with his finger» and «what can be simpler than just to make a “?” in the air with your finger?»].&lt;/ref&gt;). The term "air quotes" first appeared in a 1989 [[Spy (magazine)|''Spy'' magazine]] article by [[Paul Rudnick]] and [[Kurt Andersen]], who state it became a common gesture around 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudnick|first1=Paul|title=The Irony Epidemic|work=Spy Magazine|date=March 1989|page=93-98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gesture was used routinely in the TV show ''[[Celebrity Charades]]'' (1979) as the standard signal for a quote or phrase.
In the episode "Nurse's Wild" of TV show ''[[Emergency!]]'' (1972), the character Roy DeSoto uses air quotes at Rampart Hospital base station.

The trend became very popular in the 1990s, attributed by many to comedian [[Steve Martin]], who often used them with exaggerated emphasis in his stand-up shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Additionally, in the blockbuster ''[[Austin Powers (series)|Austin Powers]]'' film series, [[Dr. Evil]] makes exaggerated use of air quotes when explaining matters to his henchmen, particularly while using real phrases he erroneously believes himself to have coined such as "[[laser]]" and "[[Death Star]]".

In the [[HBO]] special [[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|''Back in Town'']] from 1996, the stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] satirized the use of air quotes in the skit "Quote Marks in the Air" from the segment "Free-Floating Hostility".

{{Anthropology}}

The '''anthropology of development''' is a term applied to a body of [[Anthropology|anthropological]] work which views development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed, and implications for the approach typically adopted can be gleaned from a list questions posed by Gow (1996). These questions involve anthropologists asking why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail? 

This ''anthropology of development'' has been distinguished from ''[[development anthropology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gow, David D. (1996) Review: The Anthropology of Development: Discourse, Agency, and Culture Reviewed work: An Anthropological Critique of Development: The Growth of Ignorance by Mark Hobart and Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World by Arturo Escobar, ''Anthropological Quarterly'' Vol. 69, No. 3, Healing and the Body Politic: Dilemmas of Doctoring in Ethnographic Fieldwork, Jul., pp. 165-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Marc, and Angelique Haugerud. (2005). ''The anthropology of development and globalization: from classical political economy to contemporary neoliberalism''. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Development anthropology''' refers to the [[applied anthropology|application of anthropological]] perspectives to the [[multidisciplinary]] branch of [[development studies]]. It takes [[international development]] and international [[aid]] as primary objects. In this branch of [[anthropology]], the term development refers to the social action made by different agents ([[institutions]], [[business]], [[Organization|enterprise]], [[State (polity)|states]], independent [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s) who are trying to modify the economic, technical, political or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in impoverished, formerly colonized regions.

Development anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer Western projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most marginalized, and to eliminate poverty.  While some theorists distinguish between the 'anthropology of development' (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Marc, and Angelique Haugerud. (2005). ''The anthropology of development and globalization: from classical political economy to contemporary neoliberalism''. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Pub, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early approaches to development==

Some describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits [[modernization]] and an eradication of the indigenous [[culture]], but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work.  In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers, however they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based.  Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid.  The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself.  Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that:  systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that sustainable development requires at the very least more inclusion of the people who the project aims to target to be involved in the creation, management and decision making process in the project creation in order to improve development.

===Pre-WWII: Rhodes-Livingstone Institute===
The British government established the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] in 1937 to conduct social science research in British Central Africa. It was part of the colonial establishment, although its head, anthropologist [[Max Gluckman]], was a critic of colonial rule. Gluckman refused to describe colonialism as a simple case of "culture contact" since it was not a case of cultures mutually influencing each other, but of the forced incorporation of Africans into a foreign social, political and economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=Expectations of modernity: myths and meanings of urban life on the Zambian Copperbelt|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologists of the Institute were core members of what came to be known as the "[[Manchester school (anthropology)|Manchester school]]" of anthropology noted for looking at issues of social justice such as apartheid and class conflict.

===Culture of poverty===
{{main|Culture of poverty}}
The term "subculture of poverty" (later shortened to "culture of poverty") made its first prominent appearance in the ethnography ''Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty'' (1959) by anthropologist [[Oscar Lewis]]. Lewis struggled to render "the poor" as legitimate subjects whose lives were transformed by [[poverty]].  He argued that although the burdens of poverty were systemic and therefore imposed upon these members of society, they led to the formation of an autonomous subculture as children were socialized into behaviors and attitudes that perpetuated their inability to escape the underclass. In sociology and anthropology, the concept created a backlash, pushing scholars to abandon cultural justifications and negative descriptions of poverty, fearing such analysis may be read as "[[blaming-the-victim]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Bourgois, Phillipe| year=2001 | title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences | chapter=Culture of Poverty| editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Waveland Press | id= | url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modernization Theory and its critics ===
The most influential modernization theorist in development was [[Walt Rostow]], whose ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system|economic]] side of the modernization, and especially the factors needed for a country to reach [[Rostovian take-off model|"take-off"]] to self-sustaining growth. He argued that today's underdeveloped areas are in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that therefore the task in helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Rostow's unilineal evolutionist model hypothesized all societies would progress through the same stages to a modernity defined by the West. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:&lt;ref name=mth&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm W.W. Rostow, The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960), Chapter 2, "The Five Stages of Growth-A Summary," pp. 4-16&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223023302/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm |date=February 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Traditional society
# Preconditions for take-off
# Take-off
# Drive to maturity
# Age of High mass consumption

As should be clear from the subtitle of his book, Rostow sought to provide a capitalist rebuttal to the unilinear Marxist growth models being pursued in the newly independent communist regimes in the second and third world; an effort that would lead to the "[[Green Revolution|Green revolution]]" to combat the "[[Communist revolution|Red revolution]]".

====George Dalton and the substantivists====
George Dalton applied the substantivist economic ideas of [[Karl Polanyi]] to economic anthropology, and to development issues. The substantivist approach demonstrated the ways in which economic activities in non-market societies were [[Embeddedness|embedded]] in other, non-economic social institutions such as kinship, religion and political relations. He therefore critiqued the formalist economic modelling of Rostow. He was the author of "Growth without development: An economic survey of Liberia" (1966, with [[Robert W. Clower]]) and "Economic Anthropology and Development: Essays on Tribal and Peasant Economies" (1971).

====Dependency theory====
{{main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}

Dependency theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to [[modernization theory]]. It argues that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[World-system]]" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=166|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Immanuel Wallerstein's "world-systems theory" was the version of Dependency theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency theory.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"/&gt;

===='Women in development' (WID)====
{{main|Women in development|Gender and development}}
Women in development (WID) is an approach to development projects that emerged in the 1970s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. Later, the [[Gender and development]] (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation.{{sfn|Van Marle|2006|pp=125}} The WID school grew out of the pioneering work of [[Esther Boserup]]. Boserup's most notable book is ''The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure''.&lt;ref&gt;(Chicago, Aldine, 1965, {{ISBN|0-415-31298-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; This book presents a "dynamic analysis embracing all types of primitive agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boserup|first=Esther|title=The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure|year=1965|publisher=Aldine|location=Chicago|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Boserup, the WID theorists pointed out that the division of labour in agriculture is frequently gendered, and that in societies practicing [[shifting cultivation]], it is women who conduct most of the agricultural work. Development projects, however, were skewed towards men on the assumption they were "heads of households."

==Development discourse and the creation of the 'underdeveloped' world==

A major critique of development from anthropologists came from [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar's]] seminal book ''Encountering Development'', which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples. Arturo Escobar views [[international development]] as a means for the [[Western world|Occident]] to keep control over the resources of its former colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], 1995, ''Encountering Development'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; Escobar shows that between 1945 and 1960, while the former colonies were going through [[decolonization]], development plans helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old [[metropole]].  Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of WWII, and during the cold war,  when they were developed to 

1. stop the spread of Communism with the spread of capitalist markets; and 

2. create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad.   

Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like [[dependency theory]] or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations.   Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of [[dependency theory]] and follows a larger critique more recently posed by Foucault an other [[poststructuralists]].

==Governmentality: Development as 'anti-politics machine'==
{{main|The Anti-Politics Machine}}
[[File:Location Lesotho AU Africa.svg|thumbnail|Location of Lesotho in South Africa]]
At a critical juncture in the early nineteenth century the state began to connect itself to a series of groups “that in different ways had long tried to shape and administer the lives of individuals in pursuit of various goals” rather than simply extend the absolutist state’s repressive machinery of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Nikolas, Pat O'Malley, &amp; Mariana Valverde. (2006). ''Governmentality''. Annual Review of Law and Social Science Vol. 2: 83-104.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]]’s work on the prison, the clinic, and the asylum – on the development of “[[bio-power]]” – analyzed the plurality of governing agencies and authorities who developed programs, strategies, and technologies that were deployed to optimize the health, welfare and life of populations. He referred to this process with the neologism, “[[governmentality]]” (governmental rationality). One of the last of these new applied sciences was the "development apparatus", the post-world war extension of colonial rule after the independence of third world states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Escobar|first=Arturo|title=Encountering Development: the making and unmaking of the third world|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]] utilized the governmentality framework in "The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho" (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the first in many similar explorations. Ferguson sought to explore how "development discourse" works. That is, how do the language and practices used by development specialists influence the ways in which development is delivered, and what [[unintended consequences]] does it foster. He found that development projects which failed in their own terms could be redefined as "successes" on which new projects were to be modelled. The net effect of development, he found, was to "de-politicize" questions of resource allocation, and to strengthen bureaucratic power. In his analysis of a development project in Lesotho (South Africa) between 1978 and 1982, he examined the following discursive maneuvers. 

Ferguson points out that a critical part of the development process is the way in which the object of development is defined. In defining this object, it is severed from its historical and geographic context, and isolated as a "Less-Developed Country."  In the case of Lesotho, its history as a grain exporting region was ignored, as was its current role as a labour reserve for the South African mines. Not wanting to deal with the apartheid South African regime, development agencies isolated the "independent" Lesotho from the regional economy in which it was entrapped in their project rationales and reports. Artificially taken out of this larger capitalist context, Lesotho's economy was described as "isolated," "non-market" and "traditional" and thus a proper target for aid intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=25–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson underscores that these discourses are produced within institutional settings where they must provide a charter for governmental intervention. Any analysis which suggests the roots of poverty lie in areas outside the scope of government are quickly dismissed and discarded since they cannot provide a rationale for state action. And since the capitalist economy is one such area which has been ideologically set outside the scope of governmental action, the discursive creation of a deformed ‘native economy’ creates the required opening for that intervention.

Ferguson writes that it is not enough to note development's failures; even the project managers initially recognized it as a failure. If that was all Ferguson had done, his book would not have had the influence it did. Asking if development is a failure is asking the wrong question; it ignores the “instrument effects” of what the projects DO do. In other words, we should ask what NON-economic functions does development serve? His answer:
# It’s an “anti-politics machine”; it makes blatantly political decisions about the allocation of resources appear to be “technical solutions to technical problems”. Important questions such as the reallocation of land to a limited number (leaving them relatively wealthy, and others in poverty) are rephrased as a "necessity for the sustainable commercial management of livestock." A large proportion of men are deprived of their retirement savings.
# “Integrated development” served to strengthen the presence of a repressive government in an isolated and resistant area. Development projects are dependent upon local governments for implementation, and rarely challenge the nature of that government. The resources they supply frequently serve state needs more than local needs.
# It perpetuates the migrant labour system. The project neglected to look at Lesotho in the regional economy with South Africa. Lesotho was a labour reserve for Apartheid-era South African mines. The men of Lesotho were not farmers, but unemployed workers and retirees. Real commercial farming was never a possibility without large subsidies. The project thus served to preserve a pool of cheap labour for South Africa in a time when international sanctions against Apartheid were hitting its economy.

=== The Limits of Governmentality ===

===Ecogovernmentality===

{{main|Ecogovernmentality}}

Ecogovernmentality, (or Eco-governmentality), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of [[biopower]] and [[governmentality]] to the analysis of the regulation of [[Social relation|social interactions]] with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government. Following [[Michel Foucault]], writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents.  This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and [[internalization]] of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Malette, Sebastien. (2009) "Foucault for the next century: eco−governmentality" in Binkley, S. and Capetillo J. eds. A Foucault for the 21st Century: Governmentality, Biopolitics and Discipline in the New Millennium. Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work done by Arun Agrawal on local forest governance in India, is an example of this method of analysis.  He illustrates how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state.  This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes [[behavior]] in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agrawal|first=Arjun|title=Environmentality: Technologies of Government and the Making of Subjects|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural development: the "Green Revolution"==

The term "Green Revolution" was first used in 1968 by former [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) director [[William Gaud]], who noted the spread of the new technologies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent [[October Revolution|Red Revolution]] like that of the Soviets, nor is it a [[White Revolution]] like that of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]. I call it the Green Revolution."&lt;ref name="agbio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/topics/borlaug/borlaug-green.html |title=The Green Revolution: Accomplishments and Apprehensions |last1= Gaud |first1=William S. |date=8 March 1968 |publisher=AgBioWorld |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Archaeological science''', also known as '''archaeometry''', consists of the application of [[scientific technique]]s to the analysis of archaeological materials, to assist in dating the materials. It is related to [[Scientific methodology|methodologies]] of archaeology.  Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcos Martinón-Torres and David Killick|title=Archaeological Theories and Archaeological Sciences in "The Oxford Handbook of Archaeological Theory"|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level  theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Social science and archaeological enquiry|journal=Antiquity|date=4 April 2017|volume=91|issue=356|pages=520–528|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Natural Environment Research Council|Natural and Environmental Research Council]] provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | publisher = Antiquity
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in almost all cases of archeometric research, scientists from the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] assist in the scientific analysis of archeological artifacts. Universities that offer courses in archeometry offer these courses frequently as free choice for [[Archaeology|archeology]] students and these courses contain mainly a nonscientific overview over the possibilities that different scientific analyses offer to them.

== Types of archaeological science ==
Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M.S. (1991) Archaeological Science - past achievements and future prospects. ''Archaeometry'' '''31''' 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;
* physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating|relative]] [[chronology|chronologies]]
* [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] studies
* environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and [[pathology]] of people
* mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods)
* [[remote sensing|remote-sensing]] and [[geophysical survey|geophysical-survey]] techniques for buried features
* [[conservation sciences]], involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation

Techniques such as [[lithic analysis]], [[archaeometallurgy]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[zooarchaeology]] also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.

=== Dating techniques ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological [[stratum|strata]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Some of the most important [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] techniques include:
* [[radiocarbon dating]] — especially for dating organic materials
* [[dendrochronology]] — for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates
* [[thermoluminescence dating]] — for dating inorganic material (including ceramics)
* [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) — for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of [[quartz]] within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure [[potassium feldspar]]s, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications)
* [[electron spin resonance]], as used (for example) in dating teeth
* [[potassium-argon dating]] — for dating (for example) fossilized [[Hominidae|hominid]] remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated)

=== Artifact studies ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:
* [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF)
* [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS)
* [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA)
* [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM)
* [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS)

[[Lead]], [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope analysis]] can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study's subjects.

[[Provenance analysis]] has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of [[trade|exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of archaeometry ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the "second [[radiocarbon revolution]]" significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the "first radiocarbon revolution" from 1949.

== Locating Archaeological Sites ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites.  The use of [[remote sensing]] has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of [[aerial photography]] (including [[satellite imagery]] and [[Lidar]]) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]s often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Areni-1 shoe''' is a 5,500-year-old [[leather]] shoe that was found in 2008 in excellent condition in the [[Areni-1 cave]] located in the [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/06/09/worlds-oldest-leather-shoe-found-in-armenia-2/ |title=World's Oldest Leather Shoe Found—Stunningly Preserved |last=Dindar |first=Shereen |work=National Post |location=Canada  |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a one-piece leather-hide shoe, the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world known to contemporary researchers.&lt;!-- the range of accuracy in dating methods may have quite a large variable, depending upon what is stated for this dating, it could make little difference that a few hundred years difference is claimed and make the find merely contemporary with that found in Germany --&gt; The discovery was made by an international team led by  [[Boris Gasparyan]], an archaeologist from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]] (co-directors of the project are [[Ron Pinhasi]] from [[University College Cork]] in [[Ireland]], and [[Gregory Areshian]] from [[UCLA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient shoe steps out of cave and into limelight |author=Bruce Bower |newspaper=Science News |date=July 3, 2010 |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60099/title/Ancient_shoe_steps_out_of_cave_and_into_limelight |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
An Armenian post-graduate student, [[Diana Zardaryan]], discovered the leather shoe in the course of excavations by a team of archeologists from Armenia’s [[Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography]], Ireland and the United States.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-June12-2010"&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2069047.html ''Oldest Leather Shoe A ‘Dream’ Find For Armenian Scientist''], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), June 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The shoe was found upside down at the base of a shallow, rounded, and plastered pit that was {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|44|–|48|cm|abbr=on}} wide, beneath an overturned broken [[Chalcolithic]] ceramic bowl.&lt;ref name="First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010984 |title=First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands |work=PLOS One |first1=Ron |last1=Pinhasi |first2=Boris |last2=Gasparian |first3=Gregory |last3=Areshian |first4=Diana |last4=Zardaryan |first5=Alexia |last5=Smith |first6=Guy |last6=Bar-Oz |first7=Thomas |last7=Higham |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broken pot and goat horns also were found nearby. Excavations in the same area also found [[Areni-1 winery|the world's oldest wine-making site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12158341 |title='Oldest known wine-making facility' found in Armenia. |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |work=BBC |date=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research was funded by the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[Chitjian Foundation]], the [[Gfoeller Foundation]], the [[Steinmetz Family Foundation]], the [[Boochever Foundation]] and the [[Cotsen Institute of Archaeology]] at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/10/oldest-leather-shoe-steps_n_607264.html |title=Oldest Leather Shoe Steps Out After 5,500 Years |work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's findings were published on June 9, 2010, in the journal ''[[PLOS One]]''.

==Analysis==
The shoe was found in near-perfect condition due to the cool and dry conditions in the cave and a thick layer of sheep dung which acted as a solid seal. Large storage containers were found in the same cave, many of which held well-preserved wheat, barley, and [[apricot]]s, as well as other edible plants.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; The shoe contained grass and the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was because the grass was used as insulation to keep the foot warm, or used to preserve the shape of the shoe while not being worn. Lead archaeologist Ron Pinhasi could not determine whether the shoe belonged to a man or a woman. While small, approximately a woman's U.S. and Canada size 7, European size 37, or UK size 6, he stated that "the shoe could well have fitted a man from that era".&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; The [[shoe laces]] were preserved as well.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;

Major similarities exist between the manufacturing technique and style of one-piece leather-hide shoes discovered across Europe and the one reported from Areni-1 Cave, suggesting that shoes of this type were worn for millennia across a large and environmentally diverse geographic region.&lt;ref name="First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands"/&gt; According to Pinhasi, the Areni-1 shoe is similar to the Irish ''[[pampooties]]'', a shoe style worn in the [[Aran Islands]] up to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8KRXbqACR1CdoIW6YN9-GE4GjxQ | title = 5,500-year leather mocassin world's oldest shoe |agency=AFP | date = June 10, 2010 | accessdate = June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoes are very similar to the traditional shoes of the Balkans, still seen today in festivals, known as [[Opanci]] (''Opanke'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100609-worlds-oldest-leather-shoe-armenia-science/ National Geographic: ''World's Oldest Leather Shoe Found—Stunningly Preserved'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When the material was dated by the two radiocarbon laboratories in [[Oxford]] and California, it was established that the shoe dates back to 3,500&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;!-- the variable should be given as =/- xxx years --&gt;  This date is a few hundred years older than the date given for the leather shoe found on [[Ötzi the Iceman]], 400 years older than those found at [[Stonehenge]], and 1,000 years older than those found at the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/06/09/oldest-leather-shoe-archaeology/ |title=What's Older Than the Pyramids and Smells Worse Than a Mummy? |publisher=Fox News |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Areni-1_cave_entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the [[Areni-1 cave complex|Areni-1 cave]]]]

The '''Areni-1 winery''' is a 6100-year-old [[winery]] that was discovered in 2007 in the [[Areni-1 cave complex]] in the village of [[Areni]] in the [[Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]] by a team of Armenian and Irish archaeologists. The excavations were carried out by Boris Gasparyan of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]]  and Ron Pinhasi from [[University College Cork]] (Ireland), and were sponsored by the Gfoeller Foundation (USA) and University College Cork. In 2008 the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) also joined the project with Gregory Areshian as co-director of the Areni Project. Since then the excavations have been sponsored by UCLA and the [[National Geographic Society]] as well. The excavations of the winery were completed in 2010.

The winery consists of [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] [[Barrel|vats]], a [[wine press]], storage jars, pottery sherds, and is believed to be at least a thousand years older than the winery unearthed in [[Judea and Samaria]] in 1963, which is the second oldest currently known.&lt;ref name= "LAT"&gt;Maugh II, Thomas H.

The [[Areni-1 shoe]] was found in the same cave in 2008.

==Discovery==
Excavations at the Areni-1 site began in 2007 and continued until September 2010. Armenian, American and Irish archaeologists fully unearthed a large, well-preserved 2-foot (60 centimeter) deep vat, along with a 3.5-foot (one meter) long basin made of clay and covered with [[malvidin]].&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In addition to these discoveries grape seeds, remains of pressed grapes, prunes, walnuts, and desiccated vines were found. A number of drinking cups, found next to a set of ancient graves, were also excavated, suggesting that the site was used for funeral ceremonies and ritualistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Belluck, Pam. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/science/11wine.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science Cave Drops Hints to Earliest Glass of Red]." ''[[New York Times]]''. January 11, 2011.

Retrieved January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The cave was abandoned after its roof caved in, and the organic material was preserved thanks to sheep [[Feces|dung]], which prevented [[fungi]] from destroying the remains.&lt;ref name= "LAT"/&gt;

The team's full findings will be published in future.

[[File:Areni-1 cave panorama.jpg|900px|thumb|center|&lt;center&gt;Panorama of the Areni-1 site along the [[Arpa River]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Analysis==
The results of the biochemical analysis of the residues from the bottom of the wine-press and the storage jars carried out by Hans Barnard and his colleagues at UCLA were published in the ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Hans et al. "[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/science/YJASC_2685.pdf Chemical evidence for wine production around 4000 BCE in the Late Chalcolithic Near Eastern highlands]." ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', (2010), {{doi|10.1016/j.jas.2010.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical analysis and [[radiocarbon]] tests carried out by researchers at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and [[Oxford University]] have revealed the date of the Areni-1 winery to around 4100 BC and 4000 BC or the [[Copper Age|Late Chalcolithic Period]].&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt; According to Areshian, the vintners used their feet to press the wine in the clay basin, the juice of which would then drain into the vat, where it would remain to [[Fermentation (wine)|ferment]] until being stored in jars.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; The capacity of the vat has been estimated to be about 14–15 gallons (US or imperial??) {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

According to Areshian, the discovery of the winery has provided greater insight to the study of [[horticulture]]. Patrick E. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]], has likewise emphasized the importance of the discovery, describing it as "important and unique, because it indicates large-scale wine production, which would imply, I think, that the grape had already been domesticated."&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

The exact identity of the people who lived in the region at the time is not known, although some researchers have postulated that they may have belonged to the [[Kura-Araxes culture|Kura-Araxes]] people and added that they may have been very involved in trade.&lt;ref name= "LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

An '''art movement''' is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in [[modern art]], when each consecutive movement was considered as a new [[avant-garde]].

== Concept ==
According to theories associated with [[modernism]] and the concept of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]], art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe&amp;nbsp;— Passages'' – Critical Essay [[Artforum]],  Nov, 2003  by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; The period of time called "modern art" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called [[contemporary art]].

Also during the period of time referred to as "modern art" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an [[art manifesto]],&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i8066.html "Poetry of the Revolution.

In the [[visual arts]], many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay.

The term refers to tendencies in [[visual art]], novel ideas and [[architecture]], and sometimes [[literature]]. In [[music]] it is more common to speak about [[genre]]s and [[fashion|styles]] instead. See also [[cultural movement]], a term with a broader connotation.

As the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example [[cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|futurism]]), they are sometimes referred to as ''isms''.

'''Articulatory gestures''' are the actions necessary to enunciate language.   Examples of articulatory gestures are the hand movements necessary to enunciate sign language and the mouth movements of speech.   In [[semiotic]] terms, they are the physical embodiment (signifiers) of speech signs, which are gestural by nature (see below).

The definition of ''[[gesture]]'' varies greatly, but here it will be taken in its widest sense, namely, any meaningful action.   An intentional action is meaningful if it is not strictly utilitarian: for example, sending flowers to a friend is a gesture, because this action is performed not only for the purpose of moving flowers from one place to another, but also to express some sentiment or even a conventional message in the [[language of flowers]].  Use of the broadest definition of gesture (not restricted to hand movements) allows [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]]’s  “rapid fading” [[design features of language | design feature of human language]] to be accommodated as a type of sign in semiotic theory.

But if an articulatory gesture is to be considered a true gesture in the above sense, it must be meaningful.   Therefore, an articulatory gesture must be at least as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme.  A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or a sign language gesture.   

This definition differs from the practice, common among linguists,  of referring to phonemes (meaningless mouth movements) as articulatory gestures (see [[articulatory phonology]]).   In [[semiotics]], meaningless components of spoken gestures (written as individual letters), or meaningless components of sign language gestures (such as location of hand contact) are known as [[figurae]], the constituents of signs.    

It also differs from the tradition of considering speech sounds to be the signifiers of speech signs.  But this practice confuses signals with symbols.  Sound and light are analogue signals, whereas mouth and hand gestures are discrete symbolic entities.  A sound or light signal is subject to random noise, whereas the image of the gesture is subject to regular [[image distortion | distortion]], as when a signer’s hand is viewed from different angles. In speech, the sound of the contact of the tongue in the letter T can be distorted by surrounding mouth movements, as in the phrase “perfect memory”.  When pronounced at conversational speed, the sound of the tongue contact is completely obscured by surrounding consonants even though this T movement is fully carried out.

Articulatory gestures, when seen as the physical embodiment of speech and sign language symbols, provide a link between these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed.

'''Authoritarian literature''' &lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used by [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an [[authoritarian]] governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a [[patronage]] system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.

Fiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form [[allegory]].

==Examples==

Good examples of authoritarian literature include ''[[Beowulf]]'', ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and in [[English literature]] we see vestiges as late as [[Charles Dickens]]. While didacticism forms a significant component of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s, [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s and [[C. S. Lewis]]' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as ''[[Great Expectations]]'', we can "feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Works==

Authoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of [[Middle East]]ern countries ([[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and arguably [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iran]]'s literature excepted), and, until recently, [[Chinese literature]]. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.

The antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. [[Sunallah Ibrahim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Munif]]). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body

{{Chinese martial arts}}

'''Baguazhang''' ({{zh-cp|c=八卦掌|p=Bāguà Zhǎng}}) is one of the three main [[Chinese martial arts]] of the [[Wudang chuan|Wudang]] school, the other two being [[Taijiquan]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]]. It is more broadly grouped as an internal practice (or [[neijia|neijia quan]]). ''Bāguà zhǎng'' literally means "eight trigram palm," referring to the [[Bagua|trigrams]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'' (''Yijing''), one of the canons of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The creation of Baguazhang, as a formalised martial art, is attributed to [[Dong Haichuan]] (董海川), who is said to have learned from Taoist and Buddhist masters in the mountains of rural [[China]] during the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Yintao, Fei and Yuliang, Fei. “Classical Baguazhang Volume IV: Wudang Baguazhang.” Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chinese authorities do not accept the Buddhist origin, instead maintaining that those teachers were purely Taoist in origin, the evidence lying in Baguazhang's frequent reference to core concepts central to [[Taoism]], such as [[Yin and yang|Yin and Yang]] theory, [[I Ching]] and Taoism's most distinctive paradigm, the [[Bagua]] diagram.&lt;ref&gt;Liang Shou-yu, Yang Jwing-Ming, Wu Wen-Ching, “Baguazhang: Emei Baguazhang Theory and Applications” 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Allen, Tina Chunna Zhang, “The Whirling Circles of Ba Gua Zhang: The Art and Legends of the Eight Trigram Palm 2007” .&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution to Buddhist teachers came from the 2nd generation teachers, i.e. Dong Haichuan's students, some of whom were Buddhist. There is evidence to suggest a synthesis of several pre-existing martial arts taught and practised in the region in which Dong Haichuan lived, combined with Taoist circle walking. Through his work as a servant in the Imperial Palace he impressed the emperor with his graceful movements and fighting skill, and became an instructor and a bodyguard to the court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Green, Thomas A. "Martial Arts of the World" 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Dong Haichuan taught for many years in [[Beijing]], eventually earning patronage by the Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Jingru, Liu and Youqing, Ma. “Classical Baguazhang Volume II: Cheng Shi Baguazhang (Cheng Family Baguazhang).” Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous disciples of Dong Haichuan to become teachers were [[Yin Fu]] (尹福), [[Cheng Tinghua]] (程廷華), [[Ma Gui (martial artist)|Ma Gui]] (马贵), Song Changrong (宋長榮), Liu Fengchun (劉鳳春), Ma Weiqi (馬維棋), Liu Baozhen (劉寶珍), [[Liang Zhenpu]] (梁振蒲) and Liu Dekuan (劉德寛). Although they were all students of the same teacher, their methods of training and expressions of palm techniques differed.&lt;ref name="Lie, Zhang 1995" /&gt; The Cheng and Liu styles are said to specialize in "pushing" the palms, Yin style is known for "threading" the palms, Song's followers practice "Plum Flower" (梅花 ''[[Prunus mume|Mei]] Hua'') palm technique and Ma style palms are known as "hammers." Some of Dong Haichuan's students, including Cheng Tinghua, participated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In general, most bagua exponents today practice either the Yin (尹), Cheng (程), or Liang (梁) styles, although Fan (樊), Shi (史), Liu (劉), Fu (傅), and other styles also exist.  (The Liu style is a special case, in that it is rarely practiced alone, but as a complement to other styles). In addition, there are sub-styles of the above methods as well, such as the Sun (孫), Gao (高), and Jiang (姜) styles, which are sub-styles of Cheng method.

===Common aspects===
[[Image:250 Bagau016ChangChaoDong.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Internal martial arts|Internalist]] Zhang Zhaodong, also known as Zhang Zhankui.]]
The practice of circle walking, or "turning the circle", as it is sometimes called, is Baguazhang's characteristic method of stance and movement training. All forms of Baguazhang utilize circle walking as an integral part of training. Practitioners walk around the edge of the circle in various low stances, facing the center, and periodically change direction as they execute forms.&lt;ref&gt;Lie, Zhang. ''Classical Baguazhang Volume V: Yin Style Baguazhang.'' Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; For a beginner, the circle is six to twelve feet in diameter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Students first learn flexibility and proper body alignment through the basic exercises, then move on to more complex forms and internal power mechanics.  Although the internal aspects of Baguazhang are similar to those of Xingyiquan and Taijiquan, they are distinct in nature.

[[Image:Baguadao (八卦刀).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fu Chen Sung|Fu Zhensong]] with a large bagua saber.]]
Many distinctive styles of weapons are contained within Baguazhang; some use concealment, like the "scholar's pen" or a pair of knives (the most elaborate, which are unique to the style, are the crescent-shaped [[deer horn knives]] (Chinese: 鹿角刀; pinyin: Lùjiǎodāo). Baguazhang is also known for practicing with extremely large weapons, such as the ''bāguà jian'' (八卦劍), or bagua sword, and the ''bāguà [[dāo]]'' (八卦刀), or bagua broadsword. Other, more conventional weapons are also used, such as the staff (''gun''), spear (''qiang''), cane (''guai''), hook sword (''gou'') and the straight, double-edged sword ([[jian]]). Baguazhang practitioners are also known for being able to use anything as a weapon using the principles of their art.

Baguazhang contains an extremely wide variety of techniques as well as weapons, including various strikes (with palm, fist, elbow, fingers, etc.), kicks, joint locks, throws, and distinctively evasive circular footwork. As such, Baguazhang is considered neither a purely striking nor a purely grappling martial art. Baguazhang practitioners are known for their ability to "flow" in and out of the way of objects.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is the source of the theory of being able to fight multiple attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baguazhang's evasive nature is also shown by the practice of moving behind an attacker, so that the opponent cannot harm the practitioner.

Although the many branches of Baguazhang are often quite different from each other (some, like Cheng style, specialize in close-in wrestling and joint locks, while others, like some of the Yin styles, specialize in quick, long-range striking), all have circle walking, spiraling movement, and certain methods and techniques (piercing palms, crashing palms, etc.) in common.

Baguazhang's movements employ the whole body with smooth coiling and uncoiling actions, utilizing hand techniques, dynamic footwork, and throws.  Rapid-fire movements draw energy from the center of the abdomen. The circular stepping pattern also builds up [[centripetal force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Ballpits530.jpg|thumb|right|A child playing in a ball pit]] 
A '''ball pit''' (originally called "'''ball crawl'''" and also known as a '''ball pool''' or '''ball pond''') is a padded box or pool filled with small colorful hollow plastic balls generally no larger than {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter. Instead of balls, other spherical objects can be used, such as balloons. It is typically employed as a recreation and exercise for children.

[[File:Bollhav.jpg|thumb|A ball pit as part of a larger play area]]
Ball pits are often found at nurseries, [[carnival]]s, [[amusement park]]s, [[Family fun center|fun center]]s, [[fast-food restaurants]], and large [[video arcade]]s.  [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] and (now defunct) [[Discovery Zone]] formerly had ball pits and they were frequently incorporated into larger play structures, such as [[maze]]s, [[Playground slide|slide]]s, and [[jungle gym]]s.

Ball pits may be rented for [[party|parties]], and smaller versions are sold for use in the home. While ball pits are traditionally intended for children, some are large enough to accommodate [[adult]]s.

Ball pits may be used together with a [[trampoline]], or combining the two by filling a closed trampoline with the balls.

==Urban legends==
Beginning in the late 1990s, a number of [[urban legend]]s arose about children being severely injured or even killed due to ball-pit encounters with venomous [[snake]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blsnakes.htm|title=Snakes in the Ball Pit - Urban Legends|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[hypodermic needle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blneedle.htm|title=Needles Hidden Under Gas Pump Handles Are an Urban Legend|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no truth to these stories,&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20010831/bounce-carefully-in-ball-pit#1|title=Bounce Carefully in the Ball Pit|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers have reported finding dirty diapers, half-eaten food and syringes in ball pits.&lt;ref name="webmd"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the ''[[Rugrats]]'' episode, "Piggy's Pizza Palace", the Rugrats jump on a costumed pig named Piggy as an act of revenge to get Angelica's tickets back. Thus, it caused the ball pit structure to split right open and all of the balls fall out all over the restaurant.

'''Burra Katha''', also spelled Burrakatha, is an [[oral storytelling]] technique in the [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha]] tradition, performed in villages of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a [[Hindu]] mythological story ([[Jangam|Jangam Katha]]) or a contemporary social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Burrakatha loses sheen sans patronage| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-14/visakhapatnam/36332535_1_artistes-burrakatha-art-form |date=Jan 14, 2013| accessdate = 2013-09-02
| publisher = [[The Times of India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Burra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4U5AAAAIAAJ|title=Vidya Bharathi|last=Lectures|first=Bangalore University Dept of Publications and Extension|date=1977-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.

==Etymology==
"Burra" is referred to [[Tanpura|tambura]], a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. "Katha" means story.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burrakatha.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Burrakatha photo from Vepachedu research foundation]] --&gt;
Burra means a skull in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The shell resembles a [[human skull]]. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to [[veena]] and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.

==Alternative names==
Burrakatha refers to the art throughout [[Andhra Pradesh]], and there are local names in each region.
* Coastal region: Tamboora or Jangam or Tandanana Katha
* Rayalaseema: Tamboora or Tandana katha or suddulu
* Telangana: Tamboora or Sarada katha

==History==
Burrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as [[Jangam]] Katha. The [[jangam|jangams lingayats]] were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of [[Shiva|Lord Siva]]. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.

Popular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.

==Modern form==
The main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently.  The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.

The right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to "Wow!" "Aha!" and "That is it."

Whenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with "vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara" followed by the co-performers singing "tandhana tane tandhana na." It is also called 'tandana katha.'

==Significance==
Burra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during [[Navratri|Dussehra]] or [[Sankranti]] festival seasons to describe events in epics like [[Ramayan]] and [[Mahabharat]] and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.

It played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Burrakatha was banned in [[Madras]] by the British government and in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.

==Present==
Burrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.
That's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.
In past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.

So these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.

[[Daroji Eramma]] was a performer of Burra katha from [[Karnataka]].

'''Calligraphic projection''' is a system, often used for [[laser lighting display]]s, whereby one or more [[laser]] beams draws an image on a screen by reflecting the laser beam from one or more mirrors attached to a deflecting mechanism.

Analog [[oscilloscope]]s have customarily employed this kind of [[vector graphics]], as did a number of [[computer graphics]] terminals in the 1970s, such as the [[Tektronix 4014]].

Calligraphic projection is sometimes called [[Jules Antoine Lissajous|Lissajous]] projection, after the mathematical figure (and mathematician).

The material often contains Christian references, although this is not a requirement. Recently, notable performers like [[Victoria Jackson]], [[Tim Conway]], [[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]] and [[Patricia Heaton]] have appeared on a DVD series for the Christian market entitled, "Thou Shalt Laugh"&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoushaltlaugh.com/ Thou Shalt Laugh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223151828/http://www.thoushaltlaugh.com/ |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is increasingly being used as an [[outreach]], with the idea that a comedy show is a great way to bring people into church who may have never thought about coming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larryweaver.com/entertainment/christian-comedians.asp Christian Comedians]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is also used as a method to renew and refresh the spirit of church members, based on the Bible passage that says laughter does a heart good, like medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancomedyacts.com Christian Comedy Acts]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational humor''' is a branch of [[computational linguistics]] and [[artificial intelligence]] which uses [[computer]]s in [[humor research]]. It is a relatively new area, with the first dedicated conference organized in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Hulstijn, J, and Nijholt, A. (eds.). Proceedings of the International Workshop on Computational Humor. Number 12 in Twente Workshops on Language Technology, Enschede, Netherlands. University of Twente, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "computer model of a sense of humor" was suggested by
Suslov as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". I. General Algorithm. Biofizika SSSR 37, 318 (1992) [Biophysics 37, 242 (1992)]; https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2058.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of the general scheme of information processing shows the possibility of a specific malfunction, conditioned by the necessity of a quick deletion from consciousness of a false version. This specific malfunction can be identified with a humorous effect on psychological grounds: it exactly corresponds to incongruity-resolution theory. However, an essentially new ingredient, the role of timing, is added to the well-known role of ambiguity. In biological systems, a sense of humor inevitably develops in the course of evolution, because its biological function consists of quickening the transmission of the processed information into consciousness and in a more effective use of brain resources. A realization of this algorithm in neural networks&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". II. Realization in Neural Networks. Biofizika SSSR 37, 325 (1992) [Biophysics {\bf 37}, 249 (1992)] https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2061.&lt;/ref&gt; justifies naturally Spencer's hypothesis on the mechanism of laughter: deletion of a false version corresponds to zeroing of some part of the neural network and excessive energy of neurons is thrown out to the motor cortex, arousing muscular contractions.

A practical realization of this algorithm needs extensive databases, whose creation in the automatic regime was suggested recently.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, How to Realize "a Sense of Humour" in Computers? https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3197.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this magistral direction was not developed properly and subsequent investigations accepted somewhat specialized colouring.

==Joke generators==

===Pun generation===
An approach to analysis of humor is classification of jokes. A further step is an attempt to generate jokes basing on the rules that underlie classification.

Simple prototypes for computer [[pun]] generation were reported in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Lessard, G. and Levison, M. (1992). Computational modeling of linguistic humour: Tom Swifties. In ALLC/ACH Joint Annual Conference, Oxford, pages 175–178.&lt;/ref&gt; based on a [[natural language generator]] program, [[VINCI (software)|VINCI]]. [[Graeme Ritchie (scientist)|Graeme Ritchie]] and [[Kim Binsted]] in their 1994 research paper described a computer program, JAPE, designed to generate question-answer-type [[pun]]s from a general, i.e., non-humorous, lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Binsted, Graeme Ritchie (1994) "A symbolic description of punning riddles and its computer implementation." Research Paper 688, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, 1994, reported at the International Conference on Humor and Laughter, Luxembourg, 1993
*(conference proceeding version of the above) An implemented model of punning riddles. In Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-94), Seattle, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  (The program name is an acronym for "Joke Analysis and Production Engine".) Some examples produced by JAPE are:

:Q: What is the difference between leaves and a car?
:A: One you brush and rake, the other you rush and brake.

:Q: What do you call a strange market?
:A: A bizarre bazaar.

Since then the approach has been improved, and the latest report, dated 2007, describes the STANDUP joke generator, implemented in the [[Java programming language]].&lt;ref name=rmpwbd&gt;Graeme Ritchie, Ruli Manurung, Helen Pain, Annalu Waller, Rolf Black, Dave O'Mara. "[http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/g.ritchie/pages/papers/ijwcc07.pdf A practical application of computational humour]." In Cardoso, A. &amp; Wiggins, G. (Ed.) Proceedings of the 4th. International Joint Workshop on Computational Creativity, London, UK, 2007, pp. 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/standup-315.php STANDUP home page], with a link to free software download&lt;/ref&gt; The STANDUP generator was tested on children within the framework of analyzing its usability for language skills development for children with communication disabilities, e.g., because of [[cerebral palsy]]. (The project name is an acronym for "System To Augment Non-speakers' Dialog Using Puns" and an allusion to [[standup comedy]].) Children responded to this "language playground" with enthusiasm, and showed marked improvement on certain types of language tests.&lt;ref name=rmpwbd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/standup/cuttings/20060819_www.thecourier.co.uk.html "Laughter is the best therapy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610153820/http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/standup/cuttings/20060819_www.thecourier.co.uk.html |date=June 10, 2007 }}, ''The Courier'',  19 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5276366.stm "Joke software helps non-speakers"], ''[[BBC News]],'' 22 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The two young people, who used the system over a ten-week period, regaled their peers, staff, family and neighbors with jokes such as: "What do you call a spicy missile? A hot shot!" Their joy and enthusiasm at entertaining others was inspirational.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Joke recognition==
A statistical machine learning algorithm to detect whether a sentence contained a "[[That's what she said]]" [[double entendre]] was developed by Kiddon and Brun (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Chloe Kiddon and Yuriy Brun (2011). "[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P11/P11-2016.pdf That's What She Said: Double Entendre Identification."] In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 89–94, Portland, Oregon,
USA, June. Association for Computational Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an open-source Python implementation of Kiddon &amp; Brun's TWSS system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/tansaku/twss GitHub – tansaku/twss: A Python project inspired by the research of Chloé Kiddon and Yuriy Brun. Part of the Funniest Computer Ever Open Source initiative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A program to recognize [[knock-knock joke]]s was reported by Taylor and Mazlack.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J. M. and Mazlack, L. J. (2004). "Computationally recognizing wordplay in jokes". In ''Proceedings of Cognitive Science Conference'', pages 2166–2171, Stresa, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of research is important in analysis of human-computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uc.edu/News/NR.aspx?ID=6139 "UC Researchers Design Humorous 'Bot'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602033631/http://www.uc.edu/News/NR.aspx?ID=6139 |date=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An application of [[machine learning]] techniques for the distinguishing of joke texts from non-jokes was described by Mihalcea and Strapparava (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, R. and Strapparava, C. (2006). "Learning to laugh (automatically): Computational models
for humor recognition." ''[[Computational Intelligence (journal)|Computational Intelligence]]'', 22(2):126–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takizawa ''et al.'' (1996) reported on a [[heuristic]] program for detecting puns in the [[Japanese language]].&lt;ref&gt;Osamu Takizawa, Masuzo Yanagida, Akira Ito, and Hitoshi Isahara (1996). "On Computational Processing of Rhetorical Expressions – Puns, Ironies and Tautologies". In (Hulstijn and Nijholt, 1996), 39–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A possible application for the assistance in [[language acquisition]] is described in the section "Pun generation". Another envisioned use of joke generators is in cases of steady supply of jokes where quantity is more important than quality. Another obvious, yet remote, direction is automated joke appreciation.

It is known {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} that humans interact with computers in ways similar to interacting with other humans that may be described in terms of personality, politeness, flattery, and in-group favoritism. Therefore, the role of humor in [[human-computer interaction]] is being investigated. In particular, humor generation in [[user interface]] to ease communications with computers was suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Rada Mihalcea, carlo Strapparava, "Technologies That Make You Smile: Adding Humor to Text-Based Applications", ''[[IEEE Intelligent Systems]]'', 2006, vol. 21, no.5, pp. 33–39. DOI: http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2006.104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=curdir&gt;Graeme Ritchie (2001) "[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/21251/http:zSzzSzwww.dai.ed.ac.ukzSzhomeszSzgraemezSzpaperszSzcurrent_directions.pdf/graeme01current.pdf Current Directions in Computer Humor]", ''[[Artificial Intelligence Review]]''. 16(2): pages 119–135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mn&gt;[http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~anijholt/artikelen/ctit24_2002.pdf M.P. Mulder, A. Nijholt, (2002) "Humour Research: State of the Art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig McDonough implemented the Mnemonic Sentence Generator, which converts [[password]]s into humorous sentences.  Basing on the [[Theory of humor#Incongruity|incongruity theory of humor]], it is suggested that the resulting meaningless but funny sentences are easier to remember. For example, the password AjQA3Jtv is converted into "Arafat joined Quayle's Ant, while TARAR Jeopardized thurmond's vase".&lt;ref&gt;Craigh McDonough (2001) "Using Natural Language Processing for random Passwords", Technical Report, [[CERIAS]], [[Purdue University]] (unpublished), as quoted by Mulder and Nijholt (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related research==
[[John Allen Paulos]] is known for his interest in mathematical foundations of humor.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Allen Paulos]] (1980, 1982) "Mathematics and Humor: A Study of the Logic of Humor", 1982 paperback: {{ISBN|0-226-65025-1}}, Japanese translation, 1983, Dutch translation, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Mathematics and Humor: A Study of the Logic of Humor'' demonstrates structures common to humor and formal sciences (mathematics, linguistics) and develops a mathematical model of jokes based on [[catastrophe theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1512">The '''concert saloon''' was an American adaptation of the [[English people|English]] [[music hall]], and a precursor of variety and [[vaudeville]] theater. As in the music hall, [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] was served. The entertainment at the [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] was to hold the imbiber's attention, so they would imbibe more.

{{quote|The fact that the concert saloons featured a kind of particularly tawdry, low-end theatre as well as liquor and the new fad of "waiter girls"—and, in the minds of many, [[prostitution]]—was too much for many so-called respectable people to bear. As late as 1881, ''[[Nym Crinkle]]'' would point out, "they serve as the gathering places for idle and vicious people to drink beer, listen to execrable music, make assignations, and parade in the dirtiest market those common charms which they have to sell."

'''Counter-''Maniera''''' or '''Counter-Mannerism''' (variously capitalized and part-italicized) is a term in art history for a trend identified by some art historians in 16th-century Italian painting that forms a sub-category or phase of [[Mannerism]], the dominant movement in Italian art between about 1530 and 1590.  Counter-''Maniera'' or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the [[The_Reformation_and_art#Council_of_Trent|vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity]] in art issued by the [[Council of Trent]] in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of [[High Renaissance]] art, with "clarity in formal order and legibility in content".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; his longest passage explaining his term is on pp. 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was devised by the art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians.  Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his ''Painting in Italy, 1500–1600'', first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: "First ''Maniera'', High ''Maniera'', Counter-''Maniera'' and Late ''Maniera''".&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, 17; Freedberg had used the terms in earlier articles.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High ''Maniera'' remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-''Maniera'' in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high ''maniera'' style.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedberg's contemporary [[Federico Zeri]] had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term ''arte sacra'' ("sacred art") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-''Maniera'' may be in decline, as impatience with such "[[Style (visual arts)|style]] labels" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and characteristics==
The definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex,&lt;ref&gt;The subject of both Cropper and Smyth, and Shearman's Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so.  Many parts of Italy, led by [[Venice]] and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of ''maniera'' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 563, and many passages on specific artists&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded ''maniera'', without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as "counterpart" and "[[counterpoint]]", explaining that he intends "implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429 quoted, and ''passim'' on individual artists; Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characteristics of the ''maniera'' often retained in counter-''maniera'' works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedländer, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the ''maniera'' that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a [[decorum]] suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; Shearman, 168–169, 178–179; Friedländer, 6–10, and Part 1 generally&lt;/ref&gt; In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 657–660&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term counter-''maniera'' is not usually applied to the more radical [[Bologna|Bolognese]] reaction of the [[Carracci family|Carraccis]] from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was "a new and un-Maniera attitude to art";&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 566; Shearman, 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-''Maniera'' with "anti-Maniera", apparently reflecting "Anti-Mannerism", the term used by [[Walter Friedländer]] for the "palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting" that occurred "sometime around 1590".&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Part II, p. 47 quoted; Freedberg 606; for more on the "anti-Maniera" of [[Antonio Campi]] see 585–587, and for that of [[Scipione Pulzone]] see 658, and "non-Maniera" is also used; &lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term has not been extended to [[Northern Mannerism]].

Deciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in [[John Shearman]]'s ''Mannerism'' (1967), he picks [[Santi di Tito]]'s ''Vision of St Thomas Aquinas'' (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 624&lt;/ref&gt; Shearman's other main example of Counter-Mannerism is [[Federigo Barocci]], who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 632–640&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Many painters looked to revive the styles of [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of [[Michelangelo]]'s late work was important for many artists.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine biographer and critic [[Raffaello Borghini]], author of ''Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura'' published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Conclusion"; Borghini is not mentioned by Freedberg&lt;/ref&gt; but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: "Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 499, when discussing [[Girolamo Muziano]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period—even today—tended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of [[Gian Pietro Bellori]]'s ''Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a "pro-Bolognese" artistic account of Counter-''Maniera'' reform.&lt;ref&gt;Giovan Pietro Bellori, The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architect: A New Translation and Critical Edition, ed. Alice Sedgwick Wohl, Helmut Wohl and Tomaso Montanari (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">In [[English drama]], a '''domestic tragedy''' is a [[tragedy]] in which the tragic protagonists are ordinary middle-class or lower-class individuals. This subgenre contrasts with [[classical antiquity|classical]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[tragedy]], in which the protagonists are of kingly or [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter. 

The [[Ancient Greek]] theorist [[Aristotle]] had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world. 

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], the first domestic tragedies were written in the [[English Renaissance]]; one of the first was ''[[Arden of Faversham]]'' (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his adulterous wife. Other famous examples are ''[[A Woman Killed with Kindness]]'' (1607), ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' (1608), and ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' (1621).&lt;ref name="SturgessHeywood2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Sturgess|author2=Thomas Heywood|title=Three Elizabethan Domestic Tragedies: Arden of Faversham; a Yorkshire Tragedy; a Woman Killed with Kindness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kJ-JxlddCsC|date=23 February 2012|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-241-96146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Othello]]'' can be classified as a domestic tragedy.&lt;ref name="Benson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Benson|title=Shakespeare, 'Othello' and Domestic Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgug588s3jgC&amp;pg=PT10|date=15 December 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3766-1|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic tragedy disappeared during the era of [[Restoration drama]], when Neoclassicism dominated the stage, but it emerged again with the work of [[George Lillo]] and Sir [[Richard Steele]] in the [[Augustan drama|eighteenth century]].

{{Feminism sidebar |theory}}'''Feminist anthropology''' is a four-field approach to [[anthropology]] ([[Archaeology|archeological]], [[Biological anthropology|biological]], [[Cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to transform research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge, using insights from feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brodkin |first1=Karen |first2=Sandra |last2=Morgen |first3=Janis |last3=Hutchinson |title=Anthropology as White Public Space |journal=American Anthropologist |year=2011 |volume=113 |issue=4 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2011.01368.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, feminist anthropology challenges essentialist feminist theories developed in Europe and America. While feminists practiced cultural anthropology since its inception (see [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Hortense Powdermaker]]), it was not until the 1970s that feminist anthropology was formally{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Since then, it has developed its own subsection of the [[American Anthropological Association]] –&amp;nbsp;the [http://afa.americananthro.org/ Association for Feminist Anthropology]&amp;nbsp;– and its own publication, ''Voices''.

== History ==
Feminist anthropology has unfolded through three historical phases beginning in the 1970s: the anthropology of women, the anthropology of gender, and finally feminist anthropology.&lt;ref name="LewinIntro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewin | first = Ellen | title = Feminist anthropology: a reader | year = 2006 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden | isbn = 1405101962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to these historical phases, feminist anthropologists trace their genealogy to the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parezo | first = Nancy | title = Hidden scholars: women anthropologists and the Native American Southwest | year = 1993 | publisher = University of New Mexico Press | location = Albuquerque| isbn = 0826314287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erminnie A. Smith|Erminnie Platt Smith]], [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher]], [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], [[Frances Densmore]]—many of these women were self-taught anthropologists and their accomplishments faded and heritage erased by the professionalization of the discipline at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=WomenAnthros&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gacs | first1 = Ute D. | last2 = Kahn | first2 = Aisha| last3 = McIntyre | first3 = Jerrie | last4 = Weinberg | first4 = Ruth | title = Women anthropologists: selected biographies | year = 1989 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Champagne|isbn=0252060849}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent among early women anthropologists were the wives of 'professional' men anthropologists, some of whom facilitated their husbands research as translators and transcriptionists. Margery Wolf, for example, wrote her classic ethnography "The House of Lim" from experiences she encountered following her husband to northern Taiwan during his own fieldwork.&lt;ref name=WolfInterview&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rofel | first = Lisa | title = The outsider within: Margery Wolf and feminist anthropology | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 596–604 | publisher = [[American Anthropological Association]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2003.105.3.596 | date = September 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/aa.2003.105.3.596 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While anthropologists like [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]] are representatives of the history of feminist anthropology, female anthropologists of color and varying ethnicities also play a role in the theoretical concepts of the field. [[Hortense Powdermaker]], for example, a contemporary of Mead's who studied with British anthropological pioneer [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] conducted political research projects in a number of then a-typical settings: reproduction and women in Melanesia (Powdermaker 1933), race in the American South (Powdermaker 1939), gender and production in Hollywood (1950), and class-gender-race intersectionality in the African Copper Belt (Powdermaker 1962). Similarly, [[Zora Neale Hurston]], a student of [[Franz Boas]], the father of American anthropology, experimented with narrative forms beyond the objective ethnography that characterized the proto/pseudo- scientific writings of the time. Other African American women made similar moves at the junctions of ethnography and creativity, namely [[Katherine Dunham]] and [[Pearl Primus]], both of whom studied dance in the 1940s. Also important to the later spread of Feminist anthropology within other subfields beyond cultural anthropology was physical anthropologist Caroline Bond Day and archeologist [[Mary Leakey]].

The anthropology of women, introduced through Peggy Golde's "Women in the Field" and [[Michelle Rosaldo]] and [[Louise Lamphere]]'s edited volume ''[[Woman, Culture, and Society]]'', attempted to recuperate women as distinct cultural actors otherwise erased by male anthropologists' focus on men's lives as the universal character of a society. Male anthropologists, Golde argued specifically, rarely have access to women in tribes and societies because of the sexual threat they pose to these women.&lt;ref name=Golde&gt;{{cite book|last=Golde|first=Peggy|title=Women in the field: anthropological experiences|year=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0520054229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they receive the stories of men about women in instances when women are present at all. The male anthropologists' ignorance and the indigenous men's domination congeal to create instances where, according to Rosaldo and Lamphere, the asymmetry between women and men becomes universal.{{Dubious|date=February 2017}} A second anthropology of women would arise out of American engagements with  [[Friedrich Engels|Friedrich Engels']] [[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]], arguing that this universal asymmetry was not timeless, but a product of capitalist relations that came to dominate the global mode of production through colonialism.&lt;ref name=Leacock&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | title = Interpreting the origins of gender inequality: Conceptual and historical problems | journal = [[Dialectical Anthropology]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 263–284 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00249543 | date = February 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00249543 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As both approaches grew more vocal in their critique of male ethnographers' descriptions as one-sided, an 'add women and mix' approach to ethnography became popular, whereby women were not necessarily described at detail, but mentioned as part of the wider culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Schuller | first = Mark | title = Participation, more than add women and stir?

In the wake of [[Gayle Rubin]] and her critique of "the sex/gender system," the anthropology of women transformed into an anthropology of gender. Gender was a set of meanings and relationships related to but not isomorphic with biological sex. Women was not a universal community or category that was self-evident.&lt;ref name=Lugones&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lugones | first1 = María C. | last2 = Spelman | first2 = Elizabeth V. | title = Have we got a theory for you! Feminist theory, cultural imperialism and the demand for ‘the woman's voice’ | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages =573–581 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(83)90019-5 | date = 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-5395(83)90019-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of women of color feminism, the anthropology of gender critiqued the early goals of first-wave feminists and anthropologists as overly concerned with bourgeois social ambitions. It did so through a move from documenting the experience of women as a universal population to interpreting the place of gender in broader patterns of meaning, interaction, and power. This includes the work of women anthropologists [[Henrietta Moore]] and Ethel Albert. Moore contended that anthropology, even when carried out by women, tended to "[order] the world into a male idiom [. . .] because researchers are either men or women trained in a male oriented discipline".&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = Henrietta L. | title = Feminism and anthropology | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | location = Hoboken | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780745667997 | oclc = 18259349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology's theoretical architecture and practical methods, Moore argued, were so overwhelmingly influenced by sexist ideology (anthropology was commonly termed the "study of man" for much of the twentieth century) that without serious self-examination and a conscious effort to counter this bias, anthropology could not meaningfully represent female experience.

Today, feminist anthropology has grown out of the anthropology of gender to encompass the study of the female body as it intersects with or is acted upon by cultural, medical, economic, and other forces.&lt;ref name=FemEthnog&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Visweswaran | first = Kamala | title = Histories of feminist ethnography | journal = [[Annual Review of Anthropology]] | volume = 26 | issue =  | pages = 591–621 | publisher = [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.591 | date = October 1997 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.591 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes the expansion of feminist politics beyond cultural anthropology to physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archeology, as well as feminist anthropology becoming a site for connecting cultural studies, history, literature, and ethnic studies.

==Feminist Archaeology==

[[Feminist archaeology]] initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the epistemology espoused by the processual school of archaeological thought, such as [[Archaeological theory#Post-processual archaeology|symbolic and hermeneutic archaeologies]]. Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector’s 1984 paper Archaeology and the Study of Gender summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies, for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline)&lt;ref&gt;^ Hays-Gilpin, 2000:92. Feminist Scholarship in Archaeology. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 571:89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the image of the archaeologist was centered around the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”.&lt;ref&gt;^ Gero, 1985:342. Sociopolitics and the Woman-at-Home Ideology. American Antiquity 50:342-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, feminists in archeology have started to confront the issue of sexual assault during "field work" through scholarly research on the social life of archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/2013/04/13/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that s not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|first=Kate|last=Clancy|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biological Anthropology Field Experiences Web Survey, open to bioarcheologists, primatologists, and other subfields, revealed that 19% of women are sexually assaulted during fieldwork, with 59% of anthropologists—male and female—experiencing sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/04/26/a-can-of-worms-worth-opening/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist Cultural Anthropology ==
Feminist cultural anthropology deals with the concept of [[feminism]] through the lens of [[cultural anthropology]].  When combining these two fields of study, cultural anthropology can be approached in a non-binary way.  New information pertaining to research and knowledge from a scholarly perspective also has no restrictions.  This field of study may impact feminism and women and gender studies as well because it provides feminist analyses of culture from an anthropological perspective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Feminist Anthropology: Past, Present, and Future|url=|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=44|issue=6|pages=99–101|doi=10.5860/CHOICE.44-3361|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, women started attending undergraduate and graduate universities where the social sciences, which were at one time largely dominated by men, were now being practiced by men and women alike.  With more women in the social science disciplines, they started having an impact on how some issues were being dealt with in the social science fields, such as the emphasis on gender studies and the integration of women’s rights issues into these studies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender at the Crossroads of Knowledge : Feminist Anthropology in the Postmodern Era|last=Di Leonardo|first=Micaela|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women entering the social science fields had such a large impact on the feminist anthropology movement because before the 1980s, female anthropologists mostly focused on aspects such as family, marriage, and kinship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many female anthropologists reacted to this stereotype placed on them, as they wanted to focus on broader aspects of culture in the scholarly community. 

When feminist anthropology first developed, it was intended to be the subdiscipline of the anthropology of women.  However, feminist cultural anthropology arose as a subfield itself when anthropologists started to realize that women's and gender studies weren’t published as frequently as other topics in anthropology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As feminist anthropology began being practiced by more people and cultural aspects such as race, values, and customs started being considered, focuses on personal identity and differences between people in varying cultures became the main idea surrounding feminist cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Writing Culture|last=Behar|first=Ruth|last2=Gordon|first2=Deborah A|publisher=University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this advance, female anthropologists started focusing on all aspects of gender and sex and how they vary culturally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  With a focus on feminism through an anthropological lens, women’s role in society and their contributions to the social sciences formed itself a new subfield known as feminist cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Relationship with Feminism==
The relationships of feminist anthropology with other strands of academic feminism are uneasy. By concerning themselves with the different ways in which different cultures constitute gender, feminist anthropology can contend that the [[Sexism|oppression of women]] is not universal. Henrietta Moore argued that the concept of "woman" is insufficiently universal to stand as an analytical category in anthropological enquiry: that the idea of 'woman' was specific to certain cultures, and not a human universal. For some feminists, anthropologist [[Michelle Rosaldo]] wrote, this argument contradicted a core principle of their understanding of relations between men and women.&lt;ref name="Rosaldo"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Rosaldo, M.Z. |date=1980 |title=The Use and Abuse of Anthropology: Reflections on Feminism and Cross-Cultural Understanding |journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=389–417 |issn=0097-9740 |doi=10.1086/493727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary feminist anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]] argues that anthropology, which must deal with difference rather than seeking to erase it, is not necessarily harmed by this disagreement, but notes nonetheless that feminist anthropology faces resistance.&lt;ref name="Strathern"/&gt;

Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been [[marginalized]] and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} On the other hand, anthropologists' claims to include and engage with such other perspectives have in turn been criticised - local people are seen as the producers of [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], which only the western anthropologist can convert into social science theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Because feminist theorists come predominantly from the west, and do not emerge from the cultures they study (some of which have their own distinct traditions of feminism, like the [[Feminism in Latin America|grassroots feminism of Latin America]]), their ideas about feminism may contain western-specific assumptions that do not apply simply to the cultures they investigate. Rosaldo criticizes the tendency of feminists to treat other contemporary cultures as anachronistic, to see other parts of the world as representing other periods in western history - to say, for example, that gender relations in one country are somehow stuck at a past historical stage of those in another. Western feminists had, Rosaldo said, viewed women elsewhere as “ourselves undressed and the historical specificity of their lives and of our own becomes obscured”.&lt;ref name="Rosaldo"/&gt; Anthropology, Moore argued, by speaking ''about'' and not ''for'' women, could overcome this bias.

Marilyn Strathern characterised the sometimes antagonistic relationship between feminism and anthropology as self-sustaining, since “each so nearly achieves what the other aims for as an ideal relation with the world.".&lt;ref name="Strathern"/&gt; Feminism constantly poses a challenge to the androcentric orthodoxy from which anthropology emerges; anthropology undermines the [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentricism]] of feminism.

==The 'double difference'==
Feminist anthropology, [[Rayna Rapp]] argues, is subject to a 'double difference' from mainstream academia. It is a feminist tradition – part of a branch of scholarship, sometimes marginalized as an offshoot of [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]]ism and concerned with the experiences of women – who are marginalized by an androcentric orthodoxy. At the same time it addresses non-Western experience and concepts, areas of knowledge deemed peripheral to the knowledge created in the west. It is thus doubly marginalized.

Moore argues that some of this marginalization is self-perpetuating. By insisting on adhering exclusively to the 'female point of view', feminist anthropology constantly defines itself as 'not male' and therefore as inevitably distinct from, and marginal to, mainstream anthropology. Feminist anthropology, Moore says, effectively ghettoizes itself. Strathern argues that feminist anthropology, as a tradition posing a challenge to the mainstream, can never fully integrate with that mainstream: it exists to critique, to deconstruct, and to challenge.

The '''Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue''' ('''FIIRD''') was founded in 1999, sponsored by the [[Levant Foundation]] with the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland "to pursue its scholarly and humanistic goals with the main objective of fostering understanding of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism."  The main program of the FIIRD is to enhance knowledge and the critical examination of the wellsprings of each religious tradition and then to acquire the linguistic and strategic tools needed to study the normative scriptures of these religions without syncretism or proselytism.

==Projects and Goals==
In 2006 the FIIRD published a boxed set of the three Holy Books, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Holy Qur'an.

Another goal of the FIIRD, strongly supported by the [[Levant Foundation]], was to create a post-doctoral program at the [[University of Geneva]] in the field of interreligious and intercultural dialogue whereby several Fellows, each possessing a PhD in theology, philosophy, history or other humanities and dedicated to further their knowledge and understanding of the monotheistic religions, participate in approved research and publish their results all done with the goal of searching for peace between the Abrahamistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

The concept of '''friction of distance''' is based on the notion that [[distance]] usually requires some amount of [[Work (physics)|effort]], [[energy]], time, and/or other [[resource]]s to overcome.  Because of this "[[friction]]", spatial [[interaction]]s, especially [[transport]] and the particular case of [[human migration]], will tend to take place more often over shorter distances; amount and intensity of interaction will [[distance decay|decay with distance]].  Regardless of physical friction, the various [[cost]]s are metaphorically assumed to correspond to forces that impede movements.

Friction, be it physical or metaphorical, may be a continuous, smooth function or may contain jumps; it may be constant, linear, or nonlinear or a combination of jumps and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] effects, as with [[Intermodal freight transport]] and [[Intermodal passenger transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/frictionspace.html

In the [[United Kingdom]], sexism or [[gender inequality]] denotes the inconsistencies between individuals due to gender. The topic covers a variety of concerns from [[education]] to equal opportunity in terms of employment and wages.

==Legislation==
In response to the concerns, the government has implemented various legislation, especially concerning gender discrimination, both institutional and personal, in the workplace; the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act of 1975]] protects individuals from being discriminated against in employment, vocational training, education, the provision and sale of goods, facilities and services, premises and the exercise of public functions due to their sex/gender; this was amended by the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]]. The [[Equal Pay Act 1970|Equal Pay Act of 1970]] mandates [[equal pay for equal work]] regardless of an individual's sex/gender, and the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 also protect the rights of individuals who intend to undergo, are undergoing, or have undergone [[gender reassignment|sex reassignment]]. These Regulations pertain to pay and treatment in employment, self-employment and vocational training.

The Equality Acts of [[Equality Act 2006|2006]] and [[Equality Act 2010|2010]] served to codify and combine all equality enactments within Great Britain, and provide comparable protections across all equality strands.

The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) is a non-departmental public body which has responsibility for the promotion and enforcement of equality and non-discrimination laws in England, Scotland and Wales, while the [[Government Equalities Office]] is a government department charged with promoting and improving gender equality within the UK government itself, responsible for leading the Discrimination Law Review, and providing advice on all other forms of equality to other UK government departments. The GEO was formerly known as the Women and Equality Unit.

===Culture===
It has increasingly been observed&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, in Kristina Nelson, ''Narcissism in High Fidelity'' (2004) p. 19 {{ISBN|0595318045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Genz | first1 = Stéphanie | last2 = Brabon | first2 = Benjamin A. | title = Postfeminism: Cultural Texts and Theories | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUGpvXJe9NAC|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press | isbn = 9780748635801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that a pervasive '[[lad culture]]' has developed in the U.K., described as an ironic, self-conscious method for young males to adopt "an [[anti-intellectual]] position, scorning sensitivity and caring in favour of drinking, violence, and a pre-feminist and racist attitude to women as both [[sex object]]s and creatures from another species".&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, in Kristina Nelson, ''Narcissism in High Fidelity'' (2004) p. 19 {{ISBN|0595318045}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN special rapporteur]] on violence against women similarly concluded that Britain has a "boys' club sexist culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/boys-club-britain-is-more-sexist-than-italy-azerbaijan-and-india-says-un-human-rights-expert-9262615.html |title=Boys' club Britain is more sexist than Italy, Azerbaijan and India, says UN human rights expert |last=Morrison |first=Sarah |date=5 December 2010 |work=The Independent |accessdate=16 April 2014 |place=London |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905092306/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/wikileaks-hit-by-new-online-onslaught-2151570.html |archivedate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture has attracted wide criticism from feminist circles; [[Germaine Greer]] critiques it in her 2000 book ''The Whole Woman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures of Masculinity|author=Tim Edwards|pages=39–42|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-28480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|author1=Pamela Abbott |author2=Claire Wallace |author3=Melissa Tyler |year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-31258-2|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson, C.|year=2006|title=Lads and Ladettes in School: Gender and a Fear of Failure|location=Maidenhead|publisher=Open University Press|isbn=0335225918}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Kira Cochrane]] asserts that "it's a dark world that ''Loaded'' and the lad culture has bequeathed us".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/08/lad-culture-cochrane-loaded Kira Cochrane, "The dark world of lads' mags"]. Newstatesman.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators believe that lad culture has affected politics and decreased the ability of women to participate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wilkinson, Helen|date=1998-08-07|title=The day I fell out of love with Blair|work=[[New Statesman]]|volume=127|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies of industries such as the [[architecture]] profession found that lad culture had a negative impact on women completing their professional education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gates, Charlie|date=2003-07-11|title=Lad culture forces women to quit: RIBA-funded study looks at reasons behind profession's high female drop-out rate|work=Building Design|volume=1587|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, British [[Feminism|feminist]] writer [[Laura Bates]] founded the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], a website and [[social media]] presence whose aim is to document everyday examples of [[sexism]] as reported by contributors; the submissions are then collated by a small group of volunteers led by Emer O'Toole, a researcher at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]]. By April 2013 the site had collected 25,000 entries from 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Laura. [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/apr/16/everyday-sexism-project-shouting-back "The Everyday Sexism Project: a year of shouting back"], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Various U.K. media institutions have been labelled problematic with regards to sexism and gender discrimination - most notably being the [[Page 3]] feature found in the British [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which consists of a large photograph of a [[toplessness|topless]] female [[Glamour model#Glamour models|glamour model]] usually published on the newspaper's third page. In August 2012, the [[No More Page 3]] campaign emerged, sparking widespread discussion and receiving heavy support from [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]] MP [[Caroline Lucas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|first=news|title=Caroline Lucas in Page Three T-shirt protest during debate|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22873790|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=BBC news|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-party support from over [http://nomorepage3.org/letter-to-the-editor-signed-by-mps/ 140 other MPs].

A YouGov survey in October 2012 found differences in attitude toward Page 3 among readers of different newspapers; 61% of ''Sun'' readers wished to retain the feature, while 24 percent said that the newspaper should stop showing Page 3 women. However, only 4% of ''Guardian'' readers said ''The Sun'' should keep Page 3, while 86% said it should be abolished. The poll also found wide differences by gender, with 48% of men overall saying that Page 3 should be retained, but just 17% of women taking that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey Report |url= http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/6jyst3v95o/YG-Archive-Pol-Sun-results-021012-Page-3-girls.pdf |work=YouGov / The Sun Survey Results|publisher=YouGov|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
The U.K. has a persistent gender pay gap, the most significant factors associated with which are part-time work, education, the size of the firm a person is employed in, and occupational segregation (women are under-represented in managerial and high-paying professional occupations.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first= Victoria |last= Thomson |date= October 2006 |title= How Much of the Remaining Gender Pay Gap is the Result of Discrimination, and How Much is Due to Individual Choices? |journal= International Journal of Urban Labour and Leisure |volume= 7 |issue= 2 |url= http://www.ijull.co.uk/vol7/2/thomson.pdf |accessdate= September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing full-time roles, men in the U.K. tend to work slightly longer hours than women in full-time employment. Depending on the age bracket and percentile of hours worked men in full-time employment work between 1.35% and 17.94% more hours than women in full-time employment.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 2013 Provisional Results http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-328216&lt;/ref&gt; Even when taking the differences in hours worked into account, a pay gap still exists in the U.K., and typically increases with age and earnings percentile.&lt;ref&gt;A Look At The Gender Pay Gap By Age And Earning Power | http://www.octopus-hr.co.uk/hrmoz/article/the-gender-pay-gap-by-age-and-earning-power.aspx#sthash.IL6IGoYj.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Inequality in the context of education has greater implications in terms of future employment. Elements of the school curriculum still advocate certain gender-specific practices.

Boys lag behind girls at important educational milestones. At [[Key Stage 2]] girls outperform boys. The proportion of students achieving level 4 and above in reading, writing and maths, in 2015, in England, was 77% boys compared to 83% girls. The gap is wider for students who receive a free school meal. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CDP-2016-0207/CDP-2016-0207.pdf House of Commons Library International Men's Day Briefing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls outperform boys in headline [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] results. In state-funded schools, the gap in those achieving 5+ grades a*-C including English and maths is around 10 percentage points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Young women are more likely to enrol at university. In 2016 the gender gap in favour of women was the highest on record. "In England, young women are 36% more likely to apply to university and when both sexes are from disadvantaged backgrounds young women are 58% more likely to apply."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucas.com/corporate/news-and-key-documents/news/university-and-college-applicant-numbers-rise-02-ucas-reports|title=University and college applicant numbers rise by 0.2%, UCAS reports today|date=2016-02-03|newspaper=UCAS|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[sex education]] is not compulsory in the U.K.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=House of Lords votes against mandatory sex and relationship education in schools |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/01/28/house-of-lords-votes-against-mandatory-sex-and-relationship-education-in-schools/ |accessdate=17 April 2014 |newspaper=PinkNews |date=28 January 2014 |place=London |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[England and Wales]], the optional curriculum focuses mainly on biological areas such as the reproductive system, [[foetal development]], and the physical changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/legislation.htm Education Act 1996] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709095150/http://www.avert.org/legislation.htm |date=July 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion about relationships and gender roles is often neglected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] UNESCO Courier;Jul/Aug2000, Vol. 53 Issue 7/8, pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Bates remarked that "better sex and relationships education in schools is desperately needed" to teach areas around "healthy relationships, [[Rape#Consent|consent]], respect and sexual abuse" in response to tackling everyday sexism earlier in life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">The '''Heidelberg Research Architecture''' (HRA)&lt;ref&gt;http://hra.uni-hd.de&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Digital Humanities]] unit of the [[Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"]] at [[Heidelberg University]].
It embraces digital resource development, project consultation and trainings for researchers and students. The HRA’s specialists work with researchers and students at the Cluster to form an integrated digital humanities environment for transcultural studies. Its agenda ranges from developing the Tamboti ecosystem that allows transcultural relations to be traced and analysed across diverse media types (texts, images, films, audio) and disparate objects (texts, concepts, social networks), to offering hands-on workshops on digital humanities tools for researchers working at the Cluster and Heidelberg University. Furthermore, digital resources and their production are increasingly integrated into teaching environments. The HRA provides advice to researchers on how to conceptualize and implement digital resources to structure their research.
As a cooperation partner at local, national, and international level the HRA works together with partners from the public as well as the private sector.

==The Tamboti ecosystem==
At the core of the HRA’s work is the development of the Tamboti ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;http://tamboti.uni-hd.de&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamboti is modular, and currently (November 2014) features these modules:
* [[Metadata Object Description Schema|MODS]] editor
* Ziziphus [[Visual Resources Association#VRA Core Categories|VRA Core 4]] editor&lt;ref&gt;http://ziziphus-help.uni-hd.de&lt;/ref&gt;
* Atomic Wiki
Tamboti serves as central access point to data from several different collections, where users can store and share, but also edit and comment on it. The ecosystem facilitates research collaboration and academic exchange in the field of Digital Humanities. Tamboti contains multilingual bibliographical information on books and articles as well as research based metadata on image collections, videos and various forms of digital material. It is possible to search the different types of sources and establish semantically qualified relations between them. Tamboti's modular design makes it flexible to use and adopt for research. On the back-end Tamboti makes use of [[EXist|eXist-db]]. Data is stored in XML using international [[Metadata standards|metadata schema]], like [[Metadata Object Description Schema|MODS]], [[Metadata Authority Description Schema|MADS]], [[Visual Resources Association#VRA Core Categories|VRA Core 4]], or [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] which allows for both, interchangeability and sustainability of the knowledge. Tamboti is [[open source software]]. International metadata standards and terminologies are used to ensure sustainability.

[[File:M73 13.jpg|thumb|''The Fall of Babylon'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]] from the ''Apocalypse'' series, circa 1555, plate size: 11 ⅞ x 8 ⅜ in.]]

In [[visual art]], '''horror vacui''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|r|ər|_|ˈ|v|ɑː|k|juː|aɪ}}; from [[Latin]] "fear of empty space"), also '''kenophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] "fear of the empty"),&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Brown: ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1:&amp;nbsp;A−M. [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]], Oxford 1993, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an [[Work of art|artwork]] with [[Complexity|detail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/horror%20vacui]] horror vacui as defined in the Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term is associated with the Italian art critic and scholar [[Mario Praz]], who used it to describe the suffocating atmosphere and clutter of interior design in the [[Victorian age]].&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=Beverly, Massachusetts|isbn=1592535879|pages=128–9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older, and more artistically esteemed examples can be seen on [[Migration period art]] objects like the [[carpet page]]s of [[Insular art|Insular]] illuminated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]]. This feeling of meticulously filling empty spaces also permeates [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] Islamic art from ancient times to the present. Another example comes from ancient Greece during the [[Geometric Art|Geometric Age]] (1100 - 900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver [[Jean Duvet]] consistently exhibits horror vacui.

==Examples==
Some examples of horror vacui in art come from, or are influenced by, the [[mentally ill|mentally unstable]] and inmates of [[psychiatric hospitals]], such as [[Richard Dadd]] in the 19th century, and many modern examples fall under the category of [[Outsider Art]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horror vacui may have also had an impact, consciously or unconsciously, on [[graphic design]] by artists like [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] or [[Vaughan Oliver]], and in the [[underground comix]] movement in the work of [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and on later comic artists such as [[Mark Beyer (comics)|Mark Beyer]]. The paintings of Williams, [[Faris Badwan]], Emerson Barrett, [[Joe Coleman (painter)|Joe Coleman]] and [[Todd Schorr]] are further examples of horror vacui in the modern [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]] art movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The [[entheogen]]-inspired [[visionary art]] of certain [[indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] yarn paintings and the [[ayahuasca]]-inspired art of [[Pablo Amaringo]], often exhibits this style, as does the [[psychedelic art]] movement of the [[1960s counterculture]]. Sometimes the patterned art in clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric [[Mola (art form)|molas]] of [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] people and the traditional clothing on [[Shipibo-Conibo]] people.

The artwork in the [[Where's Wally?]] series of children's books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique ([[Malangatana Ngwenya]]) also fill the canvas in this way.

The arrangement of [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[hieroglyphs]] suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs are repeated or [[phonetic complement]]s added to prevent gaps.

Horror vacui also strikes mapmakers. In the times of the [[Age of Discovery|Discoveries]], for instance, it was common for cartographers to fill in the ''[[Terra incognita]]'' or the poorly known oceans with [[Sea monster|monsters]] or simply with the [[Scale (map)|scale]] of the map, rather than to leave them blank.

==Current usage and meaning==
{{double image|right|Only Two Colours.jpg|150|Mango store in Barcelona.jpg|150|''Horror vacui'' and value perception}}
There is an inverse relationship between ''horror vacui'' and value perception, and commercial designers favour [[minimalism]] in shop window displays and advertising to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals more to affluent and well-educated audiences.&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden" /&gt;


==Analogy==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The term is also used as an analogy to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Horror vacui (physics)|idea]] that a physical vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected.  This was widely believed up to the time of [[Rene Descartes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2558">The word '''indignation''' is used to describe strong displeasure at something considered unjust, offensive, insulting or unrighteous.

==History==

The term was coined in [[France]] during the 12th Century. It comes from the Latin word ''indignationem'', meaning displeasure. In [[nominative]] form, ''indignationem'' is ''indignatio''. ''Indignation'' is a noun of action from the past participle stem of ''indignari'', meaning unworthy, to be angry at, or to be displeased with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=indignation|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==

According to Cicero’s ''De Inventione'', Book I, “indignation is a kind of speech by which the effect produced is, that great hatred is excited against a man, or dislike of some proceeding is originated.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/cicero/dnv1-4.htm|title=Cicero's De Inventione, Book I, translated by C. D. Yonge, at Peitho's Web|work=classicpersuasion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is for the speaker to create anger projected towards the opponent or the accused such that the speaker is seen more positively than the opponent. One of the features of ''indignatio'' is that it cannot function without a target of displeasure. To successfully employ the technique, the speaker must have a target, an audience with which the speaker identifies, and a desired reaction. If a speaker achieves a reaction from the audience in which they are displeased with his opponent, then the speaker has successfully employed ''indignation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhetconcepts.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/indignatio-overview/|title=Indignatio: Overview|work=Rhetorical Devices and Concepts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle==

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his Book II, Chapter 9, “indignation is the emotion most directly opposed to pity.” Aristotle also writes “Indignation is pain caused by the sight of undeserved good fortune.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.cs.uri.edu/courses/fall2007/csc305/Schedule/rhetoric/rhet29.htm|title=Aristotle's Rhetoric: Book II - Chapter 9|work=uri.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms indignation and indignatio are closely related in part by their common negative emotionality and anger. A speaker may successfully employ indignatio and the audience will feel indignation towards the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet2-9.html|title=Book II - Chapter 9|work=eserver.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Integrated human studies''' is an emerging educational field that equips people with [[knowledge]] and competencies across a range of disciplines to enable them to address the challenges facing [[Human|human beings]] this century. It differs from other [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] educational initiatives in that its [[curriculum]] is purpose designed rather than simply an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgamation]] of existing disciplines.

[[Kyoto University]] in Japan has offered a formal course in Integrated Human Studies since 1992 when it reorganized its College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and renamed it the Faculty of Integrated Human Studies. This was subsequently (in 2003) integrated with the Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies to create the new Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soujin/index_e.php Kyoto University] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Western Australia]] established the Center for Integrated Human Studies in early 2008. This center brings together the [[science]]s, [[social science]]s, [[Arts and Humanities in Higher Education|arts and humanities]] to focus on the nature and future of humankind. Its fundamental concern is to promote human well-being at an individual, local and global level within a sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.uwa.edu.au Integrated Human Studies, University of Western Australia] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Integration of disciplinary fields has arisen as a response to the “increasing [[Specialization of knowledge|specialization]] of [university] courses to meet the demands of [[Technological change|technological progress]], [[economic growth]] and [[Vocational education|vocational training]]”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Neville. [http://u08.cgpublisher.com/proposals/237/index_html Abstract for World Universities Forum] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the development of ever narrower fields of study at tertiary level. Proponents of integrated human studies believe that a broader, interdisciplinary approach is needed to enable future [[Decision-making|decision-makers]] to grasp the complexities of the issues facing humankind in the [[21st century]] and craft workable solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5122">'''Interpretive planning''' is an initial step in the planning and design process for [[informal learning]]-based institutions like [[museum]]s, [[zoo]]s, [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]]s, nature centers, [[botanical garden]]s, heritage sites, parks and other cultural facilities where interpretation is used to communicate messages, stories, information and experiences. It is a decision-making process that blends management needs and resource considerations with visitor needs and desires to determine the most effective way to communicate a message to a targeted audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.definitionsproject.com/definitions/def_full_term.cfm National Association for Interpretation]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretation at [[informal learning]] institutions builds on [[Freeman Tilden]]’s principles of [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]], focusing especially on ''relating'' content in a meaningful way to a visitor’s own experience, ''provoking'' emotion, thought or further inquiry into a subject. 
The communication goals of interpretation at [[Mission statement|mission-based]] institutions are based on achieving previously specified outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagedestination.com/interpretive-planning.aspx Heritage Destination Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most interpretive plans are based on a [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach to interpretation]], and therefore, place emphasis on which themes are important to communicate to various audiences.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive Planning: The 5-M Model for Successful Planning Projects|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretive planning may also guide how audiences will react to and interact with a particular site or exhibit. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/interpretive-planner-insights/[[History Associates]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An interpretive plan establishes these specific goals for an institution’s market(s) and builds a structured vision of how to achieve them by communicating to an audience through appropriate and meaningful experiences. It combines developing, organizing and analyzing content into relevant and engaging messages, with creating exciting ways for visitors to experience this content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldrichpears.com [[AldrichPears Associates]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  An interpretive plan establishes the communication process, through which meanings and relationships of the cultural and natural world, past and present, are revealed to a visitor through experiences with objects, artifacts, landscapes, sites, exhibits and people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpcan.ca/new/ Interpretation Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

To effectively engage a visitor and achieve these objectives, as well as any other institutional objectives and requirements (financial, operational, environmental, etc.), an interpretive plan is built through addressing the following issues:  
# Why do you want to interpret something?
# Who should be involved in the interpretive process?
# What are you interpreting?
# Who you are interpreting for?
# What messages do you want to communicate?
# What are your specific objectives?
# What media will you use?
# How will your interpretation be implemented?
# How will it be evaluated?
# How will it be maintained? &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/heritage-interpretation/interpretive-planning/ Scottish Natural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting product provides a vision for the future of [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]], [[education]], and visitor experience opportunities. It identifies and analyzes interpretation, education, and visitor experience goals and issues and recommends the most effective, efficient, and practical ways to address those goals and issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/hfc/products/ip-lrip.htm [[National Park Service]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The plan guides the further design and development of the project, becoming a resource for [[architecture]], [[Exhibit design|exhibit development]] and [[fundraising]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woed.com/services/master.html West Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonah''' or '''Jonas'''{{efn|{{Hebrew Name|יוֹנָה|Yona, Biblically transliterated '''Yonah'''|Yônā|dove}}; {{lang-ar|يونس}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūnus, Yūnis}}'' or {{lang|ar|يونان}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūnān }}''; [[Latin]]: ''Ionas''}} is the name given in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]/[[Old Testament]]) to a [[prophet]] of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] in about the 8th century [[Common Era|BCE]]. He is the eponymous central figure of the [[Book of Jonah]], in which he is called upon by [[Yahweh|God]] to travel to [[Nineveh]] and warn its residents to repent of their [[sin]]s or face [[Divine retribution|divine wrath]]. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to [[Tarshish#In later history|Tarshish]]. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Three days later, after Jonah agrees to go to Nineveh, the fish vomits him out onto the shore. Jonah successfully convinces the entire city of Nineveh to repent, but waits outside the city in expectation of its destruction. God shields Jonah from the sun with a [[kikayon|plant]], but later sends a worm to cause it to wither. When Jonah complains of the bitter heat, God rebukes him.

In [[Judaism]], the story of Jonah represents the teaching of ''[[Repentance in Judaism|teshuva]]'', which is the ability to repent and be forgiven by [[God in Judaism|God]]. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] calls himself "greater than Jonah" and promises the [[Pharisees]] "the sign of Jonah", which is [[Resurrection of Jesus|his resurrection]]. Early [[Christianity|Christian]] interpreters viewed Jonah as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] for Jesus. Later, during the [[Reformation]], Jonah came to be seen instead as an [[archetype]] for the "envious Jew". Jonah is regarded as a prophet in [[Islam]] and the [[Bible|biblical]] narrative of Jonah is repeated, with a few notable differences, in the [[Quran]]. Mainstream [[Biblical criticism|Bible scholars]] generally regard the Book of Jonah as [[fiction]]al{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} and often at least partially [[satire|satirical]],{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=105–107}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}} but the character of Jonah may have been based on the historical prophet of the same name mentioned in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|14:25|HE}}.

Although the word "whale" is often used in English versions of the Jonah story, the Hebrew text actually uses the phrase  ''dag gadol'', which means "giant fish". In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the species of the fish that swallowed Jonah was the subject of speculation for [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]], who interpreted the story as an account of a historical incident. Some modern scholars of folklore have noted similarities between Jonah and other legendary figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]] and the Greek hero [[Jason]].

==Book of Jonah==
[[File:Pieter Lastman - Jonah and the Whale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Jonah and the Whale'' (1621) by [[Pieter Lastman]]]]
Jonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which [[Yahweh|God]] commands him to go to the city of [[Nineveh]] to prophesy against it "for their great wickedness is come up before me,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Jonah instead attempts to flee from "the presence of the Lord" by going to [[Jaffa]] (sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as ''Joppa'' or ''Joppe''), and sailing to [[Tarshish#In later history|Tarshish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:3|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, [[Cleromancy|cast lots]] and discover that Jonah is to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:4-7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah admits this and states that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:8-12|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail and they are eventually forced to throw Jonah overboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:13-15|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the storm calms and the sailors then offer sacrifices to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:15-16|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah is miraculously saved by being swallowed by a large fish, in whose belly he spends three days and three nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the great fish, Jonah prays to God in his affliction and commits to thanksgiving and to paying what he has vowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:1-9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God then commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dore jonah.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''[[Gustave Doré's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Jonah Preaching to the Ninevites]]'' (1866) by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

God again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and prophesy to its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:1-2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time he goes and enters the city, crying, "In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:2-4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people of Nineveh begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king of Nineveh puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer, and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:6-9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire city is humbled and broken with the people (and even the animals)&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} in sackcloth and ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Displeased by this, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:1-4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then leaves the city and makes himself a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God causes a plant (in Hebrew a ''[[kikayon]]'') to grow over Jonah's shelter to give him some shade from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:6|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant's root and it withers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah, now being exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|And God said to Jonah: "Art thou greatly angry for the Kikayon?" And he said: "I am greatly angry, even unto death."&lt;br /&gt;And the LORD said: "Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night;&lt;br /&gt;and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?"|Book of Jonah, {{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:9-11|9|chapter 4, verses 9-11}}}}

The Book of Jonah (Yonah יונה) is one of the twelve [[minor prophets]] included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by [[Elijah]] the prophet in {{bibleverse||1 Kings|17|9}}.{{sfn|Green|2005|pages=126–127}} Another tradition holds that he was the son of the [[woman of Shunem]] brought back to life by [[Elisha]] in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|4|9}}{{sfn|Green|2005|page=127}} and that he is called the "son of Amittai" (''Truth'') due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|17:24|9}}.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=127}} The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on [[Yom Kippur]] – the Day of Atonement, as the [[Haftarah]] at the afternoon [[mincha]] prayer.{{sfn|Mirsky|1990|page=354}}{{sfn|Isaacs|2006|page=65}} According to [[Rabbi Eliezer]], the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and the inside of its mouth was like a [[synagogue]];{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} the fish's eyes were like windows{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}}

According to the [[Midrash]], while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the [[Leviathan]] would eat them both.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} Jonah promised the fish that he would save them.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was [[circumcision|circumcized]], and realized that he was protected by the [[God in Judaism|Lord]],{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} The medieval Jewish scholar and rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (1092 – 1167) argued against any literal interpretation of the Book of Jonah,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=20}} stating that the "experiences of all the prophets except Moses were visions, not actualities."{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=20}} The later scholar [[Isaac Abarbanel]] (1437 – 1509), however, argued that Jonah could have easily survived in the belly of the fish for three days,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=18}} because "after all, fetuses live nine months without access to fresh air."{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=18–19}}

[[Repentance in Judaism|Teshuva]] – the ability to repent and be forgiven by God – is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father "Amitai" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of [[Nineveh]] to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, "fasting, including the sheep," and the Jewish scripts are critical of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Babylonian Talmud | chapter = Sanhedrin | at = 61a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth.&lt;ref&gt;Bashevkin, Dovid.

====In the Book of Tobit====
Jonah is mentioned twice in the fourteenth chapter of the [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Tobit]],{{sfn|Bredin|2006|pages=47–50}} the conclusion of which finds Tobit's son, Tobias, at the extreme age of 127 years, rejoicing at the news of Nineveh's destruction by [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Ahasuerus]] in apparent fulfillment of Jonah's prophecy against the Assyrian capital.{{sfn|Bredin|2006|pages=47–50}}

====In the New Testament====
In the [[New Testament]], Jonah is mentioned in {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:38–41|9}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|16:4|9}} and in {{bibleverse||Luke|11:29–32|9}}.{{sfn|Limburg|1993|page=39}} In the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Jesus]] makes a reference to Jonah when he is asked for a sign by some of the scribes and the [[Pharisees]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=167}} Jesus says that the sign will be the [[Typology (theology)#Example of Jonah|sign of Jonah]]:{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=167}} Jonah's restoration after three days inside the great fish prefigures [[Resurrection of Jesus|His own resurrection]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}

But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here."|Gospel of Matthew, {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|12:39–41|NIV}} ([[New International Version]])}}

Jonah is regarded as a saint by a number of [[Christian]] denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the ''[[Roman Martyrology|Martyrologium Romanum]]''.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; On the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]], Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian calendar]]; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lives of all saints commemorated on September 22 |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://oca.org/saints/all-lives/2017/09/22+%22Prophet+Jonah%22 |publisher=Orthodox Church in America |date=22 September 2017 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration of the Prophet Jonah |url=http://armenianchurch.ge/en/component/content/article/36-february/80-prophetjonah |publisher=Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Holy Church in Georgia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration of the 12 Minor Prophets |url=http://armenianchurch.ge/en/component/content/article/41-july/127-12minorprophets |publisher=Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Holy Church in Georgia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration Day of the 12 Minor Prophets. 24 July 2018|url=http://ststepanos.org/calendar/commemoration-day-of-the-12-minor-prophets/2018-07-24/ |publisher=Saint Stepanos Armenian Apostolic Church of Elberon in New Jersey |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the [[Fast of Nineveh]] in [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] Churches.&lt;ref name=SycOrth&gt;{{cite web|title=Three day fast of Nineveh |url=http://sor.cua.edu/Feast/NinevehFast.html |publisher=Syriac Orthodox Resources |date=8 February 1998 |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church]] on 22 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Commemoration of Jonah, Prophet, 22 September |url=https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Lutheran+Church+Missouri+Synod%22%22The+Commemoration+of+Jonah,+Prophet,+22+September%22 |publisher=Concordia and Koinonia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian theology|Christian theologians]] have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] for [[Jesus Christ]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–20}} Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus's crucifixion]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–13}} and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus's resurrection]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–13}} [[Saint Jerome]] equates Jonah with Jesus's more [[nationalism|nationalistic]] side,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=20}} and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that "Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people."{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=20}}

Other Christian interpreters, including [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Martin Luther]], have taken a directly opposite approach,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=23–25}} regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} Luther likewise concludes that the ''kikayon'' represents Judaism,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=23–24}} and that the worm which devours it represents Christ.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=24}} Luther also questioned the idea that the Book of Jonah was ever intended as literal history,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} commenting that he found it hard to believe that anyone would have interpreted it as such if it had never been included in the Bible.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Luther's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=24–26}} [[J. D. Michaelis]] comments that "the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against "the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth."{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} [[Albert Eichhorn]] was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=25–26}}

[[John Calvin]] and [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=32–33}} While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of [[Hell]], intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=34–36}} Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} describing the sailors on the boat as "hard and iron-hearted, like [[Cyclops]]",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} the penitence of the Ninevites as "untrained",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} and the king of Nineveh as a "novice".{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the [[archetype|archetypal]] [[dissident]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} Hooper deplores such dissidents,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} decrying: "Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!"{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=40}} In the eighteenth century, German professors were forbidden from teaching that the Book of Jonah was anything other than a literal, historical account.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}}

===In Islam===

====In the Quran====
'''Jonah''' ([[Arabic]]: يُونُس Yūnus) is the title of the [[tenth chapter of the Quran]]. He is traditionally viewed as highly important in [[Islam]] as a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] who was faithful to [[God in Islam|Allah]] and delivered His messages. Jonah is mentioned four times in the [[Quran]]{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} and is the only one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]] to be mentioned by name.&lt;ref name="Islam, pg. 348" /&gt; In [[Surah]] 68:48, Jonah is called '''Dhul-Nun''' ([[Arabic]]: '''ذو النون'''; meaning ''The One of the Fish'').{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} In 4:163 and 6:86, he is referred to as "an apostle of Allah".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} Surah 37:139-148 retells the full story of Jonah:{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}}

{{Quote|So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).&lt;br&gt;When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,&lt;br&gt;He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:&lt;br&gt;Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.&lt;br&gt;Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,&lt;br&gt;He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the [[Last Judgment|Day of Resurrection]].&lt;br&gt;But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,&lt;br&gt;And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.&lt;br&gt;And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.&lt;br&gt;And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.|Quran, chapter 37 ([[As-Saaffat]]), [[ayah|verses]] 139–148&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Quran never mentions Jonah's father,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} but [[Muslim]] [[tradition]] teaches that Jonah was from the [[tribe of Benjamin]] and that his father was [[Amittai]].&lt;ref name="Islam, pg. 348"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Yunus'', pg. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonah is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. In some instances, Jonah's name is spoken of with praise and reverence by Muhammad. According to historical [[Hadith|narrations about Muhammad's life]], after ten years of receiving revelations, Muhammad went to the city of [[Ta’if]] to see if its leaders would allow him to preach his message from there rather than [[Mecca]], but he was cast from the city by the people. He took shelter in the garden of Utbah and Shaybah, two members of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. They sent their servant, [[Addas]], to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. "The town of Jonah the just, son of Amittai!" Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Jonah. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. "We are brothers" Muhammad replied. "Jonah was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God." Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized from ''The Life of the Prophet'' by [[Ibn Hisham]] Volume 1 pp. 419–421&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sayings of Muhammad, in the collection of [[Imam Bukhari]], says that Muhammad said "One should not say that I am better than Jonah".&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|55|608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wheeler|2002|page=172}}{{sfn|Graham|1977|page=167}}{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} A similar statement occurs in a hadith written by [[Yazid I|Yunus bin Yazid]], the second [[caliph]] of the [[Umayyad Dynasty]].{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} Umayya ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Jonah not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Judgement Day,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} but, because of his prayer, Jonah "stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}}

The ninth-century Persian historian [[Al-Tabari]] records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, "none of his bones or members were injured".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Jonah to see the "wonders of the deep"{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=74}} and that Jonah heard all the fish singing praises to Allah.{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=74}} [[Kisai Marvazi]], a tenth-century poet, records that Jonah's father was seventy years old when Jonah was born{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} and that he died soon afterwards,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} leaving Jonah's mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a [[cornucopia]].{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}}

==Scholarly interpretations==
===Historicity===
The consensus of mainstream [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] holds that the contents of the [[Book of Jonah]] are entirely ahistorical.{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=140}}{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} Although the prophet Jonah allegedly lived in the eighth century BCE,{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} the Book of Jonah was written centuries later during the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=15–16}} The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] used in the Book of Jonah shows strong influences from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} and the cultural practices described in it match those of the Achaemenid Persians.{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} Many scholars regard the Book of Jonah as an intentional work of [[parody]] or [[satire]].{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=105–107}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|pages=140–142}}{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} If this is the case, then it was probably admitted into the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]] by sages who misunderstood its satirical nature{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=106–107}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} and mistakenly interpreted it as a serious prophetic work.{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=106–107}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}}

While the Book of Jonah itself is considered fiction,{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=140}}{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} Jonah himself may have been a historical prophet;{{sfn|Kripke|1980|pages=67–68}} he is briefly mentioned in the [[Books of Kings|Second Book of Kings]]:{{sfn|Doyle|2005|page=124}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}}
{{quote|He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of [[Hama]]th unto the sea of the [[Arabah]], according to the word of the [[Yahweh|LORD]], the [[National god|God of Israel]], which He spoke by the hand of His servant Jonah the son of [[Amittai]], the prophet, who was of [[Gath-hepher]].|{{bibleverse|2 Kings|14:25|HE}}, JPS (1917)}}
Most scholars believe that the anonymous author of the Book of Jonah may have seized upon this obscure prophet from 2 Kings and used him as the basis for the fictional character of Jonah,{{sfn|Doyle|2005|pages=124–125}} but some have contended that the figure of Jonah himself is entirely legendary.{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}

===Parodic elements===
[[File:Nineveh Adad gate exterior entrance far2.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Modern restoration of the [[Adad]] gate at Nineveh in a photograph taken prior to the gate's total destruction by [[ISIL]] in April 2016.{{sfn|Romey|2016}} The Book of Jonah exaggerates the size of Nineveh far beyond what it actually was historically.{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}}]]
The views expressed by Jonah in the Book of Jonah are a [[parody]] of views held by members of Jewish society at the time when it was written.{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}}{{sfn|Band|2003|page=106}}{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} The primary target of the satire may have been a faction whom [[Morton Smith]] calls "Separationists",{{sfn|Band|2003|page=105}} who believed that God would destroy those who disobeyed him,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} that sinful cities would be obliterated,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} and that God's mercy did not extend to those outside the [[Abrahamic covenant]].{{sfn|Band|2003|page=105}} McKenzie and Graham remark that "Jonah is in some ways the most 'orthodox' of Israelite theologians – to make a theological point."{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} Jonah's statements throughout the book are characterized by their militancy,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=142}} but his name ironically means "dove",{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=142}} a bird which the ancient Israelites associated with peace.{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}

Jonah's rejection of God's commands is a parody of the obedience of the prophets described in other Old Testament writings.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=22}} The king of Nineveh's instant repentance parodies the rulers throughout the other writings of the Old Testament who disregard prophetic warnings, such as [[Ahab]] and [[Zedekiah]].{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} The readiness to worship God displayed by the sailors on the ship and the people of Nineveh contrasts ironically with Jonah's own reluctance,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=23}} as does Jonah's greater love for ''kikayon'' providing him shade than for all the people in Nineveh.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=23}}

The Book of Jonah also employs elements of [[absurdist fiction|literary absurdism]];{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} it exaggerates the size of the city of Nineveh to an implausible degree{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} and incorrectly refers to the administrator of the city as a "king".{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} According to scholars, no human being could realistically survive for three days inside a fish,{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} and the description of the livestock in Nineveh fasting alongside their owners is "silly".{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} The motif of a protagonist being swallowed by a giant fish or whale became a stock [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of later satirical writings.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|pages=74–81}} Similar incidents are recounted in [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]]'s ''[[True History|A True Story]]'', which was written in the second century CE,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|page=76-77}} and in the novel ''[[Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia]]'', published by [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]] in 1785.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|pages=77–78}} The story of a man surviving after being swallowed by a whale or giant fish is classified as [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|ATU]] 1889G.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|page=78}}

Though it is often called a whale today, the Hebrew, as throughout scripture, refers to no species in particular, simply saying "great fish" or "big fish" (whales are today classified as [[mammal]]s and not fish, but no such distinction was made in antiquity).

At some point ''cetus'' became synonymous with "whale" (the study of whales is now called ''[[cetology]]''). In his 1534 translation, [[William Tyndale]] translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as "greate fyshe" and the word ''kétos'' (Greek) or ''cetus'' (Latin) in {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:40|9}} as "whale". Tyndale's translation was later incorporated into the [[King James Version|Authorized Version]] of 1611. Since then, the "great fish" in Jonah 2 has been most often interpreted as a whale. In English some translations use the word "whale" for Matthew 12:40, while others use "sea creature" or "big fish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=How Did God Do It?

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]], interpreting the Jonah story as a historical account, became obsessed with trying to identify the exact species of the fish that swallowed Jonah.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=42–45}} In the mid-nineteenth century, [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], professor of Hebrew at [[Oxford University]], claimed that the Book of Jonah must have been authored by Jonah himself{{sfn|Green|2011|page=48}} and argued that the fish story must be historically true, or else it would not have been included in the Bible.{{sfn|Green|2011|page=48}} Pusey attempted to scientifically catalogue the fish,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=47–48}} hoping to "shame those who speak of the miracle of Jonah's preservation in the fish as a thing less credible than any of God's other miraculous doings".{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=48}}

The debate over the fish in the Book of Jonah played a major role during [[Clarence Darrow]]'s cross-examination of [[William Jennings Bryan]] at the [[Scopes Trial]] in 1925.{{sfn|Smolla|1997}}{{sfn|Lidz|2016}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Darrow asked Bryan "When you read that... the whale swallowed Jonah... how do you literally interpret that?"{{sfn|Smolla|1997}} Bryan replied that "a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both of them do what He pleases."{{sfn|Smolla|1997}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Bryan ultimately admitted that it was necessary to interpret the Bible,{{sfn|Smolla|1997}} and is generally regarded as having come off looking like a "buffoon".{{sfn|Lidz|2016}}

The largest whales—[[baleen whale]]s, a group which includes the [[blue whale]]—eat [[plankton]] and "it is commonly said that this species would be choked if it attempted to swallow a herring."&lt;ref&gt;Lydekker's New Natural History, Vol, III, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  As for the [[whale shark]], Dr. E. W. Gudger, an Honorary Associate in [[Ichthyology]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], notes that, while the whale shark does have a large mouth,{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} its throat is only four inches wide, with a sharp elbow or bend behind the opening,{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} meaning that not even a human arm would be able to pass through it.{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} He concludes that "the whale shark is not the fish that swallowed Jonah."{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}}

==Suggested connections to legends==
[[File:Chapiteau Mozac Jonas 1.JPG|thumb|Jonah being swallowed by a great toothed sea-monster. Sculpted column capital from the nave of the abbey-church in [[Mozac]], France, 12th century.]]
[[Joseph Campbell]] suggests that the story of Jonah parallels a scene from the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', in which [[Gilgamesh]] obtains a plant from the bottom of the sea.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} In the Book of Jonah, a [[worm]] (in Hebrew ''tola'ath'', "maggot") bites the shade-giving plant's root causing it to wither;{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} whereas in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet and plucks his plant from the floor of the sea.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|pages=118–119}} Once he returns to the shore, the rejuvenating plant is eaten by a serpent.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=119}}

Campbell also noted several similarities between the story of Jonah and that of [[Jason]] in Greek mythology.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} The Greek rendering of the name Jonah is ''Jonas'', which differs from ''Jason'' only in the order of sounds—both ''o''s are [[omega]]s suggesting that Jason may have been confused with Jonah.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} Gildas Hamel, drawing on the Book of Jonah and [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] sources—including [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] and the accounts of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] and [[Argonautica|Orphic Argonautica]]—identifies a number of shared motifs, including the names of the heroes, the presence of a dove, the idea of "fleeing" like the wind and causing a storm, the attitude of the sailors, the presence of a sea-monster or dragon threatening the hero or swallowing him, and the form and the word used for the "gourd" (kikayon).{{sfn|Hamel|2015|pages=1–20}} Hamel takes the view that it was the Hebrew author who reacted to and adapted this mythological material to communicate his own, quite different message.{{sfn|Hamel|2015|pages=18–20}}

'''Kathryn Bridges Harley Clancy''' (also known as '''Kate Clancy''') is an American [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] who specialises in [[reproductive health]]. She is Associate Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], in the Department of [[Anthropology]]. Her additional research and policy advocacy work focuses on [[sexual harassment]] in [[science]] and [[Academy|academia]].

== Fertility research ==
Clancy's [[fertility]] research focuses on menstruation and variability in [[Endometrium|endometrial]] function. Clancy's early published research demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, menstruation does not increase risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Instead, Clancy and colleagues show that a thicker endometrium is associated with greater iron reserves amongst healthy women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nenko|first2=Ilona|last3=Jasienska|first3=Grazyna|date=September 2006|title=Menstruation does not cause anemia: endometrial thickness correlates positively with erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=710–713|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20538|issn=1042-0533|pmid=16917885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy's later studies focus on rural Polish populations. Clancy explores potential variation amongst endometrial function, or the functions of the inner mucous membrane layer of the [[uterus]]. Her research finds that endometrial thickness is negatively correlated over the latter phase of the menstrual cycle (the [[luteal phase]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2007-09-01|title=Unexpected luteal endometrial decline in a healthy rural Polish population|url=http://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115(06)00461-1/fulltext|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|language=English|volume=134|issue=1|pages=133–134|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2006.07.041|issn=0301-2115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's research contributes to understandings of fertility variation amongst normal, premenopausal Western women. For example, Swedish women appear to show an increase in endometrial thickness in the early part of the luteal phase, while for Canadian and English women, patterns appear largely stable at similar times. Canadian and Swedish women's endometrial thickness drops at other times, and while for Scottish sample, there is an increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CLANCY|first=KATHRYN B.H.|last2=ELLISON|first2=PETER T.|last3=JASIENSKA|first3=GRAZYNA|last4=BRIBIESCAS|first4=RICHARD G.|date=2009|title=Endometrial thickness is not independent of luteal phase day in a rural Polish population|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/117/3/117_090130/_html|journal=Anthropological Science|language=en|volume=117|issue=3|pages=157–163|doi=10.1537/ase.090130|issn=0918-7960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy and colleagues' research suggests that endometrial thickness should be measured daily to better capture and study this variation.

Clancy has also made a broader contribution to the study of human evolutionary biology and ecological stress on ovaries and endometrial function. She finds that immune stress and psychosocial stress impacts on the endometrium's ability to carry a fetus through the mechanism of inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2009-01-01|title=Reproductive ecology and the endometrium: Physiology, variation, and new directions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21188/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=140|issue=S49|pages=137–154|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21188|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's later research focuses on primate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461440598|title=Building Babies - Primate Development in Proximate and {{!}} Kathryn B.H.

== Sexual harassment research ==
Clancy is part of a team of [[anthropologist]]s who led the '''Survey of Academic Field Experiences''' study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nelson|first2=Robin G.|last3=Rutherford|first3=Julienne N.|last4=Hinde|first4=Katie|date=2014-07-16|title=Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[SAFE13 Study|SAFE13]]. The study, co-authored with Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, analysed experiences of sexual harassment and [[sexual assault]] in scientific fieldwork sites. The study found the majority of researchers had been exposed to, or experienced, sexual harassment, especially women and junior scientists.

A follow-up study (known as "'''SAFE 2'''"), led by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy identified systemic patterns that lead to negative fieldwork experiences and harassment. Field sites that have clear codes of conduct and consequences for behaviour are less likely to lead to sexual harassment. Where problems arise, these sites deal with issues swiftly and consistently, leading to higher levels of perceived safety and equality. In fieldwork sites where clear rules and consequences do not exist or are ambiguous, leaders do not take action against harassment. This leads to ongoing alienation and professional retaliation.

The SAFE13 study and subsequent research and activities (media interviews, conferences and advocacy) have made significant impact on increasing awareness of institutional responses to sexual harassment, as well as policy reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2018, Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.

=== Racism and gender harassment ===
In 2017, Clancy led another study on sexual harassment in collaboration with Katharine M. N. Lee, Erica M. Rodgers and Christina Richey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Lee|first2=Katharine M. N.|last3=Rodgers|first3=Erica M.|last4=Richey|first4=Christina|date=2017-07-01|title=Double jeopardy in astronomy and planetary science: Women of color face greater risks of gendered and racial harassment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JE005256/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets|language=en|volume=122|issue=7|pages=2017JE005256|doi=10.1002/2017JE005256|issn=2169-9100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research involved an online survey of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists. It is the first study of its kind in the physical sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lallensack|first=Rachael|date=2017-07-20|title=Female astronomers of colour face daunting discrimination|url=https://www.nature.com/news/female-astronomers-of-colour-face-daunting-discrimination-1.22291|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=547|issue=7663|pages=266–267|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the first large study to examine both gender and racial harassment in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/07/its-2017-and-women-of-colour-in-science-are-still-being-harassed/|title=It's 2017, And Women Of Colour In Science Are Still Being Harassed|date=2017-07-11|work=Gizmodo Australia|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study finds that 88% of participants had heard negative language at work, along with other verbal and physical abuse that made them feel unsafe. Women of colour, however, experienced the greatest level of hostility due to their race and gender. They experienced greater incidents of gendered and racialised harassment and were more attuned to noticing other forms of harassment such as homophobia. Forty percent of women of colour feel unsafe at work due to their gender or sex, and 28% due to their race. Women of colour are also more likely to skip educational and professional opportunities, such as meetings and conferences, in an attempt to minimise exposure to hostility and harassment.

The study received wide media coverage, as it provided evidence on how harassment limits women's career outcomes, especially for racial minority women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/11/women-of-color-face-staggering-harassment-in-space-science/|title=Women of color face staggering harassment in space science|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy also noted that the study unearths how survivors are re-traumatised by existing reporting systems that have no intermediary level of support in between staying silent and launching a formal report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study has been commended for showing how racial discrimination compounds experiences of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/07/14/women-color-stem-face-greater-risks-gender-racial-harassment-work/467501001/|title=Women of color in STEM face greater risks of gender, racial harassment at work|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shows that the impact of harassment contributes to a higher loss of women of colour in science relative to White women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/unsafe-science|title=Many Women Of Color Feel Unsafe Working In Science, New Study Finds|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study raises questions about [[Bystander effect|bystander interventions]], given the hostile culture towards women of colour is evident to witnesses, who do not feel empowered to act.

'''Legalism''' (or nomism), in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], is the act of putting the [[Law of Moses]] above the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, by establishing requirements for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] beyond [[Sola fide|faith]] (trust) in [[Jesus Christ]], specifically, trust in His finished work - the shedding of His blood for our sins, and reducing the broad, inclusive, and general precepts of the [[Bible]] to narrow and rigid [[Morality|moral]] codes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Reid et al., Dictionary of Christianity in America (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, [[superficiality]], the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the [[divine grace|grace of God]] or [[Letter and spirit of the law|emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit]]. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not [[Faith in Christianity|faith in God's grace]], is the pre-eminent principle of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. On the viewpoint that redemption is not earned by works, but that obedient faith is required to enter and remain in the redeemed state, see [[covenantal nomism]].

==In the New Testament==
The words 'legalism' or 'legalist' do not occur in the Old or New Testaments.  Legalism's root word, "law" (Greek ''nomos''), occurs frequently in the [[New Testament]], and sometimes is interpreted as legalism.  In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in {{bibleverse||Gal.|2:16}}, "''nomou'' is here evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting [[divine law]] viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ernest De Witt, ''The International Critical Commentary, Galatians'', 1921, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] day lacked any term corresponding to the distinct position of "legalism", "legalist", or "legalistic", leading [[C.E.B. Cranfield]] to commend "the possibility that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Pauline statements which at first sight seem to disparage the law]], were really directed not against the law itself but against that misunderstanding and misuse of it for which we now have a convenient terminology" (legalism).&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, C.E.B., ''The International Critical Commentary, Romans'', 1979, p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Messianic Jew]]ish Bible translator [[David H. Stern]] cited these two scholars to support the translation framework that often "&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''nomos''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; means 'legalism' and not God's ''[[Torah]]''", especially in Paul's constructs ''erga nomou'' (literally [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|"works of law"]], rendered by Stern "legalistic observance of ''Torah'' commands") and ''upo nomon'' (literally "under law", rendered by Stern by 13 words, "in subjection to the system which results from perverting the ''Torah'' into legalism").&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H., ''Jewish New Testament Commentary'', 1992, pp. 535–8, 552–3, on Gal. 2:16b, 3:23b.&lt;/ref&gt;

One concept of legalism, the belief that salvation can be earned by obedience to laws, is referred to in various New Testament books, including Galatians. In this case, some [[Jewish Christians|Jews who had become Christians]] believed that in order to obtain salvation, both faith in Christ (as [[Messiah]]), and obedience to the Mosiac laws were required, such as the cases of the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy]] and the [[Incident at Antioch]]. Generally, however, these cases are referred to as the [[Judaizer]] controversy, rather than a legalism controversy, but the two are related.

Legalism refers to any doctrine which states salvation comes strictly from adherence to the law.  It can be thought of as a works-based religion.  Groups in the New Testament said to be falling into this category include the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Scribes]], [[Judaizers]], and [[Nicolaitans]].  They are legalists because they emphasized obeying the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]], in the case of the Pharisees and Scribes, to the letter without understanding the concept of grace.  Jesus condemned their legalism in [[Woes of the Pharisees|Matthew 23]].  The Pharisees love of the praises of men for their strict adherence is said to be a prime example of legalism.

Legalism is sometimes confused with obedience.  New Testament books such as Romans, speak of grace and obedience together. An example is found in Romans 1:5 (New American Standard Version) speaking of Christ 'through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake...' The goal of receiving the grace was to bring about obedience of faith. Here grace, faith and obedience are tied together. Other references are in Acts 5:29, 32; Romans 16:19; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Hebrews 5:9.

Legalism is also confused with discipline, which is often spoken of in a positive light.  See 1 Corinthians 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 1:7 and Hebrews 12:5–11.

A third common misunderstanding of legalism is the word law.  Law in many places in the Bible refers to the Law of Moses, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].  In Galatians the Judaizers were trying to insist that salvation required that a person be circumcised prior to obeying the [[Law of Christ]].  Galatians 2:16 says,  "Knowing that a man is not justified by the [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|works of the law]], but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified" (King James Version).  The faith here is the [[Law of Christ]] and the law here is the Law of Moses.  The legalism of the Judaizers was that obedience to  the law of Moses was necessary to be saved.

Legalism in the New Testament is believed by some as being revealed by the life of Saul prior to his [[Conversion of Paul|conversion]].  Some believe that Saul sought to redeem himself by his works of persecution of the church and its ultimate destruction.  Acts 26:9–11 reveals, "I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to [[blaspheme]]; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities" (King James Version). Galatians 1:13–14 states, "For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly [[Zealots#Paul the Apostle|zealous]] of the traditions of my fathers" (King James Version).  These two texts emphasize the nature of Saul's religion, works.

However, in this passage the obedience is not tied to the obeying of specific Old Testament laws, such as keeping [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] or circumcision.

[[Image:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Icon of [[James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the [[Apostolic Decree]] of {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19–29}}, c. AD 50.]]

At the [[Council of Jerusalem]], c. 50, [[James the Just]] decreed the ''Apostolic Decree'':
: "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the [[Gentiles]] are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from [[idolatry|pollutions of idols]], and [from] [[fornication]], and [from] things strangled, and [from] [[Taboo food#Blood|blood]].{{ref|4}} For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the [[synagogues]] every [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] day" ({{bibleref|Acts|15:19–21|KJV}}).

Though the ''Apostolic Decree'' is no longer observed by many [[Christian denominations]] today, it is still observed in full by the [[Greek Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a very effective philosophy during that time.

== In intra-Christian relations ==

===Roman Catholic Church===
In [[Roman Catholicism]], [[good works]] are done in service to God and one's neighbour, by faith working through love.  In contrast, a severity in the imposition of, or overly scrupulous conformity to any rule of piety, may be charged with legalism.

In an attempt to resolve the dispute over legalism, the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] was a document issued in 1999 by Lutheran-Catholic clerical representatives, declaring a common belief in ''[[Sola gratia]]'', that grace alone can save the faithful, and that there is a ''progressive infusion'' of grace in the spirit of the believer.

===Eastern Orthodox Churches===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], for another example, rejects the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]] as ''legalistic''.  The satisfaction theory states that mankind's [[Original Sin]] violated God's law, resulting in all men being born guilty: an idea prevalent in the writings of [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] of the [[Western Church]].  [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] formally developed the theory that the legal problem of guilt before the Law, required the legal solution of retribution, in order to achieve a just salvation. The solution was for God's son Jesus to willingly die on the [[Cross]] in place of humanity, thus allowing the legal penalty to be fully carried out, satisfying the justice of God, and thus clearing the way for mercy to be shown to sinners.  The Eastern Orthodox charge that this theory is too dependent upon Roman legal concepts of retribution and justice. [citation needed]

===Protestant Churches===
In [[Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Christian]] [[theology]], especially in popular versions of the same, the charge of legalism is an accusation of overzealous adherence to the word of the Bible (as law) in all things said, established or accomplished in a believer's life (cf. [[bibliolatry]]). In that context, to apply the criticism of legalism to a theological position or religious attitude implies that the accused has overturned the Gospel of [[salvation]] through [[faith]] and new life in Jesus Christ and has instead substituted some principle of personal works of strict adherence to the word, through action, thought, or speech for the unearned [[divine grace|grace]] of God.

===In history===

Throughout the [[history of Christianity]], certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the article/interview [http://www.puntoacroce.altervista.org/_Den/T1-Legalismo_Sh.htm "Il legalismo? Parliamone (Legalism? Let's talk about it)"], with the participation of Nicola Martella, Alessandro Ceralli, Silvano Creaco, ''et al.'' {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* [[Asceticism]], such as [[fasting]] and other forms of self-denial.
* The keeping of [[Christian Sabbath]], especially regarding prohibitions of various otherwise innocent activities on the day of worship.
* Various extra-biblical [[religious law|ordinances]] and customs that become associated not just with wisdom but with holiness, in the contemporary situation, such as prohibitions against [[theater]], [[movies]], [[dance|dancing]], [[rock music]], [[playing card]]s, [[interracial marriage]] or [[mixed bathing]].
* Total abstinence from alcohol (See also [[Christianity and alcohol]].)
* [[Ritualism]], a superficial or superstitious use of customary [[prayer]]s and [[liturgy]].
* Similarly, certain exclusive [[ritual]] practices, such as rigorous insistence on the [[tetragrammaton]] as the only name by which God is honored, dietary laws, [[Saturday Sabbath]], or [[Passover (Christian holiday)]], especially when practicing these rituals is held necessary for salvation.
* [[Sacrament]]s, especially when the underlying theology allegedly views them as communicating God's grace automatically (compare [[ex opere operato]]).
* Various rigorous and restrictive beliefs, such as that, [[King-James-Only Movement|only the King James Version]] of the Bible constitutes God's word.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', [https://books.google.com/books/about/One_Bible_Only.html?id=uQWTxDdIO6IC&amp;redir_esc=y Beacham, Roy E.; Kevin T. Bauder, ''One Bible Only? Examining Exclusive Claims for the King James Bible'', Kregel Publications, 2001].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The belief that Christian families should [[homeschooling|homeschool]].
* The belief that women should never wear pants or shorts.
* [[Iconoclasm]]
* [[Tithing]]
* [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]]
* [[Puritan]]ism
* [[Judaizing]]
* [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]]
* [[Christian Reconstructionism]], which is based on the belief that Christians should still obey and enforce the full Mosaic law.

Several underlying dynamics appear in these controversies.  The permitted scope of [[veneration]] of material objects versus claims that such veneration is [[idolatry]], affects the perceived sanctity of ritual spaces and objects, and therefore of the rituals and customs themselves. Teachings about the authority of the church, the sources of legitimacy of that authority, and the role of [[clergy]] versus the [[priesthood of all believers]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Protestant Heritage" ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2007), [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109446 ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 20/09/2007]: "Protestantism originated in the 16th-century Reformation, and its basic doctrines, in addition to those of the ancient Christian creeds, are justification by grace alone through faith, the priesthood of all believers, and the supremacy of Holy Scripture in matters of faith and order."&lt;/ref&gt; also affect these debates.

'''Mock-heroic''', '''mock-epic''' or '''heroi-comic''' works are typically [[satire]]s or [[parodies]] that mock common Classical stereotypes of [[hero]]es and heroic literature.  Typically, mock-heroic works either put a fool in the role of the hero or exaggerate the heroic qualities to such a point that they become absurd.

==History==
Historically, the mock-heroic style was popular in 17th century Italy, and in the post-[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] periods in Great Britain.

The earliest example of the form is the ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' ascribed to [[Homer]] by the Romans and parodying his work, but believed by most modern scholars to be the work of an anonymous poet in the time of Alexander the Great &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carmentablog.com/2016/12/27/batrachomyomachia-classical-parody/|title=Batrachomyomachia: A Classical Parody - Carmenta Language School Blog|date=2016-12-27|work=Carmenta Language School Blog|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A longstanding assumption on the origin of the mock-heroic in the 17th century is that [[epic (genre)|epic]] and the [[pastoral]] genres had become used up and exhausted,&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p135"&gt;Griffin,Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA135 p.135]&lt;/ref&gt; and so they got parodically [[reprise]]d. In the 17th century the epic genre was heavily criticized, because it was felt expressing the traditional values of the feudal society.
Among the new genres, closer to the modern feelings and proposing new ideals, the satirical literature was particularly effective in criticizing the old habits and values. Beside the Spanish [[picaresque novel]]s and the French [[burlesque]] novel, in Italy flourished the ''poema eroicomico''. &lt;br&gt;
In this country those who still wrote epic poems, following the rules set by [[Torquato Tasso]] in his work ''Discorsi del poema eroico'' (''Discussions about the Epic Poems'') and realized in his masterwork, the ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', were felt as antiquated.&lt;br&gt;
The new mock-heroic poem accepted the same metre, vocabulary, rhetoric of the epics. However, the new genre turned the old epic upside down about the meaning, setting the stories in more familiar situations, to ridiculize the traditional epics. In this context was created the parody of epic genre.

''Lo scherno degli dèi'' (''The Mockery of Gods'') by [[Francesco Bracciolini]], printed in 1618 is often regarded as the first Italian ''poema eroicomico''.

[[File:Houghton MS Typ 619 - Amelonghi.jpg|thumb|Girolamo Amelonghi, 1547]]
However, the best known of the form is ''[[La secchia rapita]]'' (''The rape of the Bucket'') by [[Alessandro Tassoni]] (1622). &lt;br&gt;Other Italian mock-heroic poems were ''La Gigantea'' by [[Girolamo Amelonghi]] (1566), the ''Viaggio di Colonia'' (''Travel to Cologne'') by [[Antonio Abbondanti]] (1625), ''L'asino'' (''The donkey'') by [[Carlo de' Dottori]] (1652), ''La Troja rapita'' by [[Loreto Vittori]] (1662), ''Il malmantile racquistato'' by [[Lorenzo Lippi]] (1688), ''La presa di San Miniato'' by [[Ippolito Neri]] (1764).

Also in Italian dialects were written mock-heroic poems. For example, in [[Neapolitan dialect]] the best known work of the form was ''La Vaiasseide'' by [[Giulio Cesare Cortese]] (1612).&lt;br&gt; While in [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] [[Giovanni Camillo Peresio]] wrote ''Il maggio romanesco'' (1688), [[Giuseppe Berneri]] published ''[[Meo Patacca]]'' in 1695, and, finally, [[Benedetto Micheli]] printed ''La libbertà romana acquistata e defesa'' in 1765.

After the translation of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]], English authors began to imitate the inflated language of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]] poetry and narrative to describe misguided or common characters.  The most likely genesis for the mock-heroic, as distinct from the [[picaresque novel|picaresque]], [[burlesque (literature)|burlesque]], and [[satire|satirical]] poem is the comic poem ''[[Hudibras]]'' (1662–1674), by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]].  Butler's poem describes a "trew blew" Puritan knight during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], in language that imitates Romance and [[epic poetry]].  After Butler, there was an explosion of poetry that described a despised subject in the elevated language of heroic poetry and plays.  

''Hudibras'' gave rise to a particular verse form, commonly called the "[[Hudibrastic]]."  The Hudibrastic is poetry in closed rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter, where the rhymes are often [[feminine rhyme]]s or unexpected conjunctions.  For example, Butler describes the [[English Civil War]] as a time which "Made men fight like mad or drunk/ For dame religion as for punk/ Whose honesty all durst swear for/ Tho' not one knew why or wherefore" ("punk" meaning a prostitute).  The strained and unexpected rhymes increase the comic effect and heighten the parody.  This formal indication of satire proved to separate one form of mock-heroic from the others.  After Butler, [[Jonathan Swift]] is the most notable practitioner of the Hudibrastic, as he used that form for almost all of his poetry.

[[Poet Laureate]] [[John Dryden]] is responsible for some of the dominance among satirical genres of the mock-heroic in the later Restoration era.  While Dryden's own plays would themselves furnish later mock-heroics (specifically, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' is satirized in the mock-heroic ''[[The Author's Farce]]'' and ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''), Dryden's ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' is perhaps the ''[[locus classicus]]'' of the mock-heroic form as it would be practiced for a century to come.  In that poem, Dryden indirectly compares [[Thomas Shadwell]] with [[Aeneas]] by using the language of ''[[Aeneid]]'' to describe the coronation of Shadwell on the throne of Dullness formerly held by King Flecknoe.  The [[parody]] of Virgil satirizes Shadwell.  Dryden's prosody is identical to regular [[heroic verse]]:  iambic pentameter closed couplets.  The parody is not formal, but merely contextual and ironic. (For an excellent overview of the history of the mock-heroic in the 17th and 18th centuries see "the English Mock-Heroic poem of the 18th Century" by Grazyna Bystydzienska, published by Polish Scientific Publishers, 1982.) 

After Dryden, the form continued to flourish, and there are countless minor mock-heroic poems from 1680 to 1780.  Additionally, there were a few attempts at a mock-heroic novel.  The most significant later mock-heroic poems were by [[Alexander Pope]].  Pope’s ''The Rape of the Lock'' is a noted example of the Mock-Heroic style; indeed, Pope never deviates from mimicking [[epic poetry]] such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' .   The overall form of the poem, written in [[canto]]s, follows the tradition of epics, along with the precursory “Invocation of the [[Muse]]”; in this case, Pope's [[Muse]] is literally the person who prodded him to write the poem, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]]: “this verse to Caryll, Muse, is due!” (line 3).  Epics always include foreshadowing which is usually given by an otherworldly figure{{fact|date=November 2013 }}, and Pope mocks tradition through Ariel the sprite, who sees some “dread event” (line 109) impending on Belinda.  These epic introductory tendencies give way to the main portion of the story, usually involving a battle of some kind (such as in the ''Iliad'') that follows this pattern: dressing for battle (description of Achilles shield, preparation for battle), altar sacrifice/libation to the gods, some battle change (perhaps involving drugs), treachery (Achilles ankle is told to be his weak spot), a journey to the Underworld, and the final battle.  All of these elements are followed eloquently by Pope in that specific order: Belinda readies herself for the card game (which includes a description of her hair and beauty), the Baron makes a sacrifice for her hair (the altar built for love and the deal with Clarissa), the “mock” battle of cards changes in the Baron’s favor, Clarissa’s treachery to her supposed friend Belinda by slipping the Baron scissors, and finally the treatment of the card game as a battle and the Baron’s victory.  Pope’s [http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/rapeofthelock/analysis.html mastery of the Mock-Heroic] is clear in every instance.  Even the typical [[apotheosis]] found in the epics is mimicked in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', as “the stars inscribe Belinda’s name!” (line 150). He invokes the same Mock-heroic style in ''[[The Dunciad]]'' which also employs the language of heroic poetry to describe menial or trivial subjects.    In this mock-epic the progress of [[Dulness]] over the face of the earth, the coming of stupidity and tastelessness, is treated in the same way as the coming of civilization is in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (see also the metaphor of ''[[translatio studii]]'').  [[John Gay]]'s ''[[Trivia (poem)|Trivia]]'' and ''[[Beggar's Opera]]'' were mock-heroic (the latter in [[opera]]), and [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[London (Samuel Johnson poem)|London]]'' is a mock-heroic of a sort.

By the time of Pope, however, the mock-heroic was giving ground to narrative [[parody]], and authors such as Fielding led the mock-heroic novel into a more general novel of parody.  The ascension of the novel drew a slow end to the age of the mock-heroic, which had originated in Cervantes's novel.  After [[Romanticism]]'s flourishing, mock-heroics like Byron's ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' were uncommon.

Finally, the mock-heroic genre spread throughout Europe, in [[France]], in [[Scotland]], in [[Poland]], in [[Bohemia]], in [[Russia]]. The most noted mock-heroic poems in French were ''Le Vergile Travesti'' (''The disguised Vergil'') by [[Paul Scarron]] (1648–52) and ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' by [[Voltaire]] (1730). In [[macaronic Latin]] enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] wrote ''Polemo-Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam'' in 1684. The main author of mock-heroic poems in Polish was [[Ignacy Krasicki]], who wrote ''Myszeida'' (''Mouseiad'') in 1775 and ''Monacomachia'' (''The War of the Monks'') in 1778. In the same language [[Tomasz Kajetan Węgierski]] published ''Organy'' in 1775-77. The Bohemian poet [[Šebestiàn Hnĕvkovský]] in 1805 printed two mock-heroic poems: ''Dĕvin'' in Czech and ''Der böhmische Mägderkrieg'' in German. In 1791 the Russian poet [[N. P. Osipov]] published {{Interlanguage link multi|Eneida travestied|ru|3=Вергилиева Энеида, вывороченная наизнанку|lt=''Eneida travestied''}} ({{lang-ru|Вирги́лиева Энеи́да, вы́вороченная наизна́нку|italic=yes}}). [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]'s mock-epic poem Eneyida (Ukrainian: Енеїда), written in 1798, is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the [[modern Ukrainian language]].

[[Image:Alpine valley.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine valley, like Oldest Dryas]]
The '''Oldest Dryas''' was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest [[stadial]] after the [[Weichselian]] glaciation in north Europe. In the [[Alps]], the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the [[Gschnitz]] stadial of the [[Würm glaciation]]. The three “Dryas” periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', detected in [[core sample]]s of glacial ice and [[peat bog]]s. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to [[pollen zone]] Ia.

[[Image:Greenland Kangerlussuaq icesheet.jpg|thumb|right|The edge of the ice in Greenland]]
The period was between 16,050-13,050 [[Before Christ|BC]], from Roberts, 1998. A date from [[Kilkeel]], [[Northern Ireland]], extends the start of the period to as early as 17,050 BC. A strong sequence of carbon-14 dates derived from layered material in the Hauterive/Rouges-Terres excavations on the northwest shore of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]], 1992–1993, places the end of the Oldest Dryas at about 12,700 BC, calibrated. The same date from [[Antarctica]] and the south China sea is 14,600 and 14,700, respectively, and a [[Greenland]] ice core indicates 14,500. David Miles refers to the Oldest Dryas as the last [[Heinrich event]] (H1) and dates it to between 16,500 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David  |last=Miles  |title=The Tale of the Axe: How the Neolithic Revolution Transformed Britain |authorlink= |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|location = London, UK |year=2016 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-500-05186-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate standard to which all these dates are to be compared is the graph of the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s, which gives change in isotope concentration on the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. The graph plots many events that are sharply defined, but others are not. The selection of a terminal point is sometimes partially arbitrary.

The end of the Oldest Dryas is sharply defined. The beginning is a long, gently sloping band, probably no earlier than 17,050 BC, but the date might be set later by approximately 1000 years. Data derived from isotope variation of [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] trapped in [[Greenland]] ice gives a high-resolution date for the end of the oldest Dryas at the sharp temperature rise of 14.67 ky BP.

[[Image:Lac de Neuchatel depuis la Neuchatel (ville suisse) dscn0660.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Neuchatel]]
The complete sequence of late [[Pleistocene]] climatic periods, defined for [[Northern Europe]], are the Oldest Dryas (stadial), the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bölling]] (interstadial), the [[Older Dryas]] (stadial), the [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] (interstadial), and the [[Younger Dryas]] (stadial). The [[Holocene]] begins immediately afterward. The last three are also [[Blytt-Sernander]] periods.

Sometimes, the Older Dryas is missing, as in the [[Jura Mountains]] of [[France]], or it is negligible in the evidence. In that case, the initial part of the sequence appears to be Oldest Dryas (cold), Bølling-Allerød (warm), Younger Dryas (cold). The Bølling-Allerød corresponds to the [[Windermere]] interstadial in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Often, however, the apparently-missing Older Dryas is a problem of resolution in the evidence. Some scientists have undertaken high-resolution studies, which combine a variety of climatological methods. They, like the ones conducted on [[Owens Lake|Owens]] and [[Mono Lake|Mono]] Lakes, in [[California]], usually detect the Older Dryas. Even when it is detected, it appears to be no more than a few centuries of slightly-cooler weather on the oxygen isotope ratio graph.

==Flora==
During the Oldest Dryas, Europe was treeless and similar to the Arctic [[tundra]], but much drier and grassier than the modern tundra. It contained shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the following:
:*[[Poaceae]], grasses
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]''
:*''[[Dwarf Birch|Betula nana]]'', dwarf birch
:*''[[Dwarf Willow|Salix retusa]]'', dwarf willow
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]''
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|Grassland ([[Inner Mongolia]])
Image:Artemisia_vulgaris_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-016.jpg|''Artemisia vulgaris''
Image:Betula nana0.jpg|''Betula nana''
Image:Mountainavens2.jpg|''Dryas octopetala''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
Species were mainly Arctic but during the Glacial Maximum, the warmer weather species had withdrawn into refugia and began to repopulate Europe in the Oldest Dryas.

The brown bear, ''[[Brown bear|Ursos arctos]]'', was among the first to arrive in the north. Genetic studies indicate North European brown bears came from a refugium in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] of [[Moldavia]]. Other refugia were in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]].

The bears would not have returned north except in pursuit of food. The tundra must already have been well populated. It is likely that the species hunted by humans at [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]] by the end of the period were present during it. Here are other animals present:

[[Aves]]
:*''[[Black-throated diver|Gavia arctica]]'', black-throated diver
:*''[[Black-necked grebe|Podiceps nigricollis]]'', black-necked grebe
:*''[[Whooper swan|Cygnus cygnus]]'', whooper swan
:*''[[Golden eagle|Aquila chrysaetos]]'', golden eagle
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Gavia arctica1.jpg|''Gavia arctica''
Image:Podiceps nigricollis naumann.jpg|''Podiceps nigricollis''
Image:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|''Cygnus cygnus''
Image:Aquila chrysaetos large drawing.jpg|''Aquila chrysaetos''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The above birds are primarily maritime. They must have fed in the copious glacial waters of the north that were just beginning to be released.

[[Fish]]
:*''[[Burbot|Lota lota]]'', burbot
:*''[[Grayling (species)|Thymallus thymallus]]'', grayling
:*''[[Common Roach|Rutilus rutilus]]'', roach
:*''[[Trout|Salmo trutta]]'', trout
:*''[[Salvelinus]] alpinus'', char
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tarfala.jpg|Glacial stream
Image:Trüsche Walchensee.jpg|''Lota lota''
Image:Bachforelle Zeichnung.jpg|''Salmo trutta''
Image:Röding, Iduns kokbok.jpg|''Salvelinus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The smaller mammals of the food chain inhabited the herbaceous blanket of the tundra:

[[Cricetidae]]
:*''[[Lemming|Discrotonyx torquatus]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Vole|Microtus oeconomus]]'', root vole
:*''[[Vole|Microtus arvalis]]'', common vole
:*''[[Vole|Chionmys nivalis]]'', snowy vole

[[Leporidae]]
:*''[[Mountain hare|Lepus timidus]]'', Arctic hare

[[Sciuridae]]
:*''[[Marmot|Marmota marmota]]'', marmot

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:TundraVole23.jpg|''Microtus oeconomus''
Image:Feldmaus Microtus arvalis.jpg|''Microtus arvalis''
Image:Arctic Hare.jpg|''Lepus timidus''
Image:Marmota marmota Alpes1.jpg|''Marmota marmota''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to bears and birds were other predators of the following small animals:

[[Carnivora]]
:*''[[Lynx|Felis lynx]]'', lynx
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', Arctic fox
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', wolf

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|Lynx (or Felis) lynx
Image:Alopex lagopus standing on Nizke Island.jpg|''Alopex lagopus''
Image:Canis lupus portrait.jpg|''Canis lupus''
Image:IcelandicHorseInWinter.jpg|Icelandic horse, perhaps like ''Equus ferus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Humans were interested in the large mammals, which included:
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', reindeer
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', wild horse
:*''[[Ibex|Capra ibex]]'', ibex

At some point, the larger mammals arrived: [[hyena]], [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[cave bear]] and [[mammoth]].
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Albino raindeer.jpg|Rangifer tarandus
Image:CapraIbex-1.jpg|Capra ibex
Image:Wooly rhinoceros.jpg|Woolly rhinoceros
Image:Mammouth.png|Mammoth
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Human prehistory==
[[Image:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|right|Jōmon pottery]]
Human cultures in Europe were Upper [[Palaeolithic]] and belonged to [[Cro-Magnon]] man. [[Neanderthal]]s had long since disappeared by replacement or amalgamation with ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The [[Magdalenian]] culture of reindeer hunters prevailed in Western Europe. From the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] eastward, the Epigravettian continued the prior [[Gravettian]]. In Japan, the [[Jōmon]] culture had already become sedentary and was producing some food, and possibly grew rice, but it was not at all urban. It was manufacturing the first known pottery.

One of the most remarkable discoveries of the period was the domestic wolf, a distinct breed of ''[[Canis lupus]]'', with smaller teeth. The domestic dog, ''[[Canis familiaris]]'', also has been found. It is thought that the animals helped with the hunting, but they would, by the nature of the hunt, have gradually become adept at herding.

'''Orientalism''' is a term used by art historians and literary and [[cultural studies]] scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in [[Eastern world|West Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian cultures]]. These depictions are usually done by writers, designers, and artists from the West. In particular, '''Orientalist painting''', depicting more specifically "the [[Middle East]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century [[academic art]], and the literature of Western countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.

Since the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term "Orientalism" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West [[Essentialism|essentializes]] these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Mamdani, ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terrorism'', New York: Pantheon, 2004; {{ISBN|0-375-42285-4}}; p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Orientalism refers to the [[Orient]], in reference and opposition to the [[Occident]]; the East and the West, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''Oriens'', ''Oxford English Dictionary''. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The word Orient entered the English language as the [[Middle French]] ''orient''. The root word ''oriēns'', from the Latin ''Oriēns'', has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography. In the "[[Monk's Tale]]" (1375), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] wrote: "That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee." The term "orient" refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. ''In Place of Fear'' (1952), [[Aneurin Bevan]] used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended [[East Asia]]: "the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas". Edward Said said that Orientalism "enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present."&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 357&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In art history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in [[Western Asia]], during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term "Orientalist" was made popular by the art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]].&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such social disdain for a style of [[Representation (arts)|representational art]], the [[Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français|French Society of Orientalist Painters]] was founded in 1893, with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] as the honorary president;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 74&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified "an artist".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, R., ''Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880-1930,'' 2003, pp 57 -78&lt;/ref&gt; As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century [[academic art]]; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed and those who imagined Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Volait, "Middle Eastern collections of Orientalist Painting at the Turn of the 21st century: Paradoxical reversal or persistent misunderstanding?; François Pouillon and Jean-Claude Vatin, ''After Orientalism: Critical perspectives on Western Agency and Eastern Reappropriations," ''Leiden Studies in Islam and Society,'' pp 251-271, 2014, Online: &lt;http://www.brill.com/products/book/after-orientalism&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; French painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com, https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-general/orientalism&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental studies===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the [[Eastern world]]. Among such scholars were British officials of the [[East India Company]], who said that the [[Arab culture]], the [[culture of India]], and the [[Islamic culture]]s should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Macfie |first = A. L.|year = 2002 |title = Orientalism |publisher = Longman| location = London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FrJAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn = 0582423864|ref = none| p = Ch One}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among such scholars is the philologist [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], whose studies of [[Indo-European languages]] established modern [[philology]]. British [[Company rule in India|imperial strategy in India]] favored Orientalism as a technique for developing good relations with the natives—until the 1820s, when the influence of "anglicists" such as [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] led to the promotion of Anglocentric education.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway (2006), pp. 1–2. "The Orientalism espoused by Warren Hastings, William Jones and the early East India Company sought to maintain British domination over the Indian subcontinent through patronage of Hindu and Muslim languages and institutions, rather than through their eclipse by English speech and aggressive European acculturation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Hebraists|Hebraism]] and [[Jewish studies]] gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08624.html|title=Hebraists, Christian|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic field of [[Oriental studies]], which comprehended the cultures of the [[Near East]] and the [[Far East]], became the fields of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]].

===Critical studies===
In the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), the cultural critic Edward Said redefined the term Orientalism to describe a pervasive Western tradition — academic and artistic — of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis of ''Orientalism'' develops [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s theory of [[cultural hegemony]], and [[Michel Foucault]]'s theorisation of [[discourse]] (the [[knowledge]]-and-[[Power (social and political)|power]] relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of [[Arab]]o-Islamic cultures, especially [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Fouad Ajami]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) Preface, 2003 ed. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of IslamicJerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=24–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analyses are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse [[visual art]] and [[Orientalist painting]]. In that vein, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] applied Said's methods of critical analysis to art, "with uneven results".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6, 11 (quoted), 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[academy]], the book ''Orientalism'' (1978) became a foundational text of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of Islamic Jerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in relation to the cultural institution of [[citizenship]], Orientalism has rendered the concept of ''citizenship'' as a problem of [[epistemology]], because citizenship originated as a social institution of the Western world; as such, the problem of defining citizenship reconfigures the idea of ''Europe'' in time of crises.&lt;ref&gt;Mura, Andrea, (2015) "[https://www.academia.edu/21512966/Dis-orienting_Austerity_The_Indebted_Citizen_as_the_New_Soul_of_Europe Disorienting Austerity: The Indebted Citizen as the New Soul of Europe]" In Engin Isin (ed.), ''Citizenship After Orientalism: Transforming Political Theory''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Said said that Orientalism, as an "idea of representation is a theoretical one: The Orient is a stage on which the whole East is confined" in order to make the Eastern world "less fearsome to the West";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 363&lt;/ref&gt; that the developing world, primarily the West, is the cause of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Edward|title=Orientalism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JncXpQQoZAo|date=April 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in ''Empire: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000), Stephen Howe agreed with Said that Western nations and their empires were created by the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, by the extraction of wealth and labour from one country to another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire:A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University press|pages=73–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In European architecture and design==
{{Further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
The [[Moresque]] style of [[Renaissance]] [[ornament (art)|ornament]] is a European adaptation of the Islamic [[arabesque]] that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as [[bookbinding]], until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]]. One of the earliest examples is the façade of [[Guildhall, London]] (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by [[William Hodges]], and [[William Daniell|William]] and [[Thomas Daniell]] from about 1795. Examples of "Hindoo" architecture are [[Sezincote House]] (c. 1805) in [[Gloucestershire]], built for a [[nabob]] returned from [[Bengal]], and the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]].

''[[Turquerie]]'', which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of "Turkish" styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the [[Ottoman Empire]] itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.

''[[Chinoiserie]]'' is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially [[Rococo]] Chinoiserie, ''c.'' 1740–1770. From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the [[East India Company]]), Denmark (the [[Danish East India Company]]), the Netherlands (the [[Dutch East India Company]]) and France (the [[French East India Company]]). Tin-glazed pottery made at [[Delft]] and other Dutch towns adopted genuine [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era [[blue and white porcelain]] from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at [[Meissen]] and other centers of true [[porcelain]] imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and [[teaware]]s (see [[Chinese export porcelain]]).

Pleasure pavilions in "Chinese taste" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at [[Aranjuez]] near [[Madrid]]. [[Thomas Chippendale]]'s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, ''c.'' 1753–70. Sober ''homages'' to early Xing scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the ''tang'' evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream "chinoiserie". Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small [[pagoda]]s appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. [[Kew]] has a magnificent garden pagoda designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. The [[Wilhelma]] (1846) in [[Stuttgart]] is an example of [[Moorish Revival architecture]]. [[Leighton House Museum|Leighton House]], built for the artist [[Frederic Leighton]], has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.

After 1860, ''[[Japonism]],'' sparked by the importing of [[ukiyo-e]], became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as [[Claude Monet]] and [[Edgar Degas]] were influenced by the Japanese style. [[Mary Cassatt]], an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Ives&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s ''[[The Peacock Room]]'' demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects [[Greene and Greene]] were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and other buildings.

[[Egyptian Revival architecture]] became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. [[Moorish Revival architecture]] began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]] was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the [[British Raj]].

==Orientalist art==
===Pre-19th century===
[[File:Gentile Bellini Madonna and Child Enthroned late 15th century.jpg|thumb|A "Bellini type" [[Islamic]] [[prayer rug]], seen from the top, at the feet of the [[Virgin Mary]], in [[Gentile Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child Enthroned'', late 15th century]]
Depictions of Islamic "[[Moors]]" and "Turks" (imprecisely named [[Muslim]] groups of [[southern Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]]) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the [[Near East]]. The [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] in [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scenes]] were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by [[Gentile Bellini]] and others, and a number of 19th century works. Renaissance [[Venice]] had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in painting and [[old master print|prints]]. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to [[Constantinople]] and painted the Sultan, and [[Vittore Carpaccio]] were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Étienne Liotard]] (1702–1789) visited [[Istanbul]] and painted numerous [[pastel]]s of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in [[history painting]] by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge ''James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like [[toga]]s. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including [[Lord Byron]], as did many who had never left Europe, including [[Madame de Pompadour]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Riding, ''Travellers and Sitters: The Orientalist Portrait'', in Tromans, 48–75&lt;/ref&gt; The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France's own [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref name="McCabe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnS6lVLapI4C&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=15 July 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of [[Romanticism]] in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.

===French Orientalism===
[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|240px|''The 1798 Egyptian Expedition Under the Command of Bonaparte'', [[Léon Cogniet]], 1835. [[Musée du Louvre]]]]
[[File:Ferdinand-Victor-Eugène Delacroix, French - The Death of Sardanapalus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1827]]
French Orientalist painting was transformed by [[Napoleon]]'s ultimately unsuccessful [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt and Syria]] in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in [[Egyptology]], and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon's court painters, especially [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804) and ''[[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]]'' (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective ''Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids'' (1810). [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]'s ''La Révolte du Caire'' (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated ''Description de l'Égypte'' was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on [[antiquities]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s first great success, ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. [[Greece]] was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with ''[[Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi]]'' (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and ''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', inspired by [[Lord Byron]], which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 294–296; Tromans, 128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now [[Algeria]], recently conquered by the French, and [[Morocco]], as part of a diplomatic mission to the [[Sultan of Morocco]]. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured [[Jews]] or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women's' quarters or [[harem]] of a house to sketch what became ''[[Women of Algiers]]''; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|240px|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862]]
When Ingres, the director of the French ''Académie de peinture'', painted a highly colored vision of a ''[[Turkish bath]]'', he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient.&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"&gt;Tromans, 135&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in [[Henri Matisse]]'s orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres' pupil [[Théodore Chassériau]] (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude ''[[The Toilette of Esther]]'' (1841, [[Louvre]]) and equestrian portrait of ''Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort'' (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the [[steamship]] made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.

In many of these works, they portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say [[stereotype]]d. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging [[odalisque]]s. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in [[genre painting]], have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for "the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode";&lt;ref&gt;Tromans. 136&lt;/ref&gt; (''Gallery, below'')

===British Orientalism===
[[File:William Holman Hunt 002.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'', 1854–61]]
Though British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for naked women. The leading British [[genre painter]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] was 55 when he travelled to [[Istanbul]] and [[Jerusalem]] in 1840, dying off [[Gibraltar]] during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a [[Protestant]] agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: "a [[Martin Luther]] in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered", by which he meant traditional Christian [[iconography]]. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] had similar motivations,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 14 (quoted), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 289, disputing Rosenthal assertion, and insisting that "there must be some attempt to clarify ''whose'' reality we are talking about".&lt;/ref&gt; The French artist [[James Tissot]] also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.

William Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1856), ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'' (1860), and ''[[The Shadow of Death]]'' (1871). ''[[The Miracle of the Holy Fire (painting)|The Miracle of the Holy Fire]]'' (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most English visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'' (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé's face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 16–17 and see index&lt;/ref&gt; This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.

When Gérôme exhibited ''For Sale; Slaves at Cairo'' at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1871, it was "widely found offensive", perhaps partly because the British liked to think they had successfully suppressed the [[slave trade]] in Egypt, also for cruelty and "representing fleshiness for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; But Rana Kabbani believes that "French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists"&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and "the iconography of the ''[[odalisque]]'' ... the Oriental [[sex slave]] whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin",&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt; though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other painters.

[[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in [[Cairo]], painted highly detailed works showing both realistic [[Genre painting|genre scenes]] of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He "never painted a nude", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, quote 135; 134 on his wife; generally: 22–32, 80–85, 130–135, and see index&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter [[Lord Leighton]], imagine "the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks".&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt;

Other artists concentrated on [[landscape painting]], often of desert scenes, including [[Richard Dadd]] and [[Edward Lear]]. [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of [[antiquities]], and published very successful books of [[lithograph]]s from them.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 102–125, covers landscape&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of [[Central Asia]] that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the [[Mongol]]s who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. [[Nationalist]] historical painting in [[Central Europe]] and the [[Balkans]] dwelt on Turkish oppression, with [[battle scene]]s and maidens about to be raped.

The Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 7, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and composers are not commonly referred to as "Orientalist" in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. [[Lord Byron]] with his four long "Turkish tales" in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of [[Romanticism]]. Verdi's opera ''Aida'' (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. "Aida" depicts a militaristic Egypt's tyranny over Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe's "backyard Orient".&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Joseph. "Irish Orientalism," New York: Syracuse University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
In music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the ''alla Turca'', used by multiple composers including [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 129&lt;/ref&gt; The American musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: "the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an "ambivalence" to the theme since "Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Taruskin characterizes Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies "full of close little ornaments and melismas",&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass&lt;ref name="taruskin165"&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;—characteristics which were used by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sergei Lyapunov|Lyapunov]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]. These musical characteristics evoke "not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of ''nega'', a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians. ... In opera and song, ''nega'' often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved."&lt;ref name="taruskin165" /&gt;

Orientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of [[exoticism]], including the ''[[japonisme]]'' in [[Claude Debussy]]'s piano music all the way to the [[sitar]] being used in recordings by [[the Beatles]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"/&gt;

===In literature===
The Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term "Romantic" references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things "foreign". Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and "native" personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romantic Orientalism: Overview|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/romantic/topic_4/welcome.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'', [[Gustave Flaubert]] used ancient [[Carthage]] in North Africa as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to ancient [[Rome]]. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient [[Semitic cultures]].

===In film===
Said argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the [[Cinema of the United States]], as the West has now grown to include the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] feature film, such as the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series, ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]]'' films, and Disney's ''[[Aladdin (franchise)|Aladdin]]'' film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.

The overly sexualized character of [[Princess Jasmine]] in ''Aladdin'' is simply a continuation of the paintings from the 19th century, where women were represented as erotic, sexualized male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Tea House of the August Moon]]'' (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film "tells us more about the Americans and the American's image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}} &lt;/ref&gt;The film characterizes the Okinawans as "merry but backward" and "de-politicized", which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.

Kimiko Akita, in "Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in Memoirs of a Geisha", argues that ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep "cultural misrepresentations". She states that ''Memoirs of a Geish]'' "reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic".

===In dance===
During the Romantic Period of the 19th century, [[ballet]] developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.

The Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. ''Le Corsaire'' premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by [[Joseph Mazilier]].&lt;ref name="abt corsaire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Corsaire|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/corsairefl.html|website=ABT|publisher=Ballet Theatre Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marius Petipa]] re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron's poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha's Palace, which features his harem of wives.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed ''La Bayadere'', the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa's play ''Sakuntala''.&lt;ref name=Au&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bayadere'' used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a 'Hindu Dance,' motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, ''Sheherazade'', choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah's wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; The ballet's controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; ''Sheherazade'' was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.

Several lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also reveal Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa's ''Pharaoh's Daughter'' (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Aspicia's costume consisted of 'Egyptian' décor on a tutu.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir's ''Brahma'', which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowitt|first1=Deborah|title=Time and the Dancing Image|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included ''Cleopatra'' in Ballet's Russe's repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine's ''Une Nuit d' Egypte'' combined the "exoticism and grandeur" that audiences of this time craved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

As one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, [[Ruth St Denis]] also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; She included ''Radha'' and ''The Cobras'' in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, ''The Nautch'' in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, ''Egypta''.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with ''Ishtar of the Seven Gates'' in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

While Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform ''Le Corsaire'', ''La Bayadere'', and ''Sheherazade''. Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of ''The Nutcracker'', such as the 2010 [[American Ballet Theatre]] production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical 'Oriental' movements and arm positions have developed and remain.

==Religion==
{{Spirituality sidebar|orientalist}}
An exchange of Western and Eastern ideas about spirituality developed as the West traded with and established colonies in Asia.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The first Western translation of a Sanskrit text appeared in 1785,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} marking the growing interest in Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} Translations of the ''Upanishads'', which [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] called "the consolation of my life", first appeared in 1801 and 1802.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177-178}}{{refn|group=note|Schopenhauer also called his poodle "Atman".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}} 19th-century [[transcendentalism]] was influenced by Asian spirituality, prompting [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882) to pioneer the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Leigh Eric. ''Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality''. San Francisco: Harper, 2005. {{ISBN|0-06-054566-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major force in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western [[spirituality]] and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]],{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} a group searching for ancient wisdom from the East and spreading Eastern religious ideas in the West.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} One of its salient features was the belief in "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|Masters of Wisdom]]",{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread Western ideas in the East, contributing to its modernisation and a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]].{{sfn|Sinari|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} Between 1878 and 1882, the Society and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} [[Helena Blavatsky]], along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H.

Another major influence was [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=189-193}}{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}} who popularised his modernised interpretation{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} of [[Advaita Vedanta]] during the later 19th and early 20th century in both India and the West,{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}} emphasising ''anubhava'' ("personal experience") over scriptural authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}}

The term "re-orientalism" was used by Lisa Lau and Ana Cristina Mendes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/886477672|title=Re-orientalism and South Asian identity politics : the oriental other within|last=editor.|first=Lau, Lisa, editor.

"Re-Orientalism differs from Orientalism in its manner of and reasons for referencing the West: while challenging the metanarratives of Orientalism, re-Orientalism sets up alternative metanarratives of its own in order to articulate eastern identities, simultaneously deconstructing and reinforcing Orientalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Lau|first2=Lisa|date=December 2014|title=India through re-Orientalist Lenses|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F1369801X.2014.984619|journal=Interventions|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=706–727|doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.984619|issn=1369-801X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Occidentalism]]" is often used to refer to negative views of the Western world found in Eastern societies and is founded on the sense of nationalism that spread in reaction to colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2006/v17/n2/016587ar.pdf |title = Edward Said: Orientalism and Occidentalism|last = Lary|first = Diana|date = 2006|journal = Journal of the Canadian Historical Association / Revue de la Société historique du Canada|volume = 17| number = 2 |p = 3–15|doi = 10.7202/016587ar|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of "[[othering]]" cultures occurs when groups are labeled as different due to characteristics that distinguish them from the perceived norm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = |journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Said]], the author of the book ''Orientalism'', argued that western powers and influential individuals such as social scientists and artists othered "the Orient".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The evolution of ideologies is often initially embedded in the language, and continues to ripple through the fabric of society by taking over the culture, economy and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Orientalism at Home: The Case of 'Canada's Toughest Neighbourhood'|last = Richardson|first = Chris|date = 2014|journal = Project Muse|volume = 27|pages = 75|doi = 10.3828/bjcs.2014.5|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Said's criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition.

A particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi cinema.

Said has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique Orientalism, ''i.e.'' of being guilty of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he accuses Western scholars of falsely characterizing the East.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Jo|publisher = Sage|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-4129-0778-1|location = London|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said essentialized the west by creating a homogeneous image of the area. Currently, the west consists not only of Europe, but also the United States, which has become more influential and dominant over the years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4009">The '''Perseus Project''' (version 4 also known as "Perseus Hopper")&lt;ref name="home" /&gt; is a [[digital library]] project of [[Tufts University]], which is located in Medford and Somerville, near [[Boston]], in the U.S. state of [[Massachusetts]]. The project assembles digital collections of [[humanities]] resources. It is hosted by the department of [[Classics]]. The project is [[mirror website|mirrored]] by the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Berlin]], Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ Berlin Perseus mirror] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127080511/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ |date=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/ Chicago Perseus mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project was founded in 1987 to collect and present materials for the study of [[ancient Greece]]. It has published two [[CD-ROM]]s and established the Perseus Digital Library on the [[World Wide Web]] in 1995. The project has expanded its original scope; current collections cover Greco-Roman classics and the [[English Renaissance]]. Other materials, such as the papers of [[Edwin Bolles]] and the history of Tufts University, have been moved into the [[Tufts Digital Library]].

The editor-in-chief of the project is [[Gregory Crane]], the Tufts Winnick Family Chair in Technology and Entrepreneurship. He has held that position since the founding of the Perseus Project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">The best-known '''pleorama''' was a 19th-century moving [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.

Architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]] introduced a pleorama in [[Breslau]] in 1831 with scenes of the [[Bay of Naples]] on both sides of 24 "voyagers" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, [[Vesuvius]] erupting. Writer/artist [[August Kopisch]] was involved in designing the hour-long show.

Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a [[diorama]] exhibit in [[Berlin]], took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river [[Rhine]]. 

The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious [[mareorama]] at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition]].

A similar idea was used for a [[London]] ''padorama'' in 1834. Spectators were seated in [[railway]] carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

In 1850s [[Finland]] the name ''pleorama'' was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibbild.abo.fi/nojen/ Posters in Swedish for pleoramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''pleorama'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in ''-orama'' - [[diorama]] and [[cyclorama]], for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The ''pleo-'' part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. ''Pleorama'' is also the 21st century name of an innovative "floating house".

A '''political pensioner''' enjoys a [[pension]] awarded due to his or political career or significance.

== UK domestic politicians ==
{{outdated|section|date=September 2018}}
By the [[Political Offices Pension Act 1869]], pensions were instituted for those who had held political office. For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes:
# those with a yearly salary of not less than £5,000; 
# those with a salary of less than £5,000 and not less than £2,000;
# those with a salary of less than £2,000 and more than £1,000.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pension |volume=21 |page=120 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: 
# a first class pension not exceeding £2,000 a year, in respect of not less than four years service or its equivalent, in an office of the first class; 
# a second class pension not exceeding £1,200, in respect of service of not less than six years or its equivalent, in an office of the second class; 
# a third class pension not exceeding £800 a year, in respect of service of not less than ten years in an office of the third class.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Colonial ==
{{Princely states topics}}
These pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. 

In the history of the [[British Empire]], the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of [[princely state]]s who saw their feudal territories annexed by the [[East India Company]] before it transferred power in [[British India]] to [[the Crown]] in 1858.

Although politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the [[British Raj|Raj]] a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a [[gun salute]]) as well as a monetary "political pension" in the form of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]]. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation.

Muslim pensioners :
* the imperial [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] family, [[Paramount ruler]] of India as [[Padshah-i-Hind]], in or near Delhi (pension discontinued after 1857)
* the heirs of its failed Muslim fundamentalist challenger, [[Tippu Sultan]]'s Mysore-based [[Khudadad]] empire 
* the [[Prince of Arcot]] (formerly Nawab Subadar of the Realm of the Carnatic)
* the [[Nawab of Awadh]] (Oudh), formerly the Mughal emperor's hereditary prime Minister 
* the Nawab of [[Kurnool]] 
* the [[Nawab of Masulipatam]], head of a younger branch of the [[nawabs of Banganapalle]]
* the [[Nawab of Murshidabad]] (in fact the dynasty of the former Nawab Nazim of greater [[Bengal]]; in West Bengal)
* the [[Nawab of Surat]]

Seven Hindu thrones, at least three held by the Rajput Bhonsle family :
* the Maharaja of [[Assam]] (not the whole present constitutive state) 
* the Maharaja of [[Nagpur]] 
* the Raja of [[Kolaba State|Kolaba]], Angria (Angre) dynasty
* the Raja of [[Satara State|Satara]], had even earlier lost all real power to his chief minister, the [[Peshwa]], who had become the hegemon of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederation]]
* the Raja of [[Tanjore]]
* the Raja of [[Kodagu|Coorg]] 
* the Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy (pension discontinued 1857)

Only one Sikh pensioner : 
* [[Sikh Empire|Punjab]]'s last ruling Maharajah, [[Duleep Singh]].

== Other ==
Similar 'golden cage' arrangements were often made later by other (not only British) governments. An extreme case was the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], for whom the Italian island of [[Elba]] was turned into an operetta 'empire' until his escape, Cent Jours revolt and miserable banishment to St. Helena.

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Ribaldry''', or '''blue comedy''', is [[humor]]ous [[entertainment]] that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross [[morality|indecency]]. It is also referred to as "bawdiness", "gaminess" or "bawdy".

Sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in [[human sexuality]], rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a [[metaphor]] to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of [[satire]].

Like any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or [[subversive]]. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its [[comedy]] generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.

The ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of [[censorship]]. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is ''not'' "merely" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.

Ribaldry differs from [[black comedy]] (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.

==Examples==
Ribaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like ''[[Lysistrata]]'' by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[Menaechmi]]'' by [[Plautus]], ''[[Satyricon|Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius]], and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]] are ribald classics from [[Classical Antiquity|ancient Greece and Rome]]. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" from his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[The Crabfish]]'', one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman [[François Rabelais]] showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called [[grotesque body]]) in his ''[[Gargantua]]'' and other works. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]] and ''[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] are also in this genre; as is [[Mark Twain]]'s long-suppressed ''[[1601 (Mark Twain)|1601]]''.

Another example of ribaldry is "[[De Brevitate Vitae]]", a song which in many [[Europe]]an-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university [[choir]]s at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like ''[[Candy (Southern and Hoffenberg novel)|Candy]]'', ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', ''[[L'Infermiera]]'', the comedic works of [[Russ Meyer]], ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]'' and [[John Barth]]'s ''[[The Sot-Weed Factor]]'' are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Bawdy song==&lt;!--[[Bawdy song]] redirects directly here--&gt;
A '''bawdy song''' is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with [[innuendo]]. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was ''[[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy]]'', edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from ''Wit and Mirth'' have been recorded by the [[City Waites]] and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual  intercourse, e.g. "The Game of All Fours". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: "[[Seventeen Come Sunday]]" and "[[The Ballad of Eskimo Nell]]". [[Robert Burns]] compiled ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times [[Hash House Harriers]] have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. ''The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men'' (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, L. &amp; Weissman, D. (1976) ''The Folk Music Sourcebook''. New York: Knopf; p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue comedy==
Blue comedy is comedy that is [[off-color]], [[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]], [[morality|indecent]] or [[profanity|profane]], largely about sex. It often contains [[profanity]] or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

"Working blue" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in "polite society". A "blue comedian" or "blue comic" is a [[comedian]] who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. 

There is a common belief that comedian [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]] (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 ''Sporting Times'' 25 Jan. 1/1 "''Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.''" and 1900 ''Bulletin'' (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 "''Let someone propose to celebrate [[Geoffery Chaucer|Chaucer]] by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.''"

Private events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with [[Jack Benny]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[George Burns]], and [[Art Linkletter]] all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; [[Bob Saget]] exemplifies this [[dichotomy]]. [[Bill Cosby]]'s 1969 record album [[8:15 12:15]] records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife "right through the old midnight trampoline" (her [[Diaphragm (birth control)|diaphragm]]) and other sexual references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/r234485 |title=Bill Cosby: 8:15 12:15 - Bill Cosby &amp;#124; AllMusic |first=Sean |last=Carruthers |work=allmusic.com |year=2011 |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are [[Redd Foxx]], [[Lawanda Page]], and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show [[Sanford and Son]]. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular [[African American]] form of blue spoken word recitation called [[Signifyin'|signifying or toasting]]. [[Dave Attell]] has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MMPC|title=Bill Burr - Christopher Cross / Go See Dave Attell|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTih1ZnwVs8|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On [[talk radio]] in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include [[Neal Boortz]], Eric Von Haessler, [[Phil Hendrie]] and [[Preston and Steve|Steve Morrison]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18621">'''Scandinavian law''', alternatively known as Nordic Law&lt;ref&gt;Wahlgren, P. (2007). What is Scandinavian law? Social private law. Stockholm: Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law, Law Faculty, Stockholm University.&lt;/ref&gt; is the law of the five [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] countries, namely [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. It is generally regarded as a subgroup of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or as an individual legal body in itself. Prior to the 19th century, the [[Europe]]an countries were independent in their administering and legality. However, in 1872, the Nordic countries organised legislative cooperation. Especially in areas of contracts and commerce, as well as those concerned with family, nationality and extradition, the five states have obtained uniform legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, H. (2017). LibGuides: Nordic countries: IALS Library Guides. [online] Libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk. Available at: https://libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk/nordic [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historial development==

Prior to the establishment of [[Scandinavia]]n states in the 9th century, the numerous regions were independent in their administration and legal matters. Initially, the legal system had no written laws; rather, it consisted of customary law that was developed and reformed by the citizens themselves at meetings known as “things”. Customary laws were recorded in writing between the 11th and 13th centuries. These include, the Gulathing’s law (11th century, Norwegian); the law of Jutland (1241, Danish); and the laws of Uppland (1296, Swedish) and Götaland (13th century, Swedish).&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

The early laws were not formatted as they are in modern-day legal systems, rather they used codes. These included private law, namely criminal law, family law, succession, property law, contract law, constitutional and administrative law. Laws relating to the Church were usually treated separate to laws of the states and people. The codes represented customary laws and usually, foreign influences were neglected. Mutual with Germanic laws, the provincial laws abided by externalities and thus, were more advanced. King Magnus’ Swedish code (1350) abolished the concepts of vengeance, stating that the king’s officials should be the necessary authorities in administering criminal proceedings and hold punishment for those who went against the law. Further, presumably by influence of the Christian religion, the legal system was introduced for the benefit of peasants and the helpless class.&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in 1380 Norway and Denmark were ruled by a common king – [[Olav IV]], the two states maintained laws separate to one another. Before the acquisition by Frederick III in 1660, supplementary laws were introduced. During the rule of Christain V, a thorough process of codification took place, with the earlier laws being replaced by Christain V’s Danish Law (1683) and Norwegian Law (1687). These new laws were predominantly based on the existing laws of the two counties with influences of Germanic and Roman laws being fairly minor. Similar to the earlier laws, these new laws consisted of both public and private law. At the time of their drafting, these codes read well and reflected individual human rights and the ideologies of equality. Further, in comparison to the laws of other European countries, the criminal law provisions were fair, humane and reflected individual rights. &lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, the laws issued by King Christopher in 1442 were affirmed by Charles IX in 1608. However, following the Danish-Norwegian reforms, a royal commission was assembled to draft a modern new code. The result being, “the Law of 1734”, declared by Frederick I. Held by Sweden in the 13th century, Finland followed the Swedish law of 1734, which was translated in Finnish as “Law of the Realm of Finland”.&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Scandinavian law==

In most of the five Nordic States, the old codes have developed by parliamentary statutes. However, in Sweden, the law of 1734 is still regarded as a formal framework. In the other countries, codes are no longer of importance, rather, comprehensive codification of public and private law holds importance. 

While the historic codes still hold significance in Scandinavia today, the developments in modern Scandinavia has led to growth in Scandinavian civil law by way of statutes. Although the five Nordic countries follow similar legal theories, they have developed their own legal standards. Nonetheless, the countries follow an agreement to cooperate on legislative matters.&lt;ref&gt;Cagan, D. and Simonyi, A. (n.d.). Nordic Ways.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1872 when the agreement was entered into, the organised legislative cooperation in Scandinavian law has progressively increased in significance. As such, the Nordic states have achieved uniform legislation, in fields of contracts, commerce, family, nation and extradition.&lt;ref&gt;Husa, J., Nuotio, K. and Pihlajamäki, H. (2007). Nordic law. Antwerp: Intersentia.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scandinavian legal systems adopted their civil law conceptions through the influence of law schools and commercial and corporations law are similar to European laws. Further, modern social welfare and human rights legislation has strong connections with the international laws. Scandinavian law, with a foundation of its customary laws, is pliable and less authoritarian than other European legal systems as it is relatively less restrictive. The laws focus greatly on rules, principles and precedents that have developed in practice, especially in courts. Further, most laws are judge-made, and as the principle of stare decisis does not apply, the courts are open to reflect the ever-changing social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, M. (2018). The Growth of Scandinavian Law. 21st ed. [ebook] Chicago: University of Chicago Law Review. Available at: https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=13373&amp;context=journal_articles [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of Law==

Although each Nordic state follows either a common or civil law system, it is proclaimed that these Scandinavian countries have adopted [[jurisprudence]] that falls neither in the civil law system nor the [[common law]] system.

All five of the Nordic states have their own respective Constitutions upon which their legislative framework is based upon. Whilst these Constitutions are all separate in nature, due to the legal cooperation between the Scandinavian states, the Constitutions are similar in their aims and contribute to the laws holistically.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, H. (2017). LibGuides: Nordic countries: IALS Library Guides. [online] Libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk. Available at: https://libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk/nordic [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian law===

Norway’s legal system is a civil law system. Therefore, legislation is the predominant source of law, however not the sole one. According to legal scholar and author Torstein Eckhoff, there are seven sources of Norwegian law, including:

1.	Legislation;
2.	Legislative history;
3.	Case law;
4.	Administrative practice;
5.	Customary law;
6.	Legal literature; and
7.	Equity

Due to the Nordic legal cooperation, this list is not exhaustive. Laws are informed and correspond to the other Scandinavian states. The three distinctive sections of Norwegian law are the Constitution, then ordinary statutes and followed by the regulations derived from statutes &lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Norway adopted its [[Constitution]] in 1814 and holds the position of the second oldest hand-written Constitution in the world which is still in use. The Constitution consists of a set of Norwegian laws based upon the legal principles of sovereignty, the separation and division of powers and universal human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Constitution forms three distinctive branches of government, including:

1.	Legislative power vested in the Storting;
2.	Executive power vested in the King in Council, Regjeringen; and
3.	Judicial power vested in the Supreme Court, the subsidiary courts and in the Court of Impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 49 and 75 of the Constitution highlight the principles of sovereignty whereby it states that the people of Norway issue laws, make decisions regarding the states’ funds, impose taxes and supervise authorities, including the Government, by way of the Storting.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stated within Article 3 of the Constitution, the executive power is held by the King, or the Queen. However, according to Article 27, Royal laws are adopted by the King in Council. Such laws are validated by the Prime Minister, the political leadership upon which the constitutional and senatorial responsibility is bestowed.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Published by the Faculty of Law in Oslo and Fagbokforlaget, [[Norges Lover]] Norway’s most comprehensive code of law. It consists of one volume published annually and used by law students, legal professional and officers of the court. The code contains the Constitution, legislation in force, adopted legislation yet to take effect and also pre-1814 legislation which is still valid and in force.&lt;ref&gt;NORGES LOVER. (2018). [S.l.]: VIGMOSTAD &amp; BJORKE.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Storting only passes entirely new Acts and abolishes the old Acts,&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; amendments to legislation are integrated in the existing statutes. The Norges Lover follows a chronological order by date of enactment, excluding the Constitution, which is placed at the front of the code.

===Swedish law===

Swedish law is a civil law system manifested on statutory laws. 

Sweden’s Constitution consists of the four “fundamental laws”, consisting of:

1.	The Instrument of Government (1974);
2.	The Act of Succession (1810);
3.	The Freedom of the Press Act (1949); and
4.	The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991)&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of Sweden. (2016). [ebook] Stockholm: Sveriges Riksdag, pp.9-22. Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the above, there is also the Riksdag Act which translates to the Parliament Act (1974), however this is not classified as a law fundamental to the state. 

The fundamental laws take precedence over all other laws. The written Constitution regulates the Riksdag – the Swedish Parliament, the appointing of Government officials and it sets out the key ways in which Sweden’s authorities shall function.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of Sweden. (2016). [ebook] Stockholm: Sveriges Riksdag, pp.9-22. Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Swedish Code of Statutes is Sweden’s official compilation of all laws enacted by the Riksdag and regulations issued by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Riksdagen.se. (2018). Documents and laws. [online] Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/en/documents-and-laws/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

This Code is enacted into statutory law, however it forms its own unified legal code containing all of the laws passed by the Government, including civil and criminal law, procedure, regulations, legal information and all other legal articles pertinent to Sweden. Although Sweden follows a civil law system, this Code of Statutes combines both statutory and civil law. The Code is amended frequently and amendments are integrated to the existing statutes. Similar to Norway, Sweden’s Constitution is placed at the front of its Code of Statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Riksdagen.se. (2018). Documents and laws. [online] Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/en/documents-and-laws/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish law===

Finnish laws and legal traditions are influenced by Swedish law and holistically also the Scandinavian and German legal families. Based on civil law tradition, the law of Finland consists mostly of statutory law enacted by the Parliament of Finland. Finland’s Constitution takes supreme authority and sets out the procedures and guidelines for the application of legislation. Similar to other civil law systems, judicial decisions are generally not authoritative in nature and there is often not many judge-made laws. Further, Supreme Court decisions may be cited, however they are not actually binding. 

Being a member of the European Union, Finland enacts many European Union laws and implements the European Union directives in its national laws. &lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;


Finland’s Constitution came into force in 2000 and aims to regulate legislation and the manner in which government power is exercised. It specifies the primary rules, values and principles of the Finnish government and democracy. Furthermore, it details the significance of the relationship between the citizen and the government. In relation to the government, the Constitution governs the use of government power, the government organisation and the authorities and organs of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danish law===

The Danish legal system is a combination of public and civil law. This mix of law suggests that Danish law focuses on societal interests and also that the states organs are vested with greater authority than the courts in applying legal frameworks. 

The legal system primarily consists of statutory regulation, principles and laws. Similar to the other Nordic states, although the courts have authority to create laws, the statutory law is supplemented by customary law and case law. Alike all other Scandinavian countries, the Constitution of Denmark is at the top of the legal hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Adopted in 1953, the principle aim of Denmark’s Constitution was to abolish monarchy by limiting the King’s power and introduce a system of democracy. It establishes the framework for governance by way of structure, procedure, power and the duties bestowed on the Danish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Danish Parliament known is not permitted to make laws which may invalidate or contradict the Constitutional Act. Although Denmark does not have a court to try constitutional matters, laws can be declared unconstitutional and void by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Icelandic law===

Iceland has a civil law system and therefore its main sources of law include the Constitution, statutory legislation and regulatory statutes. Complementing sources include precedent and customary laws followed by Scandinavia. 

The most recent Constitution of Iceland is of 1999. It is regarded as the supreme law of Iceland and highlights the leadership structures of the country and preserves the human rights of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Sff.is. (2018). The legal system in Iceland | sff.is. [online] Available at: https://sff.is/en/legislation/legal-system-iceland [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Constitution from which it is influenced and regulated, legislation in Iceland takes primacy as a source of law. The increasing propensity of social, economic and political trends has resulted in a greater significance of laws by way of new general acts targeting niche sectors such as customs, respect of children, banking, communication and corporations’ laws.&lt;ref&gt;Sff.is. (2018). The legal system in Iceland | sff.is. [online] Available at: https://sff.is/en/legislation/legal-system-iceland [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].
&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Academic views on Scandinavian law==

The Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law (SISL) proclaims that as all of the Nordic states follow the civil law system, Scandinavian law as a whole should be classified as civil law as opposed to common law. Due to the fact that common law has taken little precedence in the development of law in the Nordic countries and additionally that all legal concepts presently adopted in Scandinavian law have been derived from the civil Germanic law, the SISL views Scandinavian law as a civil law system.&lt;ref&gt;Wahlgren, P. (2007). What is Scandinavian law? Social private law. Stockholm: Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law, Law Faculty, Stockholm University.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School-related gender-based violence''' ('''SRGBV''') can be defined as acts or threats of [[Sexual violence|sexual]], [[Violence|physical]] or [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]] happening in and around schools. This type of violence is due to [[Gender role|gender norms and stereotypes]]. It can include [[verbal abuse]], [[bullying]], [[sexual abuse]], harassment and other types of violence. SRGBV is widely spread around the world and is common in many societies. Millions of children and families suffer from this type of violence. Incidents related to SRGBV has been reported in all countries and regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002466/246651E.pdf|title=Global guidance on addressing school-related gender-based violence|last=UNESCO and UN Women|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UN Women|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100191-8|location=19, 23-24, 26, 28, 31, 34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale ==
Many governments and organizations around the world are working towards getting reliable information regarding SRGBV, as it has been proved to be an urgent matter that should be solved. Based on all the data related to SRGBV around the world collected, it is important to try to find solutions in order to tackle this problematic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For instance, [[UNICEF|UNICEF's]] report ''Hidden in Plain Sight'' included the largest collection of data relating to violence against children. As aforementioned, this report proofs how physical and sexual abuse takes place at schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2014. ''Hidden in Plain Sight: A Statistical Analysis of Violence against Children''. New York, UNICEF. http:// les.unicef.org/publications/ les/Hidden_in_plain_sight_statistical_analysis_EN_3_Sept_2014.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of abuse include:
* Bullying, with one out of three students between the ages of 13 and 15 worldwide claiming to suffer from this type of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sexual violence, with one in 10 girls under 20 experiencing such violence. According to the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ), two out of five school directors in Southern and Eastern Africa recognize sexual harassment happened among pupils of their establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO/UNGEI. 2015. ''School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all''. Global Monitoring Report Policy Paper 17, March 2015. Paris, UNESCO. http:// unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232107e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also [[corporal punishment]] at school is considered to be a worrying type of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, M., Robles, O., Stout, K. and Suvilaakso, T. 2013. ''A Girls’ Rights to Learn without Fear: Working to end Gender-Based Violence at School''. Toronto, Plan Canada. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://plan-international.org/about-&lt;/nowiki&gt; plan/resources/publications/campaigns/a-girl2019s-right-to-learn-without-fear/&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty percent of the children population in the world live in countries where protection against corporal punishment is inexistent (at the legal and at the moral level).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disadvantaged groups are also victims of SRGBV. It has been reported that more than 3000 schoolchildren from Uganda, out of which 24 per cent of girls between 11 and 14 years old suffering from disabilities are victims of sexual violence. 12 per cent of girls who do not suffer from disability are victims of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Devries, K., Kyegome, N., Zuurmond, M., Parkes, J., Child, J., Walakira, E. and Naker, D. 2014. Violence against primary school children with disabilities in Uganda: a cross-sectional study. ''BMC Public Health'', Vol. 14, p. 1,017.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Gay bashing|Homophobic bullying]] is one of the most common forms of bullying. According to research by [[UNESCO]], more than 60 per cent of [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTI]] children in Chile, Mexico and Peru were bullied. More than 55 per cent of self-identified LGBTI students in Thailand communicated they were being bullied; in the United Kingdom, over 90 per cent of secondary school students reported homophobic bullying in their schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012a. Good Policy and Practice in HIV and Health Education: Education Sector Responses to Homophobic Bullying, Booklet 8. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0021/002164/216493e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Several country-based examples, including New Zealand and Norway show that lesbian, gay and bisexual students are three times more likely to be bullied than heterosexual students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016. ''Out in the open. Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cyberbullying|Cyber-bullying]] is also another issue which needs to be resolved. In the US, the majority of victims suffering from cyber-bullying encounter the same problems at school. They are also bullied within their institutions. Girls are more likely to suffer rom cyber-bullying than boys (Schneider et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, S., O’Donnell, L., Stueve, A. and Coulter, R. 2012. Cyberbullying, School Bullying, and Psychological Distress: A Regional Census of High School Students. ''American Journal of Public Health'', Vol. 102, No. 1, pp. 171–177.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Root causes&amp;nbsp;==
Social beliefs influence gender relations in all countries of the world. In this sense, the root of violence against children depends on social construction and how the populations behave vis-a-vis gender-related issues. Some of the root issues include:
* Gender discriminatory norms: These promote the belief according to which men are more powerful than women and that they can prove their power because they are stronger. In many societies, [[Gender role|dominant gender norms]] prevail and influence people. LGBTI people, who do not follow these gender norms often suffer from violence if they do not comply with these norms. Indeed, many people often consider LGBT people as not "proper" and judge them inciting violence against this group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Use of violence to show power: Authority is often shaped by held beliefs that promote male domination among women. At the school level, this implies male and female teachers are more powerful that children, perpetrating the belief that teachers have power over children. Then, authority is reinforced and maintained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Other factors include [[Economic inequality|income inequality]], as it is a proof of social constraints.  Moreover, [[social media]], [[Child grooming#Over the Internet|online grooming]] and [[Internet troll|trolling]] – also facilitate violence among children, as this spaces are difficult to track down by the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Schools and the education system in general follow a specific social and structural framework. The dynamics of the education sector produce and reproduce environments potentially dangerous for children. It is the system itself which unintentionally exposes children to types of violence that might at times replicate, reinforce or recreate power dynamics followed by the society and the people belonging to this. There are several actors in society who are responsible for participating in and creating these dynamics, including policy-makers, authority figures, teachers, parents, other students and others. In order for these dynamics to change, a lot of effort is required at schools and in society in general.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
Being exposed or having experienced SRGBV can have critical impacts on children's development. Especially in terms of mental and physical well-being, including children's health (HIV and early pregnancy). It has been demonstrated that victims of violence are more likely to accept aggressive types of behaviors or be violent themselves after suffering from violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Heise, L. 2011. What works to prevent partner violence? London, STRIVE, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/system/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/attachments/What%20works%20to%20 prevent%20partner%20violence.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a vicious circle in which violence becomes wrongly acceptable. SRGBV can have negative and long-term consequences for the future of young people, as it forges their adult personalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Physical health and health risk behaviour outcomes ===
* Injuries, including bruises, burns, fractures, gun wounds and stabbings
* Lacerations and abrasions
* Disability
* Genital-urinary symptoms
* [[Unintended pregnancy|Unwanted pregnancy]]
* [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]] including HIV
* [[Eating disorder]]s
* Substance misuse
* Risky sexual behaviour&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mental health outcomes ===
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Anger or hostility
* Low self-esteem
* [[Suicidal ideation|Suicide ideation]], attempts and actual [[suicide]]
* Self-harm
* [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]]
* Shame
* [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]
* Dissociation
* Loss of memory&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Educational outcomes ===
* Lack of concentration
* Inability to study
* Falling grades
* Disruption in class
* Non-school attendance
* Dropping out of school&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Challenges of addressing SRGBV ==
Addressing SRGBV raises important challenges and is very complex. The concept is not understood by many and is considered sensitive for many. Actors from the education sector, governments and policy-makers and individuals attending schools face several challenges regarding SRGBV. These include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social cultural norms ===
Reporting on SRGBV situations around the world has become especially difficult since social and cultural norms do not promote this practice. Moreover, implicitly they discourage it. Many actors from society including teachers; school directors and policy-makers still avoid talking to children openly about gender; violence and sex. They fear promoting sensitive materials to children because of the taboo present in society. Work, time and patience are required to overcome set-ideas promoted by parents within their communities. It is necessary to start real and honest dialogues with children in order to create guaranty real and long-lasting results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gender inequality ===
[[Gender inequality|Gender inequalities]] refer to the devaluation and discrimination of women an girls in a society. This results on giving more power to men and boys, while demeaning women and girls. For instance, a study in Ethiopia highlighted that even though 93 per cent of male students recognized violence against girls to be illegal, about 33 per cent thought it is acceptable for male students to have what they want, and appeal to their charm or force to get. 21 per cent recognized behaving this way.&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid. 2004. ''Stop Violence against Girls in Schools''. London, ActionAid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Capacity constraints ===
Capacity constraints in education systems, are also responsible for slowing down the progress related to preventing SRGBV. One of the most important challenges is the training of teachers with the tools and sensitivity to teach curriculum against violence and promote gender equality. In order for real change to happen, it is necessary to introduce these new tools slowly, analyzing who is the best to communicate these elements and what skills and knowledge are needed. What's more, having enough resources will be very important to implement change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak coordination and monitoring mechanisms ===
Another factor that limits the progress related to stopping SRGBV is weak coordination and unreliable monitoring mechanisms. These render difficult the collaboration between ministries of education, police, social services, child protection and more. This is important because if this collaboration is not fluent, it will be difficult to stop SRGBV. A renewal in the organization's cultural landscape will be needed to overcome challenges, including bureaucracy that disrupts the flow of knowledge sharing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak service support for victims ===
Limited access to quality services, including child protection an social services among others (often absent) are due to the quality of services. This particularly concerns fragile communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Lack of governance ===
In the majority of countries, there is currently no legislation that protects children from violence at school, meaning not much can be done when it happens. However, it is the case that some countries have recently introduced legislations specifically for schools. This said, legislation related aspects have become a real challenge. As to stop SRGBV, perpetrators must be punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Limited evidence ===
Emerging, but limited, evidence base on what works, although this is an area that is receiving increasing attention. The few evaluations of SRGBV interventions that currently exist vary greatly in methodology, rigour, scale and scope. This makes it difficult to identify best practice and draw conclusions about effective strategies that can be transferred to other settings. There is also a growing body of promising practices and existing knowledge that has not yet been fully documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Insufficient data and research ===
As previously mentioned, many challenges slow down the reporting and impact on the quality of providing reliable data regarding certain types of violence. This implies data is incomplete in contexts such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability among others. This is important as all of these contexts are important to fight against SRGBV. According to a recent study by [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], to tackle SRGBV it is necessary to rely on large-scale studies which include findings that can be compared across countries; studies showing different forms of SRGBV, connections between behavior change and a discrepancy between research and practice. It is necessary to invest in strong data management system tools which divide data and will make it easier for people to analyze it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;RTI International. 2016. ''Literature Review on School-Related Gender-Based Violence: How it is Defined and Studied''. Washington, DC: U.S. Agency for International Development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Six guiding strategies for national action ==

=== Leadership: Laws, policies and education reform ===
Governments should demonstrate leadership at the national level by:
* developing and implementing laws to protect children from violence, ensuring accountability and treating all children equally
* adopting a comprehensive, multisectoral national policy and action plan to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* strengthening connections between education and child protection policies, procedures and systems
* reforming the education system for an enhanced and holistic response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Environment: Ensuring schools are safe and supportive ===
In order to render schools safer, it is important to adopt whole-school approaches that will create better environments for children. Also different types of stakeholders at the school level  should become engaged at local communities and government. There are three specific strategies:
* creating safe and welcoming spaces
* ensuring governing bodies and school management send strong messages that SRGBV is not acceptable and is taken seriously
* developing and implementing codes of conduct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prevention: Curriculum, teaching and learning ===
At the education sector level, students should be taught in a certain way and certain topics. In order to prevent SRGBV, it is important to: 
* [[curriculum]] approaches that prevent violence and promote gender equality
* training education staff to give them the tools to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* safe spaces where co-curricular interventions can be a useful entry point for addressing SRGBV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Responses: In and around schools ===
* When SRGBV does occur, there should be clear, safe and accessible procedures and mechanisms in place for reporting incidents, assisting victims and referring cases to the appropriate authorities. Key strategies include:
* providing easily accessible, child-sensitive and confidential reporting mechanisms
* providing counseling and support
* referral to law enforcement and healthcare services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partnerships: Collaborating with and engaging key stakeholders ===
SRGBV being a very complex issue, it is necessary to involve many and several types of stakeholders. Thus it is about creating partnerships in order to tackle SRGBV:
* coordination/collaboration between key ministries as well as at the district level
* partnerships with teachers’ unions
* participation of girls and boys
* working with families and the wider communities
* engaging civil society organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Evidence: Monitoring and evaluation ===
* National action should be informed by research and data on SRGBV, including:
* formative research on SRGBV to inform policy and programme development
* comprehensive national data collection systems
* indicators to track progress
* evaluations to assess impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Singing''' is the act of producing [[music]]al sounds with the [[human voice|voice]] and augments regular [[speech]] by the use of sustained [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a '''singer''' or '''vocalist''' (in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vocalist ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/vocalist | title=Vocalist &amp;#124; Definition of vocalist in US English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers perform music ([[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, [[song]]s, etc.) that can be sung [[accompaniment|with]] or [[a cappella|without accompaniment]] by [[musical instrument]]s. Singing is often done in an [[ensemble (music)|ensemble]] of musicians, such as a [[choir]] of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[gazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (film songs).

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular [[practice (learning method)|practice]]. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.&lt;ref name="Musicguides"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional singers usually build their [[career]]s around one specific [[musical genre]], such as [[Classical music|classical]] or [[Rock music|rock]], although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] provided by voice teachers or [[vocal coach]]es throughout their careers.

[[File:Gray1204.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords]]

In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or [[bellows]]; on the [[larynx]], which acts as a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]]; on the [[chest]], head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an [[amplifier]], as the tube in a [[wind instrument]]; and on the [[tongue]], which together with the [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[lip]]s articulate and impose [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].

The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]] but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].&lt;ref name="Vennard"&gt;polka dots

===Vocal registration===
{{Main|Vocal registration}}
{{Vocal registration}}

''Vocal registration'' refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chest‐ and falsetto‐like oscillations in a two‐mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355–3359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
* A certain vocal [[timbre]] or vocal "color"
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system. Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

=== Vocal resonation ===
{{Main|Vocal resonation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]

'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].&lt;ref name="Greene2001"&gt;

===Chest voice and head voice===
{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}

''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.

====History and development====
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the "throat voice" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;

Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into "chest register", "head register", and "falsetto register" and woman's voices into "chest register", "middle register", and "head register". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.&lt;ref name="Headv"&gt;

However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;

===Classifying singing voices===
{{Main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}
{{Vocal range}}

In [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

Within [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[contemporary commercial music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

Vocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper [[vocal technique]]. Typical areas of study include the following:&lt;ref name="Titze2008"&gt;

===Vocal technique===
[[File:Morphometric-Differences-of-Vocal-Tract-Articulators-in-Different-Loudness-Conditions-in-Singing-pone.0153792.s004.ogv|thumb|[[Real-time MRI]] of a [[vocal tract]] while singing.]]

Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:
# Breath is taken
# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]
# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Although these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

Since singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;
:
# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]

====Developing the singing voice====
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.

Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.&lt;ref name="Appelman" /&gt;

Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Extending vocal range===
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much can a singer sing before they reach their limits? May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.&lt;ref name=Vennard/&gt;

There are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:

# The ''energy'' factor – "energy" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
# The ''space'' factor – "space" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
# The ''depth'' factor – "depth" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.

McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

===Posture===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

There are eight components of the ideal singing posture:

# Feet slightly apart
# Legs straight but knees slightly bent
# Hips facing straight forward
# Spine aligned
# Abdomen flat
# Chest comfortably forward
# Shoulders down and back
# Head facing straight forward

===Breathing and breath support===
Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.

These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;

===Vibrato===
[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Singing|page=64|author=Phyllis Fulford|author2=Michael Miller |year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=max+schoen+vibrato+neuro+muscular+tremor#v=onepage&amp;q=max%20schoen%20vibrato%20neuro%20muscular%20tremor&amp;f=false|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|last=Stark|first=James|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0802086143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.

===[[Extended vocal technique]]===

==Vocal music==
{{Main|Vocal music}}
'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.

===Genres of vocal music===
{{Main|Music genre}}
[[File:Divine trio 2016.jpg|thumb|A trio of female singers performing at the [[Berwaldhallen|Berwald Hall]] in 2016.]]
Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.

====Popular and traditional music====
In many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.

Popular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s–notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the "[[death growl]]".

One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as "[[crooning]]" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive "p" and "b" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.

While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows

Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and  vocal exercises.

In order to become independent and survive  the competitive atmosphere and stay for a longer time and have a long career, singers must learn the skill of [[Composing (music)|Music composing]], [[Music Producer|Music producing]] and [[Lyrics]] writing, they should take advantage of social media platforms like [[YouTube]] and upload their musical contents. Many musicians gained popularity because of social media and got recognition, example [[Justin Bieber]]. After getting recognition and popularity for their "original" or "cover" songs, they can get offers for doing [[Concerts|Live shows]] from the event organisers, which is a large source of income for musicians across the world, [[YouTube]] also pays if the channel of the singer in YouTube is popular and have significant amount of subscribers and viewership. This they can also monetise (earn revenues) from [[Streaming media|Streaming]] apps.
They must also take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of an  [[Music Director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the "talent buyers" that they seek out may be [[Record company]], [[A&amp;R]] representatives, [[Music Director]], choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.

==Singing competitions==
In recent years, the talent of singing has become competitive. Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents. ''[[American Idol]]'' was one of the prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[American Idol]] Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.

==Health benefits==
Scientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.  A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name="Clift2001"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, one much older study of lung capacity compared those with professional vocal training to those without, and failed to back up the claims of increased lung capacity.&lt;ref name="Heller1960"&gt;

One study found that both singing and listening to choral music reduces the level of stress hormones and increases immune function.&lt;ref name="Kreutz2004"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called ''Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing'' (AIRS).&lt;ref name="AIRS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Doctor's prescription: 2 arias + a chorus |last=Mick |first=Hayley |date=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150118161443/http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774037978|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=June 20, 2014|work=|access-date=November 11, 2016|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on the brain ===
John Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that "people who sing are more likely to be happy." This is because "singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being." Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that "music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication" and that "singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech" (260).&lt;ref name="brain on music"&gt;{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0452288522|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who "argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language" (248).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt;

Studies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.

Singing is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title="To be heard": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405–421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on body===
A recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. "Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=April 4, 2016|work=|access-date=November 10, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent newspaper article by the ''Toronto Star'' states that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=The Star|last=Rozien Oz|first=Mike Mehmet|date=April 25, 2011|work=|access-date=November 25, 2011|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing and language ==
Every natural or non natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.

=== Neurological aspects ===
Much research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter "speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits" (130).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann Area 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, "listening to music and attending its syntactic features," similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, "musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca's area" and "the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near Wernicke's area." Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.

Singing has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |publisher = BBC News|date = 2010-02-21|access-date = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually known as the "singing center." By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that "regional specificity," such as that for speech, "may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage."&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the "singing center" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y. Wan, Gottfried Schlaug |title=Neurological Bases of Musical Disorders and Their Implications for Stroke Recovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accents and singing ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

The speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing animals ==
Scholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669–73 | pmid = 5480089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown. (Editors) (2000). The origins of music. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wide dispersal of singing behavior among very different animal species, like [[bird]]s, [[gibbon]]s, [[whale]]s, and many others strongly suggests that singing appeared independently in different species. Currently, there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing. At least some singing species demonstrate the ability to [[learn]] their songs, to [[improvise]] and even to [[Composer|compose]] new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Katherine (2000).

Cambridge, Massachusetts:MIT&lt;/ref&gt;  In some animal species singing is a group activity (see, for example, singing in [[gibbon]] families&lt;ref&gt;Geissmann, Thomas. 2000. "Gibbon songs and human music from an evolutionary perspective." In ''The origins of Music''. Edited by N. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 103–124.

==History==
The earliest known spin room was set up by the [[political campaign|campaign]] of U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. In a hotel banquet room, campaign officials spoke on the record with [[talking point]]s playing up their own candidate's debate performance and minimizing opponent [[Walter Mondale]]'s success, despite many observers believing Mondale had just won. This operation was dubbed the "spin patrol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santini|first=Maureen|title='Spin patrol' spins out|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=toNGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2229,1288893|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=The Evening News|date=13 October 1984|agency=The Associated Press|location=Newburgh-Beacon, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have criticized the overt nature of the [[media manipulation]] in spin rooms, and the media's willing participation in it.&lt;ref name="TribCritic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=Raze Spin Alley, That Strange Creation of the Press|url=http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/11/22/spin_alley.html|work=PressThink|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=22 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanson|first=Jerry|title=The spin room - oily engine of the political meat grinder|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1212/p11s01-coop.htm|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders have said reporters know it's scripted and aren't persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates' strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardman|first1=Isabel|title=A (partial) defence of the spin room|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/a-partial-defence-of-the-spin-room/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin rooms can occasionally include moments of candor, such as when presidential candidate [[Rick Perry]] admitted that he had "stepped in it" during a debate response that became known as his [[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012#November 2011: "Oops" moment and continued struggles|"oops" moment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perry in spin room explains flub: "I stepped in it" (with video)|url=http://blogs.star-telegram.com/politex/2011/11/perry-in-spin-room-explains-flub-i-stepped-in-it-with-video.html|website=PoliTex|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Rutles''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ʌ|t|əl|z}}) are a rock band known for their visual and aural [[pastiche]]s and parodies of [[the Beatles]]. This originally fictional band, created by [[Eric Idle]] and [[Neil Innes]] for 1970s television programming, became an actual group – whilst remaining a parody of the Beatles – which toured and recorded, releasing many songs and albums that included two UK chart hits.

Created as a short sketch in Idle's UK television comedy series ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'', the Rutles gained fame after being the focus of the 1978 [[mockumentary]] television film ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (also known as ''The Rutles''). Former Beatle [[George Harrison]] appeared in the film and assisted in its creation. Encouraged by the positive public reaction to the sketch, featuring Beatles' music pastiches by Innes, the film was written by Idle, who co-directed it with Gary Weis. It had 20 songs written by Innes, which he performed with three musicians as the Rutles. A soundtrack album in 1978 was followed in 1996 by ''Archaeology'', which spoofed the Beatles' recent ''[[Beatles Anthology|Anthology]]'' series.

A second film, ''[[The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch]]'' – modelled on the 2000 TV special ''The Beatles Revolution'' – was made in 2002 and released in the US on DVD in 2003.

==History==

===''Rutland Weekend Television'' (1975–76)===
The Rutles first appeared in 1975 as a [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] on [[Eric Idle]]'s BBC television series ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]''. The sketch presented a mini-documentary about the 1960s band the Rutles, and featured [[Neil Innes]] (formerly of the [[Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band]], and a frequent [[Monty Python]] collaborator) fronting the band singing "I Must Be In Love", a [[pastiche]] of [[Lennon–McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]]'s 1964 style.

The sketch was the work of Innes and Idle. Innes conceived parodying the film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', after writing "I Must Be In Love", which he realised sounded very "Beatle-y". Innes was the musician and composer for the series, and routinely created songs and ideas about how those songs could be presented on the show. He passed the idea along of a Beatles spoof to Idle, who had a separate idea about a boring TV documentary maker. They then merged the ideas into one extended film shot for the TV show. The band name was a continuation of the regional premise of the TV show, which was presented as a programme by a fictional TV network in [[Rutland]], the smallest county in England. One running joke was that it would use names derivative of Rutland. The initial idea was a parody of [[the Rolling Stones]] called the Rutland Stones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George C. Perry|title=The Life of Python|page=154|publisher=Pavilion|year=2007|isbn=1-86205-762-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became a parody of the Beatles, and Idle suggested the Rutles. 'The Prefab Four' is a pun on the Beatles' nickname 'the Fab Four' with an additional subtext: a prefab was a [[Mid-20th-century system-built houses|cheap postwar form of British housing]], intended to be temporary, often poorly constructed, draughty and leaky, and not well-regarded by those who had to live in them.  (The epithet had previously been applied to [[The Monkees]].)

The Rutles had connections with the Beatles aside from the parody. The Beatles were fans of Innes's previous band, the Bonzo Dog Band; they featured them in the 1967 film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'', and Paul McCartney (working with [[Gus Dudgeon]] under the collective alias Apollo C. Vermouth) had produced the Bonzos' 1968 hit single "[[I'm the Urban Spaceman]]". George Harrison made a guest appearance on ''Rutland Weekend Television''{{'}}s 1975 Boxing Day special, with Idle and Innes, and encouraged them to make a film that parodied the Beatles' career and deflated the myths surrounding the band's legacy.

In merchandising for the TV series, references were made to a Rutles album called ''Finchley Road'' and a single, "Ticket To Rut". In 1976, [[BBC Records]] produced ''[[The Rutland Weekend Songbook]]'', an album containing 23 tracks including the Rutles songs "I Must Be In Love" and "The Children Of Rock And Roll" (later reworked as "Good Times Roll").

===''Saturday Night Live'' (1976)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
One year after their initial BBC appearance, on 2 October 1976 Idle appeared on the American NBC show ''Saturday Night'' (later ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), and showed videotape extracts from ''Rutland Weekend Television'' – including the Rutles clip. That led to a suggestion by ''SNL'' executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] to extend the skit into a one-hour mock documentary. This proposal led to the 1978 [[mockumentary]] ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', directed by ''SNL'' film director Gary Weis, with Idle credited as co-director.

===''Saturday Night Live'' (1977)===
On 23 April 1977, Idle made another appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'', bringing along [[Neil Innes]] as a musical guest. A running theme for this episode is the "Save Great Britain Telethon", and at one point there is an appearance by "the Rutle who lives in New York, Nasty". Innes appeared as Nasty with a lone white piano, singing a short version of "Cheese &amp; Onions". Later in the episode, as Neil Innes, he performed "[[Shangri-La]]", a song subsequently recorded by the Rutles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/76/76t.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Eric Idle: 04/23/77 |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=1977-04-23 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''All You Need Is Cash'', 1978===
{{Main article|All You Need Is Cash}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
Written by Idle and Innes, ''All You Need Is Cash'' documents the rise and fall of the Rutles, paralleling much of the history of the Beatles. The project was given extra recognition through Harrison's support. As well as providing ideas, he supplied Idle and Innes with a copy of the Beatles' long-planned documentary, ''The Long and Winding Road''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/movies/homevideo/the-rutles-parody-the-beatles.html&lt;/ref&gt; (eventually re-titled ''[[The Beatles Anthology (documentary)|The Beatles Anthology]]'' and released in 1995). Idle drew inspiration from this 1976 version of the documentary, as compiled by [[Neil Aspinall]], and was granted permission to use some of the archival footage to tell the Rutles' story.

Innes wrote, composed, and produced the music. He relied on his memory of Beatles music, and not careful later analysis, to create sound-alike songs. Innes assembled a band (himself, [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]], [[Ollie Halsall]], Andy Brown, and [[Ricky Fataar]]) and the group played in a London [[pub]] to gel. During Rutles performances and studio recordings, Innes took lead on the songs that resembled Lennon's; Halsall sang on most McCartney-esque tunes; Fataar sang the Harrison songs; and Halsey sang a [[Ringo Starr]]-type song. Idle mimed to Halsall's singing and Brown's bass playing in the completed film. Halsall appeared in the film as "Leppo", the fifth Rutle who in the earliest years "mainly stood at the back". Brown did not appear in the film.

The film is a series of skits and gags that illustrate the Rutles story, following the chronology of the Beatles. The glue of the film is the soundtrack by Innes, who wrote and composed 19 more songs for the film, each a pastiche of a Beatles song or genre. Fourteen songs were on a soundtrack album. The CD version added the six songs omitted from the original [[gramophone record|vinyl]] album. The album was nominated for a [[Grammy]] award for Best Comedy Recording of the year. The orchestrations and arrangements were by film composer [[John Altman (composer)|John Altman]].

''All You Need Is Cash'' was not a success on American television on its first showing on 22 March 1978; indeed, it finished at the bottom of all programmes that week. The show fared better on BBC television when it was premiered a week later, on 27 March 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077147/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf|title=All You Need Is Cash (1978 TV Movie) : Release Info|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 66-minute version edited for TV was released on video and DVD, but this has been superseded by the restored 72-minute version.

Additional actors in the special included [[Dan Aykroyd]] as the man who turned down the Rutles; [[John Belushi]] as Ron Decline (a parody of [[Allen Klein]]); [[Bill Murray]] as "Bill [[Murray the K]]"; [[Gilda Radner]] as a reluctant street interviewee; [[George Harrison]] as a TV reporter; [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Paul Simon]] as themselves;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/movies/homevideo/the-rutles-parody-the-beatles.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Palin]] as Eric Manchester (a parody of Beatles press agent [[Derek Taylor]]); [[Ron Wood]] as a biker; [[Lorne Michaels]] as a man who wants to merchandise the Rutles; [[Al Franken]] and [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]] as Ron Decline employees; and many others. It included actual footage of [[David Frost]] and [[Ed Sullivan]] taken from TV appearances.

===The Beatles' reaction===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}
* [[George Harrison]] was involved in the project from the beginning. Producer [[Gary Weis]] said, "We were sitting around in Eric's kitchen one day, planning a sequence that really ripped into the mythology and George looked up and said, 'We were the Beatles, you know!' Then he shook his head and said, 'Aw, never mind.' I think he was the only one of the Beatles who really could see the irony of it all."

Harrison said, "The Rutles sort of liberated me from the Beatles in a way. It was the only thing I saw of those Beatles television shows they made. It was actually the best, funniest and most scathing. But at the same time, it was done with the most love."

* [[Ringo Starr]] liked the happier scenes in the film, but felt the scenes that mimicked sadder times hit too close.
* [[John Lennon]] loved the film and refused to return the videotape and soundtrack he was given for approval. He told Innes, however, that "Get Up and Go" was too close to the Beatles' "[[Get Back]]" and to be careful not to be sued by ATV Music, owners of the Beatles catalogue's copyright at the time. The song was consequently omitted from the 1978 vinyl LP soundtrack. 
* [[Paul McCartney]], who had just released his own album, ''[[London Town (Wings album)|London Town]],'' always answered, "No comment." According to Innes: "He had a dinner at some awards thing at the same table as Eric one night and Eric said it was a little frosty." Idle claimed McCartney changed his mind because his wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]] thought it was funny.

Idle claims on the ''All You Need Is Cash'' DVD commentary track that Harrison and Starr at one point discussed starting a band with Innes and Idle, based on the Beatles' and Rutles's shared and imaginary histories. Harrison and Starr also surprised him and Innes one day by singing a version of the Rutles' "Ouch!"

===Later history===
In 1979, Idle and Fataar issued a single as "Dirk and Stig"—"[[Ging Gang Goolie]]" backed with "Mr. Sheene". This was Idle's only appearance on a Rutles-related disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/rutles5.html |title=The Rutles - The Lean Years |publisher=Rutlemania.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, the Rutles did not exist.

In 1982, the Rutles were involved in a record scandal reminiscent of the one surrounding the Beatles' ''[[Yesterday and Today]]'' album. Rhino Records, at the time a small Los Angeles label specialising in off-beat releases, released an album that it called ''[[Beatlesongs]]'', purportedly a collection of Beatles novelty songs but actually a weird catch-all of assorted Beatles-related tunes. For the collection, Rhino licensed the Rutles' "Hold My Hand" from Warner Bros Records. The cover of the album was done by well-known commercial artist William Stout, who had made a name for himself drawing the cover artwork for some of the best-looking Beatles bootleg records in the 1970s. His cover drawing included a representation of [[Mark David Chapman]], the man who had killed John Lennon, which generated an immense backlash. Rhino responded by recalling the album and reissuing it with a new, innocuous cover, which they announced in this press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/lean3.html |title=The Rutles - The Lean Years - Part 3 |publisher=Rutlemania.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clip from ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' appeared on this compilation of comedy videos put out by the now-defunct [[Vestron Video|Vestron Home Video]] in 1985. The clip is simply the Tragical History Tour part of ''All You Need Is Cash'', with the sound clunkily muted out during the segment's narration in order to leave just the music. This home video release was released on both VHS and Laserdisc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/lean4.html |title=The Rutles - The Lean Years - Part 4 |publisher=Rutlemania.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innes, with a group called the Moptops backed by the Rutland Symphony Orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/rutles6.html |title=Live Rutles |publisher=Rutlemania.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed as "Ron Nasty and the New Rutles" at a convention honouring the 25th anniversary of Monty Python in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/troubador.html |title=An Eyewitness account of Ron Nasty and the New Rutles at the Troubador |publisher=Rutlemania.org |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a Rutles reunion album in 1996, featuring Innes, Fataar and Halsey. Halsall died in 1992, but the reunion album, titled ''Archaeology'' as a play on the Beatles' ''Anthology'' series, featured several tracks recorded in 1978 that included his contributions. The Japanese version included 4 bonus tracks.

In 2002, Idle made ''[[The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch]]'', which remained unreleased for a year. The film features an even bigger number of celebrity interviewees discussing the band's influence. This was met with mixed reactions from fans, particularly because no new footage of the Rutles was filmed. The DVD had yet to be released in the UK as of February 2014.

McQuickly and Nasty had cameos in the 2004 [[graphic novel]], ''[[Superman: True Brit]]'', co-written by former [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] member [[John Cleese]].

In 2007, a reissue of ''Archaeology'' included a new Rutles track called "Rut-a-lot" (a jab at Idle's stage show ''Spamalot'') which was simply a live medley of songs from the first Rutles album.

On 17 March 2008, all four movie Rutles (Innes, Idle, Fataar and Halsey) reunited for the first time at a 30th anniversary screening of ''All You Need Is Cash'' at the [[Egyptian Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]]. The event included a question and answer session and performance by members of the tribute show "Rutlemania" which ran for a week at the Ricardo Montalban Theater in Hollywood before doing a week in NYC at the Blender Gramercy Theater. The "Rutlemania" live show was conceived and written by Eric Idle which starred the Beatles tribute group [[The Fab Four (tribute)|the Fab Four]] as "The Pre-Fab Four" Rutles.

In February 2009, on his website ''InnesBookOfRecords.Com'', Innes released what he refers to as "Ron Nasty's Final Song", titled "Imitation Song", a parody of "Imagine". This was also Innes's first and only entry in the ''Masters of Song-Fu'' competition run by [[Quick Stop Entertainment]].

On 9 February 2014, Idle reprised his narrator persona from ''All You Need Is Cash'' as part of ''[[The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles]]'', noting how the Rutles had made their American debut 50 years earlier, and it was an amazing coincidence the Beatles were there the same day. He then lent straight narration to biographical sketches of the Beatles's early lives.

==The band==

===Rutland Weekend Television version (1975–76)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The Rutles members in the original 1975 skit on ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'', which subsequently aired on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', were:
* "Nasty" – [[Neil Innes]]
* "Stig" – [[Ricky Fataar]]
* "Dirk" – [[Eric Idle]]
* "Barry" – [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]]

In the original skit "Stig" is the George Harrison character and was portrayed by Fataar, with Idle portraying the Paul McCartney character as "Dirk". The John Lennon character is named "Nasty". The Ringo Starr character was originally named Barry, although in the series spin-off book ''The Rutland Weekend Songbook'', this character is mistakenly identified as "Kevin"—the only appearance of this name in the entire Rutles canon. In the original sketch, the characters are given only the singular names Stig, Dirk, Barry and Nasty.

Some actors lip-synching the Rutles music on-screen were not musicians, and did not participate in the recording process. Rutles music for ''Rutland Weekend Television'' and the spin-off album ''The Rutland Weekend Songbook'' was recorded by Neil Innes' own band Fatso, which consisted of:
* [[Neil Innes]] – piano, vocal
* [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]] – drums
* [[Roger Rettig]] – guitar
* [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]] (later of [[Rockpile]] fame) – guitar
* [[Brian Hodgson]] – bass

===''All You Need Is Cash'' version (1978)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In adapting the characters for a full-length TV feature, several changes were made. Idle continued to play "Dirk", but Dirk was now modelled after Paul McCartney, not George Harrison. Battley was replaced as Stig by [[Ricky Fataar]], and Stig became the George Harrison-inspired character. Additionally, the characters now all had first and last names.

The Rutles members in ''All You Need Is Cash'' were:
* '''Ron Nasty''' (styled after [[John Lennon]]) – played by Neil Innes
* '''Dirk McQuickly''' (styled after [[Paul McCartney]]) – played by Eric Idle
* '''Stig O'Hara''' (styled after [[George Harrison]]) – played by Ricky Fataar
* '''Barry Wom''', né Barrington Womble (styled after [[Ringo Starr]]) – played by John Halsey. The character's truncated name was a play on how Ringo had changed his name from Richard Starkey to Ringo Starr.

Also, in tracing the fictional history of the band, one other member was mentioned:
* '''Leppo, the Fifth Rutle''' (styled after [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], the name referencing [[Zeppo Marx]]) – seen only in a still photograph. The photo showed [[Ollie Halsall]], who played and sang on the soundtrack.

The band that recorded the actual music was slightly different from the band that appeared on camera, as Idle did not take part in the recording process. On the soundtrack release of the music from ''All You Need Is Cash'', the Rutles were officially:
* '''Neil Innes''': guitar, keyboards, vocals. Innes sang the John Lennon-inspired songs.
* '''Ollie Halsall''': guitar, keyboards, vocals. Halsall sang the Paul McCartney-inspired songs.
* '''Ricky Fataar''': guitar, bass, sitar, tabla, vocals. Fataar sang the George Harrison-inspired songs.
* '''John Halsey''': percussion, vocals. Halsey sang the Ringo Starr-inspired songs.
* '''Andy Brown''': bass

While the Rutles are often thought of as a four-piece band, the credits of the original LP release of their first album indicate they were a five-piece. Brown, however, did not appear in any role in ''All You Need Is Cash'', and was not part of any Rutles reunion.

===''Archaeology'' version (1996)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
After an 18-year hiatus, the Rutles (Innes, Halsey and Fataar) reconvened to record the 1996 album ''Archaeology'' (parody of the Beatles ''Anthology''). Halsall had died in 1992, but appears on several tracks that were outtakes from the original 1978 album, and is credited as a band member. (Similarly, the three surviving Beatles had incorporated recordings by John Lennon in the songs "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]".)

On record the band was augmented by keyboardist [[Mickey Simmonds]], who would go on to play with the band live. Also appearing on the record was bassist [[Malcolm Foster]] (ex-[[Pretenders (band)|Pretenders]]), as the Rutles had no bass player. Guitarists [[Doug Boyle]] and Bernie Holland were featured.

===Subsequent touring versions (1997–present)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Innes and Halsey toured as the Rutles in the UK, augmented by other musicians. The touring group performs songs from the Rutles repertoire and from Innes's solo career.

The touring version:
* [[Neil Innes]] – piano, guitar and vocals
* [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]] – drums and vocals
* [[Mark Griffiths]] – bass guitar and vocals
* [[Mickey Simmonds]] – [[Keyboardist|keyboards]] and vocals
* Ken Thornton – [[lead guitar]] and vocals; (nicknamed "Rutling" by Neil Innes)
* J.J. Jones – percussion
* Phil Jackson – keyboards and vocals
* Jay Goodrich – bass guitar and vocals
* [[Elliot Randall]] – guitar (frequent guest in 2015)

===Other bands mentioned in the films===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}

'''Rutles Notes:'''

* Side 1, track 5: The first released Rutles recording. (This version has slightly different lyrics from the 1978 version.)
* Liner notes mis-credit "Kevin" as a Rutle instead of "Barry." (This marks the only appearance of "Kevin" in the Rutles canon, although it could be stated that "Kevin" is more of a parody of [[Pete Best]])
* The original "Rutles" Musicians are: [[Roger Rettig]] and [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]] on guitars, [[Brian Hodgson]] on bass, [[Neil Innes]] on piano, and [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]] on drums. ''(This group was also known as "Fatso.")''
* Side 1, Track 9: This song is credited as "Ron Lennon," and it is the nucleus of what will later become the Rutles song "[[Good Times Roll (The Rutles)|Good Times Roll]]".
* Album reissued on C.D. in the 1990s with two bonus tracks: "[[Protest Song]]" (Uncensored) &amp; "[[I Must Be In Love]]" (Minus screaming fans.)

===''The Rutles'' (1978)===
{{Main article|The Rutles (album)}}
A soundtrack album entitled ''The Rutles'' containing 14 tongue-in-cheek pastiches of Beatles songs was also released. The CD reissue included the 6 other songs featured on the soundtrack that were not included in the vinyl LP.

The cover art of the album suggested the existence of a number of other Rutles albums including ''Tragical History Tour'' and ''Let It Rot''.

The album contains send-ups of Beatles numbers such as "Ouch!" ("Help!"), "Good Times Roll" ("Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"), "Love Life" ("All You Need is Love"), "Cheese and Onions" ("A Day in the Life"), "Piggy in the Middle" ("I Am the Walrus"), "Doubleback Alley" ("Penny Lane") and "Get Up And Go" (CD reissue only – "Get Back").

===The Rutles ''Archaeology'' (1996)===
{{Main article|The Rutles Archaeology}}
Three of the five musicians who had created the soundtrack for the 1978 film—Innes, Halsey and Fataar—reunited in 1996 and recorded a second album, ''Archaeology'', a send-up of ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' albums. The fourth 'real' Rutle, Ollie Halsall, died in Spain in 1992. Original Rutles bassist Andy Brown did not participate in the reunion.  Eric Idle was invited to participate, but he declined.  Accordingly, photos of the three 'surviving' Rutles parodied those of the then three surviving Beatles in the ''Anthology'' series.

Like the ''Anthology'' project that it lampooned, it featured tracks ostensibly from all periods of the Rutles career, sequenced to reflect the fictional band's chronology. Several of the songs were actually old Innes standards that were dusted off and given the 'Rutles' treatment. The reunion was blessed by George Harrison, who encouraged them to proceed. When approached, he told Innes, "Sure. It's all part of the soup". Innes related that encounter in interviews he gave in 1996, {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC|first=Radio 4|title=Chain Reaction|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03phrws|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
Following the release of the 1978 the Rutles album, [[ATV Music]], the then-owner of the publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue, sued Innes for copyright infringement. Though Innes hired a musicologist to defend the originality of his songs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The spoof Beatles are back in business |first=Catlin|last=Moran |work=The times |location=London |date=25 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; he settled with ATV out of court for 50% of the royalties on the 14 songs included on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.neilinnes.org/articles/RutQ96.htm |author=Paul du Noyer |work=Q Magazine |date=1 December 1996 |title=The Post-Prefab Three |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927141608/http://www.neilinnes.org/articles/RutQ96.htm |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2006, these six songs from the first Rutles CD (which were not on the original LP release, but some of which were included in the television film) are credited solely to Neil Innes: "Baby Let Me Be", "Between Us", "Blue Suede Schubert", "Get Up And Go", "Goose Step Mama", and "It's Looking Good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/writer.asp?page=1&amp;blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;fromrow=1&amp;torow=25&amp;affiliation=PRS&amp;cae=58084467&amp;keyID=166392&amp;keyname=INNES%20NEIL%20JAMES&amp;querytype=WriterID |title=Songwriter/Composer: INNES NEIL JAMES |publisher=Repertoire.bmi.com |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other 14 songs from the CD (all songs from the original LP release) have all had John Lennon and Paul McCartney added to the songwriting credits.

'''Tom show''' is a general term for any [[Play (theatre)|play]] or [[Musical theatre|musical]] based (often only loosely) on the 1852 novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. The novel attempts to depict the harsh reality of [[slavery]]. Due to the weak copyright laws at the time, a number of unauthorized plays based on the novel were staged for decades, many of them mocking the novel's strong characters and social message, and leading to the pejorative term "[[Uncle Tom]]".

Even though ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story in a stage play or musical than read the book.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/peopleevents/e_cabin.html "People &amp; Events: Uncle Tom's Cabin Takes the Nation by Storm"] ''Stephen Foster'', The American Experience, PBS, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these shows were essentially [[minstrel shows]] that utilized caricatures and [[stereotype]]s of black people, and thus inverting the intent of the novel. "Tom shows" were popular in the United States from the 1850s through the early 1900s.

== The shows ==

Stage plays based on ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''&amp;mdash;"Tom shows"&amp;mdash;began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. These plays varied tremendously in their politics&amp;mdash;some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.&lt;ref name="lott"&gt;Lott, Eric. ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-19-507832-2}}. The information on "Tom shows" comes from chapter 8: ''Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production'', pp.&amp;nbsp;211–233&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the productions also featured songs by [[Stephen Foster]], including "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]," "[[Old Folks at Home]]," and "Massa's in the Cold Ground."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

Stowe herself never authorized dramatization of her work, because of her [[puritan]]ical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]]'s version, and, according to Francis Underwood, was "delighted" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy).&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Asa Hutchinson of the [[Hutchinson Family Singers]], whose antislavery politics closely matched those of Stowe tried and failed to get her permission to stage an official version; her refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.

Eric Lott, in his book ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class'', estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, as many as the novel's worldwide sales. Some of these shows were basically just [[blackface]] [[minstrel shows]] only loosely based on the novel, and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated, for purposes of mockery, some of the stereotypes that Stowe had used more innocently.&lt;ref name="lott" /&gt;

== Productions ==

[[File:Eliza-Crossing-the-Ice-Morgan-1881.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|Eliza crossing the ice, in an 1881 theater poster for a production by the Jarrett &amp; London Company and Slavin's Original American Troupe.]]

All "Tom shows" appear to have incorporated elements of [[melodrama]] and [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].

The first serious attempt at anything like a faithful stage adaptation was a one-hour play by [[Charles W. Taylor|C.W. Taylor]] at [[Chatham Theatre|Purdy's National Theater]] (New York City); it ran for about ten performances in August&amp;ndash;September 1852 sharing a bill with a blackface burlesque featuring [[T.D. Rice]]. Rice, famous in the 1830s for his comic and clearly [[racism|racist]] blackface character [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]], later became the most celebrated actor to play the title role of Tom; when Rice opened in H.E. Stevens play of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in January 1854 at New York's [[Bowery Theatre]], the ''[[Spirit of the Times]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' reviewer described him as "decidedly the best personator of negro character who has appeared in any drama."

The best-known "Tom Shows" were those of [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]] and [[H.J. Conway]].&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt;

Aiken's original ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' focused almost entirely on Little Eva (played by child star [[Cordelia Howard]]); a sequel, ''The Death of Uncle Tom, or the Religion of the Lonely'' told Tom's own story. The two were ultimately combined in an unprecedented evening-long six-act play. According to Lott, it is generally faithful to Stowe's novel, although it plays down the trickster characters of Sam and Andy and variously adds or expands the roles of some farcical white characters instead. It also focuses heavily on George Harris; the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that his defiant speech received "great cheers" from an audience of Bowery [[b'hoy and g'hal|b'hoys and g'hals]]. Even this most sympathetic of "Tom shows" clearly borrowed heavily from minstrelsy: not only were the slave roles all played by white actors in blackface, but [[Stephen Foster]]'s "[[Old Folks at Home]]" was played in the scene where Tom is sold down the river. After a long and successful run beginning November 15, 1852 in [[Troy, New York]], the play opened in New York City July 18, 1853, where its success was even greater.

Conway's production opened in [[Boston]] the same day Aiken's opened in Troy; [[P.T. Barnum]] brought it to his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in New York November 7, 1853. Its politics were much more moderate. Sam and Andy become, in Lott's words, "buffoons". Criticism of slavery was placed largely in the mouth of a newly introduced [[Yankee]] character, a reporter named Penetrate Partyside. St. Clare's role was expanded, and turned into more of a pro-slavery advocate, articulating the politics of a [[John C. Calhoun]]. Legree rigs the auction that gets him ownership of Tom (as against Stowe's and Aiken's portrayal of oppression as the ''normal'' mode of slavery, not an abuse of the system by a cheater). Beyond this, Conway gave his play a happy ending, with Tom and various other slaves freed.

Showmen felt that Stowe's novel had a flaw in that there was no clearly defined comic character, so there was no role for a comedian, and consequently little relief from the tragedy. Eventually it was found that the minor character of Marks the Lawyer could be played as a broad caricature for laughs, dressing him in foppish clothes, often equipped with a dainty umbrella. Some productions even had him make an entrance mounted astride a pig.

== Diluting the message of Stowe's book ==

"Tom shows" were so popular that there were even pro-slavery versions. Among the most popular was ''Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is: The Southern Uncle Tom'', produced in 1852 at the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] Museum.&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Lott mentions numerous "offshoots, parodies, thefts, and rebuttals" including a full-scale play by [[Christy's Minstrels]] and a parody by Conway himself called ''Uncle Pat's Cabin'', and records that the story in its many variants "dominated northern popular culture… for several years".

According to Eric Lott, even those "Tom shows" which stayed relatively close to Stowe's novel played down the [[feminism|feminist]] aspects of the book and Stowe's criticisms of capitalism, and turned her anti-slavery politics into anti-Southern sectionalism.&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Francis Underwood, a contemporary, wrote that Aiken's play had also lost the "lightness and gayety" of Stowe's book. Nonetheless, Lott argues, the plays increased sympathy for the slaves among the Northern white working class (which had been somewhat alienated from the abolitionist movement by its perceived elitist backing).

== Influence ==

The influence of the "Tom shows" can be found in a number of plays from the 1850s: most obviously, C.W. Taylor's dramatization of Stowe's ''Dred'', but also [[J.T. Trowbridge]]'s abolitionist play ''Neighbor Jackwood'', [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[The Octoroon]]'', and a play called ''The Insurrection'', based on [[John Brown (abolitionist)#Raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]].

[[File:1903UncleTomFilm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Still from [[Edwin S. Porter]]'s 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which was one of the first "full length" movies. The still shows Eliza telling Uncle Tom that she has been sold and that she is running away to save her child.]]

The influence of the "Tom shows" also carried over into the [[silent film]] era (with ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' being the most-filmed story of that time period).&lt;ref name="Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and "Tom shows," meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.&lt;ref name="Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film"/&gt;

Several of the early film versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin were essentially filmed versions of "Tom shows." These included:

* A 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which was one of the earliest "full-length" movies (although "full-length" at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).&lt;ref name="iath.virginia.edu"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv03hp.html The First Uncle Tom's Cabin Film: Edison-Porter's Slavery Days (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This film, directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]], used white actors in [[blackface]] in the major roles and black performers only as [[Extra (actor)|extras]]. This version was similar to many of the "Tom Shows" of earlier decades and featured a large number of black stereotypes (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).&lt;ref name="iath.virginia.edu"/&gt;
*Another film version from 1903 was directed by [[Siegmund Lubin]] and starred Lubin as [[Simon Legree]]. While no copies of Lubin's film still exist, according to accounts the movie was similar to Porter's version and reused the sets and costumes from a "Tom Show."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/lubinhp.html "Duping" Porter: Sigmund Lubin's Production (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As cinema replaced [[vaudeville]] and other types of live variety entertainment, "Tom shows" slowly disappeared. [[J.C. Furnas]], in his book ''Goodbye to Uncle Tom'', stated that he had seen a production in the 1920s in Ohio; the last touring group specializing in "Tomming" he could locate was apparently operating as late as the 1950s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32513">Women are often under-represented in the fields of engineering, both in academia and in the profession of engineering, yet many have contributed to the diverse fields of engineering historically and currently.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK36356/|title=The Underrepresentation of Women in Engineering and Related Sciences: Pursuing Two Complementary Paths to Parity|last=MentorNet|date=2003|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of organizations and programs have been created to understand and overcome this tradition of gender disparity. Some have decried this gender gap, saying that it indicates the absence of potential talent.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt; Though the gender gap as a whole is narrowing, there is still a growing gap with minority women compared to their white counterparts.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of women in engineering}}
The history of women as designers and builders of machines and structures predates the development of engineering as a trade. Prior to the creation of the term "[[engineer]]" in the 11th century, women had contributed to the technological advancement of societies around the globe, including [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. By the 19th century, women who participated in engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." In the early years of the 20th century, greater numbers of women began to be admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as anomalies by the men in their departments.

The first University to award an engineering's bachelor's degree for women was [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Elizabeth Bragg was the recipient of a bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1876, becoming the first female engineer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SWE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Society of Women Engineers Blog|title=History of Women Engineers|url=http://alltogether.swe.org/2016/03/women-in-engineering-history/|website=All Together Society Of Women Engineers|publisher=Society of Women Engineers|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, it was very rare for women to earn bachelor's degree in any field because they did not have the opportunity to enroll in universities due to gender disparities. Some universities started to admit women to their colleges by the early 1800s and by the mid-1800s they started to admit them into all academic programs including engineering.&lt;ref name="SWE" /&gt;{{Women in society sidebar}}

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent in that country as men were drafted into the armed forces. To address the shortage, initiatives like [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program among others created new opportunities for women in engineering.  [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] partnered with [[Cornell]], [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, since the female representation in the engineering field, there were barely public attacks on women. Chiefly, these attacks were kept quiet inside institutions due to the fact that women did not pressure aggressively to shift the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field. Another reason why these “attacks” were kept private is due to how men believed that it was impossible for engineering to stop being a male-dominated field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Girls coming to tech! : a history of American engineering education for women|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262019545|pages=14–43|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=773eea71-2e88-4f93-bd10-b06fb8ced6d5%40sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=691931&amp;db=nlebk|ref=Girls Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's roles in the workforce, specifically in engineering fields changed greatly during the Post–World War II period. As women started to marry at later ages, have fewer children, divorce more frequently and stopped depending on [[Breadwinner model|male breadwinners]] for economic support, they started to become even more active in the engineering labor force despite the fact that their salaries were less than men's.&lt;ref name="Power Status Stereotypes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Juemei|title=The impact of power status on gender stereotypes, sexism, and gender discrimination toward women in the workplace and the career identity development of women|date=2016|publisher=The University of North Dakota|location=The University of North Dakota|pages=1–20|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also played a crucial role in programming the [[ENIAC]] from its construction during the [[World War II]] period through the next several decades. Originally recruited by the Army in 1943, female ENIAC programmers made considerable advancements in [[Computer programming|programming]] techniques, such as the invention of breakpoints, now a standard debugging tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbate|first1=Janet|title=Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recoding-gender|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the wartime shortage of engineers, women also made inroads in engineering fields due to the gradual increase in public universities admitting female students. For example, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, while the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, a premier French engineering institution, began to admit female students in 1972.

==Factors contributing to lower female participation==
===Gender stereotypes===

[[Stereotype threat]] may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ruff|first2=Chloe|last3=Paretti|first3=Marie C.|date=2013|title=The impact of engineering identification and stereotypes on undergraduate women’s achievement and persistence in engineering|journal=Social Psychology of Education An International Journal|last1=Jones|first1=Brett D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Hill|first=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christine|last3=St. Rose|first3=Andresse|year=2010|title=Why So Few?: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED509653.pdf|publisher=[[AAUW]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of [[implicit bias]] against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bilimoria|first2=Diana|last3=Perelli|first3=Sheri|date=2013|title=Why they stay: women persisting in US engineering careers|journal=Career Development International|volume=18.2|pages=139–154|last1=Buse|first1=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Due to this [[gender bias]], women's choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with [[mathematics]] and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell" /&gt;

Women's [[self-efficacy]] is also a contributor to the [[gender stereotype]] that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering.  Women's ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science and Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=167–168|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower rates of female students in engineering degree programs===
Over the past few years 40 percent of women are leaving the engineering field, there are many factors leading to why they don't go into engineering because of women being judged about going into a difficult major such as engineering, working in difficult workplace conditions. According to the Society of Women Engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/female-engineers_n_5668504.html|title=40 Percent Of Female Engineers Are Leaving The Field. This Might Be Why.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-08-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in four female leave the field after a certain age.

Women are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see [[Women in engineering#Statistics|Statistics]]). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the "latest point of standard entry into scientific fields", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions |journal=Gender &amp; Society |first=Mary |last=Fox|first2=Gerhard |last2=Sonnert |first3=Irina |last3=Nikiforova | year=2011| volume=25 | issue=5| page=591 | doi=10.1177/0891243211416809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and [[environmental engineering]]. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and [[biomedical engineering]] degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Brian L.|year=2015|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/engineering_by_the_numbers.pdf|journal=|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;

A study made by the [[Harvard Business Review]] discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan S.|title=Why Do So Many Women Who Study Engineering Leave the Field?|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-do-so-many-women-who-study-engineering-leave-the-field|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. 
Research shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”.&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

=== Engineering culture ===
[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Autodidacticism|Autodidact]] computer chip designer and inventor, [[Jeri Ellsworth]], at the [https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/ Bay Area "Maker Faire"] in 2009.|alt=Jeri Ellsworth]]Another possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values "associated with the male [[gender role]]" in workplace culture.&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;  For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evetts|first1=Julia|title=Women and management in engineering: The 'glass ceiling' for|journal=Women in Management Review|date=1993|volume=8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.

[[Communication]] is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,&lt;ref name=Dutta&gt;Dutta, Debalina1. "Sustaining The Pipeline: Experiences Of International Female Engineers In U.S. Graduate Programs." Journal of Engineering Education 104.3 (2015): 326-344. Education Source.&lt;/ref&gt;
but when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the [[stereotype]] that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.

Part of the [[Male privilege|male dominance]] in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science And Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=169–170|ref=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women's representation in the workforce in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill, Ph.D.|first1=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christiane|last3=St. Rose, Ed.D.|first3=Andresse|title=Why So Few?: Women In Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED509653|website=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|publisher=AAUW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women's exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom.  These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]-based majors. 
For universities to encourage women to enroll in their [[graduate programs]], institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia, Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, and National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|date=2006|publisher=National Academic Press|pages=26-26|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females are underrepresented as both graduate students in engineering and working engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |title=Data on Women in S&amp;E |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819125228/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |archivedate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/cwsem/index.htm|title=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|publisher=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bachelor's degrees awarded to women dropped from 20.4% in 2003, down to 17.8% in 2009, and back up to 18.9% in 2012.&lt;ref name="Yoder"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoder|first1=Brian|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=http://www.asee.org/papers-and-publications/publications/11-47.pdf|website=ASEE|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's underrepresentation in the engineering workforce varies by field. In the year 2008 women [[Mechanical Engineers]] made up 6.7%, [[Electrical engineering|Electrical]] and [[Electronic engineering|Electronics]] made 7.7%, [[Aerospace engineering|Aerospace]] and [[Civil engineering|Civil]] made 10.4%, [[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] made 13.1% and [[Computer engineering|Computer]] and [[Software engineer|Software Engineers]] made up 20.9% of the workforce. These values are even more outnumbered while quantifying the number of women who hold [[doctorates]].&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

The percentage of [[master's degrees]] awarded to women has not changed much from 2003 (22.3%) to 2012 (23.1%).&lt;ref name="Yoder" /&gt; The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in engineering increased from 11.6% in 1995, to 17.4% in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06308/pdf/tab2.pdf | title=Table 2. Doctorates awarded to women, by field of study: 1995–2004| publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 21.1% in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jaschik,
[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/14/doctorates Women Lead in Doctorates], ''Inside Higher Ed,'' September 14, 2010 (accessed June 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; then to 22.2% in 2012.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

Since 1997, the percentage of Asian females enrolling in engineering majors has risen from about 30% to 34% but somehow also dropped in 2002. African American females have increased their representation in engineering from 21% to 33% in the same time frame. Mexican American (Chicana) and Puerto Rican females have had an increase in their representation from 25% to 31%. Even if ethnicities are included in these statistics, men from all ethnicities still outnumber the proportion of women who enroll in engineering bachelor programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting" /&gt;

There is a significant drop-off rate regarding the number of women who earn a bachelor's degree and the women who afterward enroll in graduate school. Over the last 35 years, women have been more likely than men to enroll in graduate school right after receiving their bachelor's degree. Women who do not enroll in a graduate program right after earning their bachelor's degree tend to be caregivers who face work-family conflicts in the context of family women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia|last2=Committee on Women in Science and Engineering|last3=National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|pages=14–47|ref=Recruiting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The workforce remains the area of lowest representation for women. In 2009, women comprised 48% of the total workforce, but only 14% of the engineering workforce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Australia===
Only 14% of engineers in [[Australia]] are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robogals.org/about/who-what-why/|title=Who, What, Why|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Robogals|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retention of female engineers is also disproportionally low; in 2006, 62.6% of qualified male engineers were employed in engineering professions, as opposed to 47.1% of qualified female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspura|first=Andre|year=2014|title=THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION: A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW|url=http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/Resources/the_engineering_profession_a_statistical_overview_11th_ed._october_2014.pd|journal=|publisher=Engineers Australia|volume=11|pages=117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Though women tend to make up more than half of the undergraduate population in [[Canada]], the number of women in engineering is disproportionately low.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/why-more-women-arent-becoming-engineers/article1216432/|title=Why more women aren't becoming engineers |last=Myers|first=Jennifer|date=9 Nov 2010|accessdate=24 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 2001, 21 percent of students in engineering programs were female, by 2009, this had fallen to 17 percent.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; One commentator attributed this drop to a number of factors, such as the failure of higher education programs to explain how engineering can improve others' lives, a lack of awareness of what engineers do, and discomfort of being in a male-dominated environment and the perception that women must adapt to fit in.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

In the 1990s, undergraduate enrollment of women in engineering fluctuated from 17 to 18%, while in 2001, it rose to 20.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_women.cfm|title=Women in Engineering|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 17.7% of students in undergraduate engineering were women.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/files/w_report_enrolment_eng.pdf|title=Canadian Engineers for Tomorrow: Trends in Engineering Enrolment and Degrees Awarded 2006 to 2010|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female undergraduate enrollment was highest in 2010 in [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[Biosystems engineering|biosystems]], and [[geological engineering]].&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

The number of women enrolled in undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral engineering programs tends to vary by province, with the highest number in [[Saskatchewan]],  [[Alberta]], and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

On average, 11% of engineering faculty are women and the percentage of leadership roles held by women is an average of 9%.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt; The [[University of Toronto]] has the highest female faculty rate in Canada at 17% and [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]],  [[University of British Columbia]], and [[Dalhousie University]] all have a female faculty rate of 13%.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

In 2011, the INWES Education and Research Institute (ERI) held a national workshop, Canadian Committee of Women in Engineering (CCWE+20), to determine ways of increasing the number of women in the engineering field in Canada.&lt;ref name="ccwe20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/media/media-release-2376.html|title=Canada needs more women engineers—how do we get there?|date=26 Jul 2011|accessdate=24 May 2013|publisher=University of Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCWE+20 identified a goal of increasing women's interest in engineering by 2.6 percent by 2016 to a total of 25 percent through more incentives such as through collaboration and special projects.&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop identifies early education as one of the main barriers in addition to other factors, such as: "the popular culture of their generation, the guidance they receive on course selection in high school and the extent to which their parents, teachers, and counselors recognize engineering as an appropriate and legitimate career choice for women."&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop report compares enrollment, teaching, and professional statistics from the goals identified in 1997 compared to the actual data from 2009, outlining areas of improvement (see table, right).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confuse|international community}}

The term '''world community''' is used primarily in [[political]] and [[humanitarian]] contexts to describe an international aggregate of [[nation states]] of widely varying types. In most connotations, the term is used to convey meanings attached to consensus or inclusion of all people in all lands and their governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meister|first=Charles W.|date=1964|title=The Concept of World Community|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00131726409340084?journalCode=utef20|journal=The Educational Forum|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=291–296|doi=10.1080/00131726409340084|issn=0013-1725|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
World community often is a semi-personal rhetorical connotation that represents Humanity in a singular context as in "…for the sake of the World Community" or "…with the approval of the World Community". 

The term sometimes is used to reference the [[United Nations]] or its affiliated agencies as bodies of governance. Other times it is a generic term with no explicit ties to states or governments but retaining a political connotation.

==Humanitarianism==
In terms of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|human needs]], [[humanitarian aid]], [[human rights]], and other discourse in the [[humanities]], the world community is akin to the conceptual [[Global village (Internet)|Global village]] aimed at the inclusion of non-aligned countries, aboriginal peoples, the [[Third World]] into the ''connected'' world via the communications infrastructure or at least representative ties to it.

==Economics==
In terms of the [[global economy]], the ''world community'' is seen by some economists as an inter-dependent system of goods and services with semi-permeable boundaries and flexible sets of import/export rules. Proponents of [[Globalization]] may tend to establish or impose more rigidity to this framework. Controversy has arisen as to whether this paradigm will strengthen or weaken the world as a community. See [[World Trade Organization]]

==Ecology==
When considering [[Sustainable development]] and [[Ecology]], the inter-dependence angle generally expands quickly to a Global context. In this paradigm, the planet as a whole represents a single [[Biome]] and the World's population represents the [[Ecological succession]] in a singular [[eco-system]]. This also can be recognized as the World Community.

==Religion==
Many religions have taken on the challenge of establishing a world community through the propagation of their doctrine, faith and practice.

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], successor and son of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], produced a series of documents called the [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. Now in a book form, after their publication in 1917 and their 'unveiling' in New York in 1919, these tablets contained an outline and a plan for the expansion of the Bahá'í community into Asia, Asia minor, Europe and the Americas, indeed, throughout the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation|title=Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation|website=bahai-library.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The formal implementation of this plan, known as 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, began in 1937 in the first of a series of sub-plans, the Seven Year Plan of 1937 to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=lF0UquZAZW8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Bahá'í: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity|last=McMullen|first=Michael|date=2000|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=|isbn=9780813528366|location=|pages=206|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the leader of the Baha'i community until 1957 and then the [[Universal House of Justice]] from 1963, were instrumental in the organization and design of future sub-plans. This lead to the creation and establishment of a world community, with members of the faith estimated to have reached 5 to 6 million in the early 21st century, while also being the second most geographically widespread religion in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-largest-baha-i-populations.html|title=Countries With The Largest Bahá'i Populations|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Buddhism "the conventional Sangha of monks has been entrusted by the Buddha with the task of leading all people in creating the ideal world community of noble disciples or truly civilized people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha062.htm|title=Sangha: The Ideal World  Community|website=www.budsas.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Benedictine monk, Friar John Main, inspired the World Community for [[Christian meditation]] through the practice of meditation centered around the [[Maranatha]] mantra, meaning "Come Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wccm.org/content/john-main|title=John Main {{!}} WCCM|website=www.wccm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lutheran Church in America had issued a social statement - ''World Community: Ethical Imperatives in an Age of Interdependence'' Adopted by the Fifth Biennial Convention, Minneapolis, Minnesota, June 25-July 2, 1970. Since then The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has formed and retained the statement as a 'historical document'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=-ZPsISqdV5cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Restructuring of American Religion: Society and Faith Since World War II|last=Wuthnow|first=Robert|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=0691020574|location=|pages=251|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World peace==
{{Main|World peace}}
The term world community is often used in the context of establishing and maintaining world peace through a peace process or through a resolvable end to local-regional wars and global-world wars. Many social movements and much political theory deals with issues revolving around the institutionalization of the process of propagating the ideal of a world community.  A world community is one which has a global vision, is established throughout the world, that is it has a membership that exists in most of the countries on the planet and that involves the participation of its members in a variety of ways.
