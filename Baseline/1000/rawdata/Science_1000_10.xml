The '''21 grams experiment''' refers to a scientific study published in 1907 by Duncan MacDougall, a physician from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]. MacDougall hypothesized that [[soul]]s have physical weight, and attempted to measure the mass lost by a human when the soul departed the body. MacDougall attempted to measure the mass change of six patients at the moment of death. One of the six subjects lost three-fourths of an ounce (21.3 grams).

MacDougall stated his experiment would have to be repeated many times before any conclusion could be obtained. The experiment is widely regarded as flawed and unscientific due to the small [[Sample size determination|sample size]], the methods used, as well as the fact only one of the six subjects met the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt; The case has been cited as an example of [[Reporting bias|selective reporting]]. Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the concept that the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams.

==Experiment==
[[File:Duncan MacDougall physician.png|thumb|Duncan MacDougall, pictured in 1911]]

In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a physician from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]], who wished to scientifically determine if a [[soul]] had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients looked like they were close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams).&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book |last=Kruszelnicki |first=Karl |year=2006 |title=Great Mythconceptions: The Science Behind the Myths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIfEO4nvvLUC |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |pages=199–201 |isbn=9780740753640 |author-link=Karl Kruszelnicki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= wiseman/&gt;&lt;ref name=mary&gt;{{cite book |last=Roach |first=Mary |author-link=Mary Roach |date=September 6, 2012 |title=[[Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers]] |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0241965016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt;&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

===Results===
One of the patients lost weight but then put the weight back on, and two of the other patients registered a loss of weight at death but a few minutes later lost even more weight. One of the patients lost "three-fourths of an ounce" (21.3 grams) in weight, coinciding with the time of death. MacDougall disregarded the results of another patient on the grounds the scales were "not finely adjusted", and discounted the results of another as the patient died while the equipment was still being calibrated. MacDougall reported that none of the dogs lost any weight after death.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt;&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

While MacDougall believed that the results from his experiment showed the human soul might have weight, his report, which was not published until 1907, stated the experiment would have to be repeated many times before any conclusion could be obtained.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

==Reaction==
[[Image:Nytimage001.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[The New York Times]]'' article from March 11, 1907]]
Before MacDougall was able to publish the results of his experiments, ''[[The New York Times]]'' broke the story in an article titled "Soul has Weight, Physician Thinks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 11, 1907 |title=Soul has Weight, Physician Thinks |url=https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D07E5DC123EE033A25752C1A9659C946697D6CF |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacDougall's results were published in April of the same year in the ''[[Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacDougall |first=Duncan |date=1907 |title=Hypothesis Concerning Soul Substance Together With Experimental Evidence of the Existence of Such a Substance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQAKAwAAQBAJ |location= |publisher=Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=237|isbn=9785874496289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the medical journal ''[[American Medicine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacDougall |first1=Duncan |date=April 1907 |title=The Soul: Hypothesis Concerning Soul Substance Together with Experimental Evidence of the Existence of Such Substance |url= |journal=American Medicine |volume=2 |pages=240–243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Following the publication of the experiment in ''American Medicine'', physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted that at the time of death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death.&lt;ref name=wiseman&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiseman |first=Richard |date=1 April 2011 |title=Paranormality: Why We see What Isn't There |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO67ZcZ3wUUC |publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1743038383 |author-link=Richard Wiseman |pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mary/&gt; Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of ''American Medicine''. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt;

MacDougall's experiment has been the subject of considerable skepticism, and he has been accused of both flawed methods and outright fraud in obtaining his results.&lt;ref name=hood/&gt; Noting that only one of the six patients measured supported the hypothesis, [[Karl Kruszelnicki]] has stated the experiment is a case of [[Reporting bias|selective reporting]], as MacDougall ignored the majority of the results. Kruszelnicki also criticized the small [[Sample size determination|sample size]], and questioned how MacDougall was able to determine the exact moment when a person had died considering the technology available at the time.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt; Physicist [[Robert L. Park]] has written that MacDougall's experiments "are not regarded today as having any scientific merit",&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{cite book |last=Park |first=Rober L. |date=22 September 2008 |title=Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1XocNrUN_K4C |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1400828777 |author-link=Robert L. Park |pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychologist [[Bruce Hood (psychologist)|Bruce Hood]] wrote that "because the weight loss was not reliable or replicable, his findings were unscientific".&lt;ref name=hood&gt;{{cite book |last=Hood |first=Bruce |date=1 June 2009 |title=Supersense: From Superstition to Religion – The Brain Science of Belief |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDafBAAAQBAJ |publisher=Hachette|isbn=978-1849012461 |author-link=Bruce Hood (psychologist) |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Richard Wiseman]] said that within the scientific community, the experiment is confined to a "large pile of scientific curiosities labelled 'almost certainly not true'".&lt;ref name=wiseman/&gt;

An article by [[Snopes]] in 2013 said the experiment was flawed because the methods used were suspect, the sample size was much too small, and the capability to measure weight changes too imprecise, concluding: "credence should not be given to the idea his experiments proved something, let alone that they measured the weight of the soul as 21 grams."&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; The fact that MacDougall likely poisoned and killed fifteen healthy dogs in an attempt to support his research has also been a source of criticism.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt;&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1911 ''The New York Times'' reported that MacDougall was hoping to run experiments to take photos of souls, but he appears to not have continued any further research into the area and died in 1920.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; His experiment has not been repeated.&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the idea that the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt;&lt;ref name=park/&gt; Most notably, '21 Grams' was taken as the title of a [[21 Grams|film in 2003]], which references the experiment.&lt;ref name=wiseman/&gt;&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

The concept of a soul weighing 21 grams is mentioned in numerous media, including a 2013 issue of the manga ''[[Gantz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| cartoonist = [[Hiroya Oku]]| story = Gantz| title = Where the Missing Mass Goes| issue = 372| date = March 19, 2013| publisher = | location = | page = 12| panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2013 podcast of  ''[[Welcome to Night Vale]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://podbay.fm/show/536258179/e/1451624400?autostart=1 |title=Faceless Old Woman |series=[[Welcome to Night Vale]] |issue=26 |date=July 1, 2013 |quote=Proverb 1: The human soul weighs 21 grams, smells like grilled vegetables, looks like a wrinkled tartan quilt, and sounds like bridge traffic. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2015 film ''[[The Empire of Corpses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://otakunoculture.com/2016/02/16/a-historical-analysis-review-into-the-empire-of-corpses/ |title=A Historical Analysis &amp; Review into The Empire of Corpses |last=Sum |first=Ed |date=February 16, 2016 |work=Otaku no Culture |access-date=July 16, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170716081848/https://otakunoculture.com/2016/02/16/a-historical-analysis-review-into-the-empire-of-corpses/ |archivedate=July 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 song "21 Grams" by [[Niykee Heaton]] features the line "I just want your soul in my hands, feel your weight of 21 grams";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idolator.com/7603817/niykee-heaton-nude-indiana-jones-21-grams-full-song |title=Niykee Heaton Gets Serious With Dark, Sprawling "21 Grams": Listen |last=Wass |first=Mike |date=August 10, 2015 |work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] |access-date=July 16, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170716081250/http://www.idolator.com/7603817/niykee-heaton-nude-indiana-jones-21-grams-full-song |archivedate=July 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a song of the same name was released in 2017 by the [[Thundamentals]], and [[Travis Scott]] references the concept in the song "No Bystanders", released in 2018.

'''''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man,''''' usually referred to as ''African Genesis,'' is a 1961 nonfiction work by [[Robert Ardrey]]. It posited the hypothesis that man evolved on the African continent from carnivorous, predatory ancestors who distinguished themselves from apes by the use of weapons.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man.'' New York: Atheneum. 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGkindle"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/African-Genesis-Personal-Investigation-Origins/dp/0988604302 Kindle Edition Description via Amazon Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The work bears on questions of human origins, human nature, and human uniqueness. It has been widely read and continues to inspire significant controversy.&lt;ref name="Brain"&gt;Brain, C.K. 1983. "Robert Ardrey and the 'Killer-Apes'" in Brain, C.K. 1983 ''The Hunters of the Hunted: An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomy.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

''African Genesis'' is the first in Robert Ardrey's ''[[Nature of Man Series]]''. It is followed by ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]'' (1966), ''[[The Social Contract (1970 book)|The Social Contract]]'' (1970), and ''[[The Hunting Hypothesis]]'' (1976). It was illustrated by Ardrey's wife, the [[South Africa]]n actress and illustrator Berdine Ardrey (née Grunewald).

==Background==

Robert Ardrey, at the time a working playwright and screenwriter, travelled in 1955 to [[Africa]], partly at the behest of [[Richard Foster Flint]], to investigate claims made by [[Raymond Dart]] about a specimen of [[Australopithecus africanus]].&lt;ref name="Education"&gt;Ardrey, Robert; Ardrey, Daniel (ed.). “The Education of Robert Ardrey: An Autobiography” (unpublished manuscript ca. 1980, available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}}

He met Dart in March 1955. Dart, in his laboratory at [[University of the Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand University Medical School]], had assembled evidence for a controversial thesis. Among the collection were fossil baboon skulls from the caves of [[Taung]], Terkfontein and Makapan that he believed showed fractures caused by ''Australopithecus'' wielding bone clubs; the jaw of a juvenile ape-man from [[Makapansgat]] which had been fractured and lost its incisors; and 7,000 fossil bones from the Makapansgat cave. Among the fossils, skulls and lower leg bones were disproportionately represented, leading Dart to theorize that man's ancestors were hunters who used bones as weapons.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|125–6}}&lt;ref name="NatureOfMan" /&gt;{{rp|41:20}} His overall thesis was that "it was the ape-man's instinct for violence, and his successful development of lethal weapons, that gave him his dominance in the animal world from the very beginning. Those instincts are with us today."&lt;ref name="KillerApes"&gt;Brain, C.K. 1981. "Robert Ardrey and the 'Killer-Apes'" in Brain, C.K. 1983 ''The Hunters of the Hunted: An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomy.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ardrey was initially much taken by the theory. As a correspondent he wrote an article about it for [[The Reporter (magazine)|''The Reporter'']]. After receiving significant attention the article was reprinted in ''[[Science Digest]],'' which marked the beginning of the spread of popular notions about ''Australopithecus.'' The article in ''Science Digest'' also led to The [[Smithsonian Institution]] contacting Dart and eventually providing him funding to continue his research.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|123–5}}

Following a visit by [[Kenneth Oakley|Dr. Kenneth P. Oakley]] Ardrey agreed to write a book on the subject. Oakley secured an office for Ardrey in the National History Museum in London, as well as access to its private libraries. Ardrey spent six years traveling between Northern universities and African archeological sites. During this time he worked with many notable scientists, including [[Louis Leakey]] (then affiliated with the [[National Museums of Kenya#Coryndon Museum|Coryndon Museum]] in [[Kenya]]) and Tony Sutcliffe (then affiliated with the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]]).&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|139–40}}&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Peter "The Author who Stands out from the Crowd." ''The Observer,'' 1970. pp. 55-7. Print.: "His first book about the evolution of man, 'African Genesis', took five years of travel and research, during which he earned nothing. Hollywood financed it. He finds that a nice thought."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ardrey eventually came to be a vocal proponent of this thesis, introducing it, in modified form, to a broad audience with ''African Genesis''. He added to it his own ideas about the role of territory in human behavior, about hierarchy in social animals, and about the instinctual status of the urge to dominate ones fellows.&lt;ref name="KillerApes" /&gt;

==Legacy==
''African Genesis'' met with massive popular success and widespread recognition. It became an international bestseller and was translated into dozens of languages.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist.'' 2014. New York: Ecco. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 it was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;Via the National Book Award [https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1962 website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named ''African Genesis'' the most notable nonfiction book of the '60s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941837,00.html ''Time" Friday, Dec. 26, 1969. List accessible online]&lt;/ref&gt; The book has continued to bear on the popular imagination of human nature.

Ardrey's theories flew in the face of prevailing theories of human origins. At the time of the publication of ''African Genesis'' it was generally agreed that human beings evolved from Asian ancestors. Furthermore, it was taken for granted that these ancestors were herbivorous. The idea of an African Genesis of humanity was met with fervent resistance in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="NatureOfMan"&gt;{{cite AV media

On a grander scale, Ardrey challenged the reigning methodological assumption of the social sciences, that human behavior was fundamentally distinct from animal behavior. As he put it in his next book, ''The Territorial Imperative'', "The dog barking at you from behind his master’s fence acts for a motive indistinguishable from that of his master when the fence was built."&lt;ref name="TI"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations." New York: Atheneum. 1966. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of ''African Genesis'' Ardrey's theories became mired in controversy because of his notions about innate human violence and inherited instinctual aggression. (For more details, see ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]''.) Later commentators, however, have come to emphasize the broader implications of Ardrey's theories; it is now commonly accepted that the controversy obscured the core of his thinking. William Wright, for example, writing in 2013, writes "Not only was Ardrey, with his three-million-year-old unsolved murders, claiming that evolution has saddled us with a battery of behavioral traits, but he was also reckless enough to emphasize the most repugnant, the killer impulse. This inflammatory claim certainly won Ardrey attention, but the angry controversy it provoked almost obscured the main point: that human behavior is as much a product of evolution as the human body."&lt;ref name="BornWright"&gt;Wright, William. ''Born That Way: Genes, Behavior, Personality.'' New York: Routledge. 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}

While Ardrey's theses on aggression were controversial, he was also challenged on his conviction that the study of animal behavior is necessarily relevant to the study of human behavior. This precept has gained widespread acceptance and, due in large part to Ardrey's work, passed into the scientific commonsense. Following the 1961 publication of ''African Genesis'' the science of [[ethology]], which is based on the methodological assumption of the cross-relevance of [[anthropology]] and [[zoology]], underwent a massive flourishing. 1966 saw [[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz]]'s ''[[On Aggression]]'' published, followed by [[Desmond Morris]]'s ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' in 1967, [[Lionel Tiger]]'s ''Men in Groups'' in 1969, and Tiger and [[Robin Fox|Fox]]'s ''The Imperial Animal'' in 1971. Along with ethology's ascendence came a renaissance of its central premise—then much derided in scientific communities by blank-state theorists—that the study of animal behavior could tell us much about human behavior.&lt;ref name="BornWright" /&gt;{{rp|178}}

''African Genesis'' led Ardrey into a long career of work in anthropology and ethology. Regarding his later-in-life return to science, Ardrey wrote "while peasant and poet may apprehend a truth, it is the obligation of science to define it, to prove it, to assimilate its substance into the body of scientific thought, and to make its conclusions both available and understandable to the society of which science is a part."&lt;ref name="AG" /&gt;

His writings on paleoanthropology, ethnology, and anthropology, along with the massive popular success of ''African Genesis,'' are widely credited with initiating public interest in these fields and sparking widespread popular debate about human nature as it is connected to human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see Carmel Shrire's entry on Ardrey in the Encyclopedia ''History of Physical Anthropology'': "Ardrey's ... writings opened the fields of paleoanthropology, ethnology, and anthropology to a wide readership." Schrire, Carmel "Ardrey, Robert (1908-1980)" in Spencer, Frank (ed.) ''History of Physical Anthropology, Volume 1.'' Taylor &amp; Francis. Jan 1 1997. p. 100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also e.g. the editor's note attached to his fifth appearance in ''Time'' magazine: "Both of these books enjoyed, along with the scientific uproar they created, a wide general readership, and Ardrey ... today can claim major credit for having introduced the public to the new field of ethology, the study of animal behavior and its relationship to man." Graves, Ralph. "A 'Scientific Amateur' Expands his Territory." ''Time'' 11 September 1970: 1. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also e.g. Potts, Rick, quoted in Clark, Mary E. ''In Search of Human Nature.'' New York: Routledge. 2005. 103. Print: "In ''African Genesis'' (1960), Robert Ardrey introduced to the world at large the hypothesis that hunting and a murderous life-style played the leading role in the origin of human nature."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Kimberlin Brain|C.K. Brain]], for example, writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''African Genesis'' has, in all probability, been read by more people throughout the world than any other book on human evolution and the nature of man. Its influence has been very great indeed as it fermented an intense debate about these topics, and catalysed a new set of concepts in paleoanthropology.&lt;ref name="Brain" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several scientists credit Ardrey's work, and ''African Genesis'' in particular, with launching them into their studies. Famed [[paleoanthropologist]] [[Rick Potts]], who has been the director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History's]] [[National Museum of Natural History#Hall of Human Origins|Human Origins Program]] since 1985 points to ''African Genesis'' as one of the two most formative books of his early years.&lt;ref name="Anthronotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthropology.si.edu/outreach/anthnote/Summer99/anthnote.html |title=Human Origins: One Man's Search for the Causes in Time |last=Selig | first=Ruth Osterweis |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |website=Anthronotes |access-date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 PBS film documentary ''[[Dawn of Humanity]],'' Potts recites the beginning of the book from memory.&lt;ref name="DawnOfMan"&gt;''[[Dawn of Humanity]]'' - 2015 PBS documentary film {{rp|43:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, defending his film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' from [[Fred M. Hechinger]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] cited Ardrey. In particular, he quoted ''African Genesis'' (along with ''The Social Contract'').&lt;ref name=Kubrick&gt;Kubrick, Stanley. Letter from Stanley Kubrick to The New York Times. "Now Kubrick Fights Back." ''The New York Times,'' 27 February 1972, section 2, pp. 1 &amp; 11. Print. Retrievable [http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q47.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick was a notable fan of Ardrey's work, and also cited him as an inspiration for his 1968 film, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="KubrickClarkeErlichMiamiU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.users.muohio.edu/erlichrd/350/odyssey.php |title= Strange Odyssey: From Dart to Ardrey to Kubrick and Clarke |author= Richard D.

      <comment>Attunement has many meanings, and I'll work on creating a disambiguation page so more mainstream definitions can be presented. For this page, I just entered a minor edit to the introductory sentence to signal that this is not the primary way in which the term is used today.</comment>

'''Attunement''' was the early term adopted by practitioners of [[energy medicine]], originally developed by Lloyd Arthur Meeker (1907 – 1954) and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Bill|title=Attunement With Life|year=1986|publisher=Eden Valley Press|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeker taught and practiced Attunement as a central feature of his spiritual teaching and ministry, [[Emissaries of Divine Light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=International Emissaries|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=171, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attunement is taught as a personal spiritual practice and as a healing modality offered through the hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Attunement: The Sacred Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-2-5|pages=9|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissaries of Divine Light believe that Attunement is a pivotal factor in the conscious evolution of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uranda|title=The Third Sacred School: Volume 7, Health, Healing and Attunements|year=1986|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=367–370|url=https://emissaries.org/db/edl/store.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Qigong]], [[Reiki]] and [[Therapeutic touch]] Attunement is a putative practice as defined by the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH), lacking published scientific study of its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAM Basics|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccih.nih.gov/files/D347.pdf|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attunement practitioners and clients rely on personal and anecdotal experience to promote it.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Lloyd Arthur Meeker shared the first Attunement with Rudolph Plagge in Wichita, Kansas, in 1929, and developed the teaching and practice of Attunement with colleagues until his death in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|pages=14, 29|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 14 to 16, 1932, Meeker had a spiritual awakening experience that he described as a “heavenly ordination.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uranda|title=The Third Sacred School: Volume 7, Health, Healing and Attunements|year=1986|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|page=288|url=https://emissaries.org/db/edl/store.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; He marked that experience as the initiation of Emissaries of Divine Light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uranda|title=The Third Sacred School: Volume 7, Health, Healing and Attunements|year=1986|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|page=286|url=https://emissaries.org/db/edl/store.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he instituted a series of energy medicine experiments. Meeker reported that he could stand across the room from the client and the client could feel the intensification of life force.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=17|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also reported excellent results when his hands were one to six inches from the client.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

Lloyd Arthur Meeker wrote and lectured using the name Uranda, which was how he was known to his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein Henderson|first=Jaclyn|title=The Healing Power of Attunement Therapy: Stories and Practice|year=1998|publisher=Sterling Publishers|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81 207 2442 9|page=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68-JIGC0e1kC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1945, Meeker traveled across the United States and Canada, establishing centers for healing and spiritual teaching for varying periods of time in Atascadero, Oakland, Burbank and Long Beach, California; Buffalo, New York; Grand Forks, Iowa; and Loveland, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=International Emissaries|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=14–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1945 Meeker established his headquarters at Sunrise Ranch in Loveland, where Attunement continues to be taught and practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communities Directory|url=http://directory.ic.org/1142/Sunrise_Ranch|publisher=Fellowship for Intentional Community|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url_c"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Attunement School at Sunrise Ranch|url=http://sunriseranch.org/wellness/the-attunement-school-at-sunrise-ranch/|publisher=Sunrise Ranch|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Role of G-P-C Chiropractors===

The G-P-C movement played a significant role in the development of Attunement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Attunement: The Sacred Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-2-5|pages=15–17|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; G-P-C stood for God – Patient – Chiropractor.&lt;ref name="Van1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=International Emissaries|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a no-fee system of service that [[George Shears]] created in the late 1930s after he, himself, had a severely debilitating ruptured disk, and vowed to offer his services on a donation basis. Shears had been a Major League Baseball pitcher in 1912, and then a graduate of the Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=19|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He experimented with "no-force" chiropractic adjustments in which he believed it was the healing energy through his hands that brought positive results, shown through x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein Henderson|first=Jaclyn|title=The Healing Power of Attunement Therapy: Stories and Practice|year=1998|publisher=Sterling Publishers|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81 207 2442 9|pages=255, 256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68-JIGC0e1kC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The G-P-C movement saw the relationship between the chiropractor and the patient as the base of a triangle with God at the apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Attunement: The Sacred Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-2-5|page=14|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeker eventually embraced this model for the healing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meeker|first=Lloyd A.|title=Servers Training School: The Divine Design of Man, Volume 1|year=1952|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Albert Ackerley, a G-P-C chiropractor in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was introduced to Lloyd Arthur Meeker’s writings.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b"&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=25|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1949, when Ackerley was preparing to offer an adjustment to his patient, he saw that the patient’s spine had aligned before he had given the adjustment. He believed that this result was a consequence of the flow of subtle energy between himself and the patient, rather than any physical intervention.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b" /&gt; Ackerley met Meeker in July 1949 and began to practice Attunement under his tutelage. Up to this point, Meeker had referred to Attunements as “treatments.” It was Albert Ackerley who named those treatments “Attunements.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=26|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Lloyd Meeker’s urging, Ackerley began to experiment with long-distance Attunements in which the person receiving the Attunement was not in the physical presence of the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=27|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Ackerley and G.P.C. President, Virgil Givens, were both prosecuted legally due to their practice of energy medicine, but continued to practice nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|pages=27, 35, 36|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1950, Lloyd Arthur Meeker met George Shears. Meeker’s meeting with Shears was followed by G-P-C meetings at a Chiropractic Convention in August 1950 in Davenport, Iowa, and then a G-P-C conference in Huntingburg, Indiana, which was attended by Meeker.&lt;ref name="Van1996" /&gt; Following these events, about twenty-five chiropractors attended a G-P-C Convention from September 2 through 8 of that year at Sunrise Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=International Emissaries|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospect of joining with Meeker and Emissaries of Divine Light raised suspicion and concerns among the G-P-C chiropractors. Nonetheless, at the G-P-C Convention in the home of George Shears in Huntingburg, Indiana, on February 24 and 25, 1951, the G-P-C board of directors voted to cooperate with the Emissaries to establish a G-P-C Servers Training School at Sunrise Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=International Emissaries|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd Arthur Meeker led three six-month G-P-C Servers Training School sessions at Sunrise Ranch from 1952 to 1954. His classes from the 1952 session were transcribed and published as The Divine Design of Man, # 1 and # 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meeker|first=Lloyd A.|title=Servers Training School: The Divine Design of Man # 1 &amp; #2|year=1953|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein Henderson|first=Jaclyn|title=The Healing Power of Attunement Therapy: Stories and Practice|year=1998|publisher=Sterling Publishers|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81 207 2442 9|page=256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68-JIGC0e1kC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audio recordings and the transcripts of Meeker’s classes from the 1953 and 1954 sessions are still extant. The sessions included Attunement technique, nutrition, psychology and a broad spectrum of spiritual teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uranda|title=The Third Sacred School: Volume 7, Health, Healing and Attunements|year=1986|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|url=https://emissaries.org/db/edl/store.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url_d"&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=The Spiritual Nature of the Physical Body: Anatomy and Physiology for Attunement Practitioners|year=2006|publisher=Healing Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-01|pages=9|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1954, Lloyd Arthur Meeker, his wife, Kathy Meeker, Albert Ackerley and two children died in the crash of Meeker’s small plane in San Francisco Bay.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sunrise Ranch Cemetery|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/co/larimer/cemeteries/sunrise.txt|publisher=The USGenWeb Project|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bodies of Plane Crash Victims Will Be Returned to Colorado|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=August 5, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A close associate of Meeker’s, Martin Cecil, assumed the responsibility for the leadership of Emissaries of Divine Light and for carrying forward Meeker’s Attunement work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris R.|title=Attunement: Love Made Visible|year=2002|publisher=Chris Jorgensen|location=Kansas City, Missouri|isbn=0-9652997-0-8|pages=ixv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2Y_PQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With assistance from G-P-C chiropractors, James Wellemeyer and Bill Bahan, and from Roger de Winton, Alan Hammond and others, Martin Cecil continued the Servers Training School at Sunrise Ranch and the teaching of Attunement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cecil, Hammond|author2=Emery, Black|author3=Wellemeyer, de Winton|author4=Bahan|last-author-amp=yes|title=Spirit of Sunrise|year=1979|publisher=Mitre Press|location=London, England|isbn=0 7051 0271 8|pages=45, 119, 133, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=International Emissaries|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein Henderson|first=Jaclyn|title=The Healing Power of Attunement Therapy: Stories and Practice|year=1998|publisher=Sterling Publishers|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81 207 2442 9|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68-JIGC0e1kC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Shears eventually moved to Sunrise Ranch in 1968 where he practiced Attunement until he died in 1978.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt;

===Development===

As Emissaries of Divine Light grew in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, so did the teaching and practice of Attunement. Martin Cecil emphasized in his teaching of Attunement that the basis of it was a spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=30|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the early Attunement practitioners were chiropractors, lay people became increasingly active in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=41|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the early work of Lloyd Arthur Meeker, Attunement evolved to include groups of people practicing it together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meeker|first=Lloyd Arthur|title=The Third Sacred School, Volume 7, "A Group Attunement"|year=1985|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=365, 366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, a World Blessing time was established for practitioners to share a time of collective Attunement and healing prayer. In the '80s and '90s, the teaching and practice of long-distance Attunement was developed further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cecil|first=Martin|title=The Third Sacred School, Volume 5, "Vibrational Attunement"|year=1983|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=291–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Martin Cecil's death in 1988, his son, Michael Cecil, become the Spiritual Leader of the Emissaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Chris|title=One Heart, One Way: The Life and Legacy of Martin Exeter|year=1989|publisher=Foundation House Publications, Inc.|location=Denver, Colorado|isbn=0-921790-00-7|pages=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVvfAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, Emissaries of Divine Light formed an Attunement Guild, which established standards for the teaching and certification of Attunement practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attunement Guild|url=http://www.attunement.org/|publisher=International Emissaries|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of Attunement practitioners, including Chris Jorgensen and Andrew Shier, formed the International Association of Attunement Practitioners (IAAP) in 1999. IAAP developed and taught the practice of Attunement separate from the organization of Emissaries of Divine Light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association of Attunement Practitioners|url=http://www.attunementpractitioners.org/|publisher=International Association of Attunement Practitioners|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris|title=Attunement: The Energy of Being|year=2004|publisher=Heartland Attunement|location=Kansas City, Missouri|isbn=0-9652997-2-4|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Roger de Winton continued his Attunement trainings through Attunement Intensives offered at Sunrise Ranch. He also continued his work of long-distance Attunement until his death in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Keepers of the Flame: A History of Attunement|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=0-9771193-3-5|page=51|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Michael Cecil left Emissaries of Divine Light to continue his own work, which includes Attunement through The Ashland Institute.&lt;ref name="religionnewsblog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Todd|first=Douglas|title=Leader left Divine Light behind him|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/4651/leader-left-divine-light-behind-him|accessdate=May 15, 2012|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=September 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of trustees assumed the leadership of Emissaries of Divine Light with Michael Cecil's departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trustee Leadership|url=http://emissaries.org/about-us/leadership/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2004, the trustees of Emissaries of Divine Light named David Karchere as the leader of the global network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Karchere|url=http://emissaries.org/about-us/david-karchere/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since becoming the leader of the Emissaries, Karchere has developed programs, including Life Destiny Immersion and Journey into the Fire, that are designed to assist people to transform the spiritual and emotional factors that block the experience of Attunement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs|url=http://emissaries.org/programs|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, with other Attunement practitioners, David Karchere founded the Attunement School at Sunrise Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Attunement School at Sunrise Ranch|url=http://sunriseranch.org/wellness/the-attunement-school-at-sunrise-ranch/|publisher=Sunrise Ranch|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Attunement is based on Lloyd Arthur Meeker's vision that the human body is designed to be the temple of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uranda|title=Seven Steps to the Temple of Light|year=2010|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=978-0-932869-08-1|pages=19|url=https://emissaries.org/db/edl/store.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palombo, D.C.|first=Anthony J.|title=Sacred Anatomy: Where spirit and flesh dance in the fire of creation|year=2010|publisher=Anthony J. Palombo|location=Lake Charles, Louisiana|isbn=0-9763517-1-4|pages=2–17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2vAMQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The foundational principle underlying Attunement is what Meeker named as The One Law, or the Law of Cause and Effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris R.|title=Attunement: The Creator's Magic|year=2004|publisher=Heartland Attunement|location=Kansas, Missouri|isbn=0-9652997-1-6|pages=2|url=http://heartattune.com/books/attunement-the_creators_magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emissaries of Divine Light teach that the causative factor in spiritual regeneration is the universal power and intelligence within all people, and that through response and opening to that power and intelligence, people experience healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Bill|title=Attunement With Life|year=1986|publisher=Eden Valley Press|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attunement practitioners believe that positive shifts in consciousness release a healing energy through a person’s body, mind and emotions. Traditionally, the Attunement practitioner is referred to as a server and the recipient is referred to as a servee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=International Emissaries|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attunement servers believe they transmit universal life energy through their hands to the servee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris R.|title=Attunement: Love Made Visible|year=2002|publisher=Chris Jorgensen|location=Kansas City, Missouri|isbn=0-9652997-0-8|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2Y_PQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary connecting points on the servee are the endocrine glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=The Spiritual Nature of the Physical Body|year=2006|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-0-1|pages=58–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attunement servers teach that the endocrine glands are portals for universal life energy that operates through the physical body, and through the mental and emotional function of the individual, and that the servee has the opportunity to open more fully to the life energy within them through receiving an Attunement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uranda|title=The Third Sacred School: Volume 7, Health, Healing and Attunements|year=1986|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=10–16|url=https://emissaries.org/db/edl/store.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emissaries of Divine Light hold that the origin of universal life energy is divine in nature and that the core reality of all people is divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aumra|title=As of a Trumpet|year=1968|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of Attunement is to increase the energetic flow while removing blockages to that flow so that a person’s core reality can emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cecil|first=Martin|title=The Third Sacred School, Volume 5, "Levels of Being"|year=1983|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=432–437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd Meeker taught that the human connection to universal life energy relies on pneumaplasm, which was his name for the aura of subtle energy, or etheric body surrounding the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uranda|title=The Third Sacred School, Volume 4, "The Principles of Pneumaplasm"|year=1982|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=168–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber, M.D.|first=Richard|title=Vibrational Medicine: New Choices for Healing Ourselves|year=1996|publisher=Bear &amp; Company|location=Sante Fe, New Mexico|isbn=1-879181-28-2|pages=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioAqGwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attunement practitioners believe that pneumaplasm is generated when the universal life energy flows through a person, and that the clarity of the pneumaplasmic body depends on the clarity of that energy flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Attunement: The Sacred Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-2-5|page=22|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attunement practitioners focus on clarifying and enriching the pneumaplasm associated with the endocrine glands and the anatomical systems of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Attunement: The Sacred Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-2-5|page=33|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners believe that the endocrine glands translate seven aspects of the universal life energy into the human experience. They name these as the Seven Spirits.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris|title=Attunement: The Creator's Magic|year=2004|publisher=Heartland Attunement|location=Kansas City, Missouri|isbn=0-9652997-1-6|pages=71–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Attunement practitioners relate these Seven Spirits to the [[Seven Spirits of God]] referenced in the book of Revelation in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen2004" /&gt; Some Attunement practitioners correlate the seven endocrine glands with seven chakras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palombo, D.C.|first=Anthony J.|title=Sacred Anatomy: Where spirit and flesh dance in the fire of creation|year=2010|publisher=Anthony J. Palombo|location=Lake Charles, Louisiana|isbn=0-9763517-1-4|pages=24–25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2vAMQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
At the core of the teaching of the technique is the establishment of an energetic circuit between the practitioner (server) and the client (servee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=The Spiritual Nature of the Physical Body: Anatomy and Physiology for Attunement Practitioners|year=2006|publisher=Healing Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-01|pages=31–32|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners seek to establish that circuit by the radiant extension of life energy through the dominant hand of the practitioner to the gland or organ of the client, and the receiving of life energy through the opposite hand from a corresponding contact point in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Laurence|title=Attunement: The Sacred Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Health Light Publishing Company|location=St. Augustine, Florida|isbn=978-0-9771193-2-5|pages=77–92|url=http://healthlightbooks.com/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeker taught that the first step in the Attunement process was the alignment of the cervical vertebrae by the radiation of healing energy through the hands on either side of the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Duzen|first=Grace|title=The Vibrational Ark|year=1996|publisher=International Emissaries|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-932869-05-X|pages=218–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Attunement practitioners continue to teach attunement technique that begins and ends with an Attunement of the cervical vertebrae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris|title=Attunement: The Energy of Being|year=2004|publisher=Heartland Attunement|location=Kansas City, Missouri|isbn=0-9652997-2-4|pages=26, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the cervical Attunement is followed by Attunement of the endocrine glands and some of the major organs of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris|title=Attunement: The Energy of Being|year=2004|publisher=Heartland Attunement|location=Kansas City, Missouri|isbn=0-9652997-2-4|pages=26–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual practice==
As a spiritual practice, Attunement is intended to connect a person more closely to their spiritual source and to open the flow of life current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karchere|first=David|title=Meditation and True Freedom|url=https://emissaries.org/2012/05/24/meditation-and-real-freedom/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice includes conscious attention to the quality of spirit expressing through the practitioner in the daily living of life, and specific periods of meditation in the beginning and ending of each day, taught as Sanctification in the Evening and the Morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cecil|first=Martin|title=The Third Sacred School, Volume 11, "Sanctification in the Evening and the Morning"|year=1990|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|location=Loveland, Colorado|pages=74–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central aspect of Attunement as a spiritual practice is referred to by Emissaries of Divine Light as spiritual centering, which they define as a daily practice of opening thoughts and emotions to the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karchere|first=David|title=Spiritual Centering|url=http://emissaries.org/2012/03/12/spiritual-centering/|publisher=Emissaries of Divine Light|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this mode of [[science]] argue that unanticipated scientific breakthroughs are sometimes more valuable than the outcomes of agenda-driven research, heralding advances in [[genetics]] and [[stem cell]] biology as examples of unforeseen benefits of research that was originally seen as purely theoretical in scope. Because of the inherently uncertain [[return on investment]], blue-sky projects are politically and commercially unpopular and tend to lose funding to more reliably profitable or practical research.&lt;ref name="times 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article568223.ece|title=Politics clouds blue-sky science|work=The Times|date=September 19, 2005  | accessdate=April 26, 2010 | first=Mark | last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Support for blue skies research has varied over time, ultimately becoming subject to the political process, in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundation.org.uk/|title=To what extent should UK funding for science and innovation be focussed?|work=Foundation for Science and Technology  |accessdate=February 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India. [[Vannevar Bush]]'s 1945 report, ''[https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/vbush1945.htm Science: The Endless Frontier]'', made the argument for the value of basic research in the postwar era, and was the basis for many appeals to the federal funding of basic research.&lt;ref name="smith 1997"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The 1957 launch of [[Sputnik]] prompted the United States [[Air Force Office of Scientific Research]] to sponsor blue skies research into the 1960s.&lt;ref name="jeffrey"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, financial strains brought pressure on public expenditure on the sciences, first in the UK and the [[Netherlands]], and by the 1990s in [[Germany]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="smith 1997"/&gt;

In 1980, [[British Petroleum]] (known as BP after 2000) established a blue skies research initiative called the Venture Research Unit, headed by particle physicist [[Donald Braben]]. Braben controversially challenged [[peer review]] as the mechanism for establishing funding, emphasizing the selection of researchers whose proposals "could radically change the way we think about something important."&lt;ref name=" review 2004"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Mark Walport]], director of the [[Wellcome Trust]] and former Professor of Medicine at [[Imperial College, London]] warned that excessive emphasis on agenda-driven research could jeopardise serendipitous advances in science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government is right to recognise the importance of science and technology, but I think it is a mistake to try to [[wikt:ringfence|ring-fence]] funds. There is a serious danger that we will spend money on projects that are less good. It is absolutely key that funding is used to support the best scientists with the best ideas.&lt;ref name="times 2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When UK [[research council]]s introduced a requirement that grant application include a 2-page statement on the economic impact of the proposed work, 20 scientists, including 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel laureate]] [[Harold Kroto]], wrote a public letter to ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' condemning the requirement and calling for peer reviewers to ignore the additional documentation.&lt;ref name="sciencemag blog"&gt;

==Grants and conferences==

[[The Royal Society]] grants up to 1 million [[pounds sterling]] annually in ''Theo Murphy Blue Skies awards'' to fund "research which is considered to be original and exciting but lacks a sufficient evidence base in the literature to be supported by traditional grant schemes."&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;

The UK-based [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC) operates a program called the IDEAS Factory, intended to promote "blue sky, curiosity-led research."&lt;ref name="nottingham"&gt;

The international [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) holds a "Blue Sky Forum" every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/conferences/science2005/index-eng.htm|title=Blue Sky II 2006|work=Statistics Canada|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116125256/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/conferences/science2005/index-eng.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subjects ==

Owing to its radical nature, blue sky science may challenge accepted [[Paradigm#Scientific paradigm|scientific paradigms]] and introduce entirely new fields of study.&lt;ref name="linden 2008"/&gt; It has been the inspiration for numerous works of [[science fiction]]. It has sometimes been concerned with topics such as unexplained phenomena and the impact of future technologies upon society, asking questions such as "How would a spacecraft traverse a [[black hole]] and where would it arrive upon leaving it?" and "Will the universe end, or will it just expand ever outwards for eternity?"{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

'''Body memory''' (BM) is a [[hypothesis]] that the body itself is capable of storing memories, as opposed to only the brain. While experiments have demonstrated the possibility of cellular memory{{R|"cosier"}} there are currently no known means by which tissues other than the brain would be capable of storing memories.{{R|"Smith"}}{{R|"Lilienfeld"}}

Modern usage of BM tends to frame it exclusively in the context of traumatic memory and ways in which the body responds to recall of a memory. In this regard, it has become relevant in treatment for [[PTSD]].{{R|"M.D.2014"}}

== Overview ==

Peter Levine calls BM ''[[implicit memory]]'' or more specifically [[procedural memory]], things that the body is capable of doing automatically and not in one's consciousness. He clarifies 3 types of BM and frames his work in terms of [[traumatic memory]] consequence and resolution:{{R|"levine"}}
#Learned motor actions - Action patterns that can be continuously modified over time by higher brain regions.
#Emergency response - Hardwired instinctual behaviors (i.e., fight or flight response, etc...).
#Attraction or repulsion - We are attracted to sources of nourishment and growth and repulsed from sources of injury or toxicity.

Nicola Diamond elaborates on the opinion of philosopher [[Merleau Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]] and asserts that BM is formed by doing. Whether practicing a bodily activity or forming a reaction to a traumatic memory.{{R|"Diamond2013"}}

Edward Casey speaks of BM as, "memory intrinsic to the body, how we remember by and through the body", rather than what is remembered about the body.{{R|"Casey2009"}}

Thomas Fuchs defines 6 different types of BM: procedural, situational, intercorporeal, incorporative, pain, and traumatic memory. He notes that they are not strictly separable from one another but "derived from different dimensions of bodily experience.{{R|"KochFuchs2012"}}{{RP|12}} Michelle Summa further refines this definition as an implicit memory. A pre-thematic, operative consciousness of the past expressed through the body.{{R|"KochFuchs2012"}}{{RP|30}}

[[Antonio Damasio]] calls these reactions to memories ''somatic markers'' or emotions that are expressed primarily as physical feelings.{{R|"Ansermet2018"}}

These memories are often associated with [[phantom pain]] in a part or parts of the body – the body appearing to remember the past trauma.  The idea of body memory is a belief frequently associated with the idea of [[repressed memories]], in which memories of incest or sexual abuse can be retained and recovered through physical sensations.{{R|"Smith"}} It may also be associated with phantom limb sensation but this is less common.{{R|"price"}}

=== Skepticism ===

In 1993, Susan E. Smith, presented a paper relating the idea of "Survivor Psychology" at a [[false memory syndrome]] [[Academic conference|conference]], stated about BM that, "body memories are thought to literally be emotional, kinesthetic, or chemical recordings stored at the cellular level and retrievable by returning to or recreating the chemical, emotional, or kinesthetic conditions under which the memory recordings are filed.{{R|"Smith"}} She went on in the abstract of the paper, "one of the most commonly used theories to support the ideology of [[repressed memories]] or incest and sexual abuse amnesia is body memories." and "The belief in these pseudoscientific concepts appears to be related to [[Scientific literacy|scientific illiteracy]], gullibility, and a lack of critical thinking skills and reasoning abilities in both the mental health community and in society at large"{{R|"Smith"}}

A 2017 systematic review of cross-disciplinary research in body memory found that the available data neither largely support or refute the claim that memories are stored outside of the brain and more research is needed.{{R|"riva"}}

In the ''Encyclopedia of Phenomenology'' Embree notes that, "To posit body memory is to open up a [[Pandora's Box]]", and links the idea to physical associations of memory rather than as a memory stored in a bodily manner.{{R|"Embree2013"}}

== Cellular memory ==

Cellular memory (CM) is a parallel hypothesis to BM positing that memories can be stored outside the brain in all cells.{{R|"skepdic"}} The idea that non-brain tissues can have memories is believed by some who have received [[organ transplantation|organ transplants]], though this is considered impossible. The author said the stories are intriguing though and may lead to some serious scientific investigation in the future.{{R|"skepdic"}} In his book ''TransplantNation'' Douglas Vincent suggests that atypical newfound memories, thoughts, emotions and preferences after an organ transplant are more suggestive of [[immunosuppressant drugs]] and the stress of surgery on perception than of legitimate memory transference. In other words, "as imaginary as a bad trip on [[LSD]] or other [[psychotropic drug]]."{{R|"vincent"}}

=== Flatworms ===

Biologists at [[Tufts University]] have been able to train [[flatworms]] despite the loss of the brain and head. This may show memory stored in other parts of the body in some animals.{{R|"planaria"}} A worm reduced to 1/279th of the original can be regrown within a few weeks and be trained much quicker to head towards light and open space for food, an unnatural behavior for a flatworm. With each head removed training times appear reduced. This may just be a sign of [[epigenetics]] showing the appearance of memory.{{R|"anthony"}}

However, in the 1950s and 1960s [[James V. McConnell|James McConnell]] flatworm experiments measured how long it took to learn a maze. McConnell trained some to move around a maze and then chopped them up and fed them to untrained worms. The untrained group learned faster compared to a control that had not been fed trained worms. McConnell believed the experiment indicated cellular memory.{{R|"Hood"}} The training involved stressing the worms with electric shock. This kind of stress releases persistent [[hormones]] and shows no evidence for memory transfer. Similar experiments with mice being trained and being fed to untrained mice showed improved learning. It was not a memory that was transferred but hormone enriched tissue.{{R|"Hood"}}

=== Current usage and research ===
{{See Also|Epigenetics|Immune memory}}

In epigenetics there are various mechanisms for cells to pass on "memories" of stressors to their progeny. Strategies include Msn2 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, changes in chromatin, partitioning of anti-stress factors, and damaged [[macromolecules]] between mother and daughter cells.{{R|"pmid29846762"}}

In [[adaptive immunity]] there is a functional CM that enables he immune system to learn to react to pathogens through mechanisms such as, cytoxic memory mediation in [[bone marrow]],{{R|"pmid15978522"}}, innate immune memory in [[stromal cells]],{{R|"pmid29729109"}}, [[fungal]] mediation of innate and inherited [[immunological]] response,{{R|"pmid29842944"}} and T and B-cell immune training.{{R|"rosenblum"}} In this regard CM is essential for [[vaccine]] and [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] research.

'''Borderless selling''' is the process of [[selling]] services to clients outside the country of origin of services through modern methods which eliminate the actions specifically designed to hinder [[international trade]]. International trade through "borderless selling" is a new phenomenon born in the current "[[globalization]]" era.

==Definitions==
'''Borderless selling''' is defined as the process of performing [[sales]] transaction between two or more parties from different countries (an [[exporter]] and an [[importer]]) which is free from actions specifically designed to hinder [[international trade]], such as [[tariff barrier]]s, [[currency restriction]]s, and [[import quota]]s.

==Background==
[[International trade]] which is the exchange of goods and services across international borders has been present throughout much of history of [[economics]], [[society]] and [[politics]]. 

It is assumed that [[offshore outsourcing]] gave birth to "borderless selling". The selling of services by [[offshore outsourcing]] service providers to foreign clients is free from actions specifically designed to hinder international trade, such as tariff barriers, currency restrictions, and import quotas. This is largely because most of the services are sold or delivered electronically from the offshore service provider to the foreign client. This phenomenon gave birth to borderless selling.

There is a high correlation between outsourcing and exporting activity. However, borderless selling is different from free international trade or selling. Under the belief in [[Mercantilism]], most nations had high tariffs and many restrictions on international trade for centuries. In the 19th century, a belief in free trade became paramount in west, especially in Britain and this outlook has since then dominated the thinking of [[western nations]]. Traditionally international trade was possible between only those countries which regulated international trade through [[bilateral treaty|bilateral treaties]]. Borderless selling is possible between any two countries of the world because services can be exported using modern telecommunication networks without the need to regulate trade.

The "borderless selling" term was originated as part of the research carried out by team led by Paramjeev Singh Sethi.

&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the shear stress (τ) required to slide one rock over another. The rocks have macroscopically flat surfaces, but the surfaces have small asperities that make them "rough." For a given experiment and at normal stresses (σ&lt;small&gt;n&lt;/small&gt;) below about 2000 bars (200 MPa) the shear stress increases approximately linearly with the normal stress (τ = 0.85 σ&lt;small&gt;n&lt;/small&gt;) and is highly dependent on rock type and the character (roughness) of the surfaces, see [[Mohr-Coulomb friction law]]. Byerlee's law states that with increased normal stress the required shear stress continues to increase, but the ''rate'' of increase decreases (τ = 0.5 + 0.6σ&lt;small&gt;n&lt;/small&gt;), and becomes nearly independent of rock type.&lt;ref name=Byerlee1978&gt;

'''Challenger Center for Space Science Education''' is a [[United States]] 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] headquartered in [[Washington, DC]]. It was founded in 1986 by the families of the astronauts who died in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] on January 28, 1986.

The organization offers dynamic, hands-on exploration and discovery opportunities to students around the world. These programs equip students with the knowledge, confidence, and skills that will help better our national social and economic well-being.

Challenger Learning Centers give students the chance to become astronauts and engineers and solve real-world problems as they share the thrill of discovery on missions through the Solar System. Using space simulation and role-playing strategies, students bring their classroom studies to life and cultivate the skills needed for future success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11903">'''Clinical and Translational Science Award''' (CTSA) is a type of [[Federal grants in the United States|U.S. federal grant]] administered by the [[National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The CTSA program began in October 2006 under the auspices of the [[National Center for Research Resources]] with a [[consortium]] of 12 [[Medical school in the United States#Academic health centers|academic health centers]]. The program was fully implemented in 2012, comprising 60 grantee institutions and their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/clinicalresearch/overview-translational.asp |title=Re-engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise: Translational Research |author=National Institutes of Health |date=Sep 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program overview ==
The CTSA program helps institutions create an integrated academic home for clinical and [[translational science]] with the resources to support researchers and research teams working to apply new knowledge and techniques to patient care. The program is structured to encourage collaborations among researchers from different scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-10-001.html |title=Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award (U54)|author=National Institutes of Health |date=Jan 26, 2010|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CTSA program has raised awareness of clinical and translational science as a [[academic discipline|discipline]] among academic and industry researchers, philanthropists, government officials and the broader public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ctssociety.org/Home/PresidentsLetterMay2009/tabid/71/ItemId/0/Default.aspx |title=Presidents Letter|author1=Society for Clinical |author2=Translational Science |date=May 22, 2009|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic goals ==
CTSA consortium leaders have set five broad goals to guide their activities. These include building national clinical and translational research capability, providing training and improving career development of clinical and translational scientists, enhancing consortium-wide collaborations, improving the health of U.S. communities and the nation, and advancing [[Translational medicine#Phase one research|T1 translational research]] to move basic laboratory discoveries and knowledge into clinical testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected research areas ==
Institutions funded by the CTSA program are working with other research facilities to improve drug discovery and development. For example, several consortium institutions are collaborating with the [http://www.nrrrc.missouri.edu Rat Resource and Research Center] at the [[University of Missouri]] to increase the speed of drug screening so that drug research is translated into clinical uses more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consortium institutions also are creating new fields of study or new uses for technologies. For example, researchers at the [[University of Rochester]] are pioneering the field of [[lipidomics]], exploring how [[lipids]] affect human disease. Their work has led to lipid research collaborations among experts in community and [[preventive medicine]], [[proteomics]], [[nutrition]], and [[pharmaceutical research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some CTSA institutions are collaborating with [[community-based organization]]s to ensure research is translated successfully into clinical practice. Researchers at [[Duke University]] are working to prevent [[stroke]]s by partnering with a local health care program to build stroke awareness among Latino immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are pursuing [[Public-private partnership|public and private partnerships]] to speed innovation. For example, the [[Oregon Health and Science University]] and [[Intel]] are developing new wireless devices with sensors to detect [[symptoms]] in patients who have [[diabetes]] or those at high risk of [[stroke]] so they can be treated earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participating institutions ==
With the most recent awards, announced in July 2011, the consortium comprises 60 institutions in 30 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2011/07_22_2011/story8.htm |title=NIH Announces Five New Clinical and Translational Science Awards | author=National Institutes of Health |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctsaweb.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.showPartInstList |title=CTSA Institutions |author=Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium |date=September 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG)==

On the 20 December 2011, the OIG published a report critical of the NIH's administration of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-09-00300.pdf | title = NIH Administration of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Program (Report OEI-07-09-00300) | accessdate = 2011-12-22 | date = December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report read in part:

{{Quote box |quote =For all 38 Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) cooperative agreements awarded from 2006 through 2008, CTSA program staff did not document awardees' progress in compliance with NIH policy.

CTSA program staff must ensure that awardees submit annual progress reports and financial status reports, determine whether awardee progress remains satisfactory before awardees receive continued funding, and maintain official files in accordance with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) policy. Additionally, under cooperative agreements, CTSA program staff provide assistance to awardees above and beyond the levels usually required for program stewardship of grants. This level of stewardship is known as substantial involvement. CTSA program staff assign NIH Project Scientists to awardees to provide this substantial involvement through technical assistance, advice, and coordination. Names of substantially involved staff and an annual summary of staff involvement should be documented in the official files.

CTSA program staff documented a comparison of accomplishments to research objectives for only 1 of 38 awardees throughout our review period. Although reviews for six awardees' files mentioned an inability to fulfill goals, only one file included a note from CTSA program staff regarding resolution. Also, most progress reports and half of financial status reports were late, yet the files contained no evidence that CTSA program staff took action to address timeliness of reports. CTSA program staff did not maintain files in accordance with HHS policy. Finally, no files contained evidence that CTSA program staff provided substantial involvement to awardees in accordance with Federal requirements and NIH policy.

We recommend that NIH ensure that CTSA program staff (1) document their monitoring of awardee progress; (2) ensure timely submission of required reports; (3) maintain official files in accordance with Federal policy; and (4) as required for cooperative agreements, provide substantial involvement to CTSA awardees. NIH concurred with our recommendations.

There are many definitions of co-production. One technical definition is that '''Co-production''' is where technical experts and other groups co-generate new knowledge and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Christenson. ''The Co-production of Archaeological Knowledge: The 	Essential Relationship of Amateurs and Professionals in 20th Century American Archaeology. Complutum (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) 24(2): 63-72, 2013 https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CMPL/article/view/43367&lt;/ref&gt; It is the dynamic interaction between [[technology and society]]. It has a long history, particularly arising out of radical theories of knowledge in the 1970s.

==Description==
Co-production forms part of [[Mode 2]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gibbons, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott and Martin Trow ''The New Production of Knowledge: The dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies'' Sage. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. ''States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order''.  Routledge.  2004. {{ISBN|978-0-415-40329-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbers, Hans. ''Inside the Politics of Technology: Agency and Normativity in the Co-Production of Technology and Society''.  Amsterdam University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|978-90-5356-756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term used in the [[sociology of science]] to describe one of the modes, or ways that knowledge is formed. In [[Mode 2]], science and technology studies the move from extreme [[technological determinism]] and [[social constructivism]], to a more systemic understanding of how technology and society ‘co-produce’ each other. Co-production is functionally comparable to the concepts of [[causality loop]], [[positive feedback]], and [[co-evolution]] – all of which describe how two or more variables of a system affect and essentially create each other, albeit with respect to different variables operating at different scales. And as with these other concepts, if used too broadly/uncritically, co-production risks [[noetic flatness]] – if technology and society co-produce each other equally, the justification for maintaining the boundary between them dissolves (in which case [[actor-network theory]] may be invoked). Unless overlapping sets of [[boundary-work]] are employed, co-production may also fail to account for power differentials within each variable, (in this case, within technology and society).

==Science, technology and society==
From a more [[Science, technology and society|STS]] perspective, [[Sheila Jasanoff]], has written that "Co-production is shorthand for the proposition that the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we chose to live in." Co-production draws on constitutive (such as [[Actor–network theory]]) and interactional work ([[Leviathan and the Air-Pump|such as the Edinburgh School]]) in [[Science, technology and society|STS]].  As a sensitizing concept, the idiom of co-production looks at four themes: "the emergence and stabilization of new techno-scientific objects and framings, the resolution of scientific and technical controversies; the processes by which the products of techno-science are made intelligible and portable across boundaries; and the adjustment of science’s cultural practices in response to the contexts in which science is done."  Studies employing co-production often follow the following pathways: "making identities, making institutions, making discourses, and making representations"&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order. Routledge. 2004 http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic251437.files/Fall%202007%20papers/Jasanoff_papers/Jasanoff_States_of_Knowledge_Ch2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australian National Insect Collection - Buforaniidae - ZooKeys-209-147-g007.jpeg|thumb|Buforaniidae grasshoppers ([[Orthoptera]]) from the Australian National Insect Collection]]
The '''conservation and restoration of insect specimens''' is the process of caring for and preserving insects as a part of a collection. Conservation concerns begin at collection and continue through preparation, storage, examination, documentation, research and treatment when restoration is needed.

== Collection ==
[[File:Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay with Ernst Hackel 1866.jpg|left|thumb|261x261px]]
[[Insect collecting]] can be done in many different ways depending on the kind of insects being collected and from which habitats. Both hobbyists and professional entomologist have found particular ways to collect with minimal damage to their specimens. Following established techniques helps begin the conservation of insect specimens from the beginning by eliminating as much potential damage as possible. It must be done delicately to ensure that neither the collector nor the live insect itself will cause harm to the distinctive features such as wings, legs and antennae that give purpose to the collection. Special collection nets, traps and techniques must be utilized in consideration of how easily breakage can happen. A [[kill jar]] is often used to immediately immobilize the insect before it can damage itself.

== Preparation ==
The way an insect specimen is prepared is often the first step in their conservation. They have to be carefully prepared with the appropriate methods depending on their size, anatomy, and potentially delicate features to ensure they will not break before they begin their role as a specimen available for study, research and display. Some specimens must be prepared using a dry method and others with liquid to preserve. The choice made will preserve key features necessary for identification and represent the insect's living form as closely as possible.

=== Pinning ===
[[File:Neduba morsei, female, lateral view.jpg|thumb]]
The process of '''pinning''' insect specimens is a dry method to preserve and display collections and requires special [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|entomological equipment]] to accomplish effectively. It is used primarily for hard-bodied, medium to large specimens and is beneficial for easier study and color preservation. Flies and butterflies, though they are partially soft-bodied, are also best preserved through pinning because when preserved in fluid their hairs and/or scales will either clot or fall off.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 20 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Some smaller specimens may still be pinned use minuten pins, which are much thinner, to avoid breakage. Insects are pinned on foam block or specialized pinning blocks that provide support for the limbs while drying and may be moved to another specialized, protected display case after they have dried completely, at which point they will be more brittle. The pin is most often driven through the thorax of the insect just to the right of the mid-line to preserve the appearance of at least one side should any damage occur from pinning. The exception is butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies, which are pinned through the middle of the thorax.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Enough of the pin must be left both above and below the specimen to allow for labeling below and handling.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StagedandCardedInsects.jpg|left|thumb]]

=== Carding ===
'''Carding''' is used when pinning would destroy too much of the specimen because its size is quite small.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; A triangular point is cut from acid free card to ensure best conservation practice because it comes in direct contact with the specimen. A pin is then driven through the broad side of the point for mounting. A soluble glue that can be removed with solvents when necessary is used to adhere the right side of the thorax of the specimen to the point opposite the pinned side. The point is sometimes bent to allow the specimen to present in the same position as normally pinned specimens.

=== Wet specimen ===
A '''wet specimen''' is a specimen preserved in fluid, often 70% alcohol. Specimens that would receive this preservation technique are usually soft-bodied, such as caterpillars, larva, and spiders because of their soft abdomens. This is done to minimize shriveling allowing the identifying characteristics to be preserved as true to life as possible. Hard-bodied insects may also be preserved temporarily in alcohol before pinning.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slides ===
Slides of very small insects are also kept as part of insect collections.

== Core aspects of conservation ==
The [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) describes in their [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice.pdf?sfvrsn=9 Code of Ethics] the aspects of conservation to include: preventive conservation, examination, documentation, treatment, research and education. Each of these areas also apply to the conservation and restoration of insect specimens.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Insect collections may suffer multiple types of degradation including fading colors from light exposure, mold growth from improper humidity and temperature levels, and infestations from pests that feed on dried insect,&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M Agrilife Extension, (n.d.) [http://bughunter.tamu.edu/preservation/preservationconsider/ Bug hunter: Preservation considerations] Retrieved 2017-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; but much of this is avoidable when proper [[preventive conservation]] practices are followed.

==== Routine cleaning ====
In addition to maintaining a clean storage environment for specimens, it is sometimes necessary to clean the specimens themselves. Cleaning incredibly delicate and brittle dry insect specimens is done carefully and methodically. The conservator chooses the appropriate method based on the kind of insect that needs cleaning and how robust it is. Cleaning tools vary widely, but generally clean watercolor brushes are used to gently dust the specimens, sometimes with a [[stereo microscope]] for very small specimens, warm water and/or alcohol baths used with or without an ultrasonic cleaner, and lens blowers to gently blow away dust, or dry the specimen after a cleansing bath.&lt;ref&gt;Ingles-LeNobel, Johan, J. (March, 2017). [http://extreme-macro.co.uk/cleaning-insects/ How to clean insects] Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proper storage ====
A common way to prevent damage from pests intent to feed on insect specimens and dust accumulation in a collection is to keep them in sealed boxes or cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; When properly sealed, they can also aid in preventing damages cause by [[relative humidity]] (RH)  and temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Szczepanowska, H., Shockley, F., Furth, D. G., Gentile, P., Bell, D., DePriest, P. T., Mecklenburg, M., Hawks, C. Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections. (2013). Effectiveness of entomological collection storage cabinets in maintaining stable relative humidity and temperature in a historic museum building. ''Collection Forum, 27(1-2),'' 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Wet specimens are kept in separate vials or jars and in a secure cabinet, tray or shelf. Fluid levels are regularly monitored to ensure specimens are completely immersed in fluid, though a well-sealed jar or vial will prevent excessive evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safe handling ====
Proper handling for insect specimens prevents the excessive breaking of legs, antennae and other body parts that could then easily be lost. Curved forceps may be used to allow more precision and less chance of the brittle specimen coming in contact with the handler. The handler picks up the specimen by the pin, which is placed with enough space below the specimen for the handler to put in the pinning block and enough space above to grip without touching the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 11080 Tribolium destructor False black flour beetle.jpg|thumb|156x156px|The flour beetle, a common pest affecting dried insect specimens.]]

==== Integrated pest management ====
'''[[Integrated Pest Management (for museums)|Integrated pest management]]''' (IPM) is a specialized modern pest control used in museums.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R. A., &amp; Allman Gilmore, J. (2010). ''Museum registration methods 5th edition''. Washington, DC: The AAM Press&lt;/ref&gt; All IPM systems begin with regular sanitation and  monitoring of collections to detect castings from various pests, and checking insect traps laid out to capture and identify which pests are present. Some pests, such as carpet beetles and flour beetles, feed on dried insects.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 27 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; When an infestation is present, treatment may be necessary. Freezing is commonly used to rid insect collections of pests.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conservation Institute, (1997), [https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/ccinotesicc/3-3_e.pdf Controlling insect pests with low temperature] ''CCI Notes'' Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[inert gases]] may be used for an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] [[fumigation]] - depriving the pests of oxygen to exterminate, and in extreme cases chemical fumigation proven to be safe for collections and people may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examination  ===
[[File:Isoparce cupressi sjh.JPG|left|thumb|322x322px|Verdigris is present near the pin and an antennae is missing.]]
Assessing the condition of an insect collection is done regularly and the results are recorded accordingly. The conservator observes the specimens in high detail remarking all areas of damage, or altered states of the specimen. Tools used during this process may include a strong light source, magnifying glass and handling tools that allow the conservator to pick up the specimen from the pin without touching it. The observations made during the examination process result in the conclusions drawn for a treatment plan if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, B. (2010). ''Conservation treatment methodology.'' San Bernardino, CA. {{ISBN|1453682112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservator is knowledgeable of the kinds of deterioration to look for specific to insect specimens.

==== Common agents of deterioration ====
* Pests - Evidence of pests are recognized in castings of insects, their droppings or the damages they have caused from chewing on specimens.
* Mold - Mold is most likely to grow when humidity is high. 
* Verdigris - A blue-green hair-like crystallization caused by reaction to copper and brass entomological pins and the fats from the insects internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentation ===
The documentation of insect specimens is carried out in many different aspects of a specimen's existence. Documented information begins with the capture of an insect. The collector records information about capture method, place and date of capture and any relevant habitat information in field notes. This information is then transferred to labels and collection records. The documentation path then continues with every recorded observation or treatment the specimen receives. Killing agents, preservation agents, rehydrating agents, and fumigants are all important to record.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; This then informs any future decisions for conservation actions.

==== Labeling ====
As a minimum, labels contain the place and date of collection, and the identification of genus and species. On pinned insects, the labels are likewise pinned with the space left under the specimen on the same pin.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways to write the information on labels, but an ink that will not fade or come off in liquid is generally used. The paper is ideally 100% cotton or linen rag to avoid yellowing or embrittlement of the paper as it ages.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 3289 A pinned Australian sheep blowfly.jpg|left|thumb|145x145px]]

==== Photographing and digitization ====
With improvements in [[digital photography]] and web resources, many natural history museums have begun a new kind of documentation through digitization, bringing high quality images and associated information to anyone with access to the Internet. Large databases can hold vast amounts of information improving research efforts.

[[File:Odonata aeshnidae adult.jpg|thumb|Pen and ink scientific illustration of a dragonfly.]]

==== Illustrating ====
[[Scientific illustration]] of insects is an older technique used to preserve information about collected insects. It visually documents insects, and unlike photography, can add intellectual ideas about anatomy and behavior of the insect through artists' renditions. Scientifically informed observation of specimens combined with technical and aesthetic skill yields the highly detailed illustrations necessary for the documentation of each species that is illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, E. R. S. (2003). ''The guild handbook of scientific illustration: Second edition.'' Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Description of the state of the specimen and treatments ====
This area of insect specimen documentation comes after the close examination of specimens by conservators. The conservator records all of the visual information about the specimen that can be gleaned from detailed inspection. Conclusions are drawn from inspection and potential treatments are also documented to inform researchers and future conservators. 
[[File:Life cycle of ticks family ixodidae.PNG|thumb|Researching ticks helps develop health guidelines against the diseases they spread.]]

=== Research ===
Researching the collections of insects provides important information that develops knowledge about ecology, human health and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Well-kept records aid the researcher in identifying whether there are differences in an observed specimen because of damages, treatments or deterioration. Research of the insect collections in museums can lead to new discoveries of species,&lt;ref&gt;Entomology Today, July, 2106, [https://entomologytoday.org/2016/07/12/new-assassin-bug-species-discovered-in-museum-collections-and-in-the-field/ New assassin bug species discovered in museum collections and in the field] ''Entomology Today'' Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; and provide an important historical resource.&lt;ref&gt;Entomological Society of America, Jan. 2016, [http://www.entsoc.org/PDF/2016/ESA-PolicyStatement-EntomologicalCollections.pdf ESA position statement on the importance of entomological collections] Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment === 
Once a close observation reveals what issues are present in insect collections, the conservator makes a decision on actions to be taken. It is highly preferable that any treatment applied be reversible or done with little risk to the specimen. For example, broken limbs may be glued back on, which has traditionally been done with white glue. The advantage to white glue being that it is removable in warm water.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Another common problem is pest infestation. When dried insect collections have suffered an infestation, the affected specimens can be frozen or sealed with inert gases to kill the pests without harming the specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatments might include simply refilling wet specimens' jars with alcohol to ensure the specimens are completely submerged, cleaning specimens of dust and debris, or repositioning specimens for display or research. In the case that a specimen needs to be repositioned, the conservator will "relax" the specimen in a jar with a rehydrating substrate to move the limbs without breaking them. The technique used will vary among conservators. Some use a relaxing jar that the specimen is left in for days with the substrate of choice, others may choose to use a warm water bath with a drop of detergent. Whatever treatments are used are diligently documented.

=== Education ===
Conservation of insect specimens is done in large part to preserve the information for the public. The display of collections in museums and their interpretation offer one avenue that accomplishes this effort. However, websites offer a unique opportunity to disseminate information to a broad audience with layers of information to give general information or to provide depth where desired. These websites are often also provided by museums and their collections. Below is a list of some major educational endeavors with interests in insect specimens.

==History==
The journal was established in 2002 by [[Claude Fischer]] and  is published by [[SAGE Publications]]; until 2011, it was published by the [[University of California Press]]. Fischer was succeeded by [[Jeff Goodwin]] and [[James M. Jasper]], who edited the journal from 2005 to 2007, injecting a certain amount of controversial humor such as [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] cartoons and a column written by "Harry Green" (actually Jasper) called "The Fool." The current editors are Syed Ali and [[Philip N. Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/septoct14/contexts_0914.html "The ''Contexts'' Editors Bring Energy and Experience with Public Engagement," ASA Footnotes article.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The journal differs from a typical academic journal as it is targeted more toward students and the general public. It is used widely in courses,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}, and a selection of its premier articles is available in book format through ''The Contexts Reader,'' published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], now in its second edition.

The new editors have introduced a blog feature on the magazines website, Contexts.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contexts.org Contexts.org website]&lt;/ref&gt;

New print issues are published quarterly in February (Winter), May (Spring), August (Summer) and November (Fall).

==Awards==
''Contexts'' won the Best Journal Award in the Social Sciences (2003) by Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the [[Association of American Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/footnotes/feb03/indexone.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Articles and Interviews==
One of the most notable articles in ''Contexts'' is [[Ann Morning]]'s interview with [[Rachel Doležal]]. The interview has aired on many TV news networks, such as [[Fox News]], [[BBC]], and [[USA Today]], over the possibility of a trans-racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://contexts.org/blog/race-and-rachel-dolezal-an-interview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic journal ranges in topics from [[social mobility]], [[immigration]], [[race (human categorization)|race]] (particularly its role in [[Get Out]]), [[Donald Trump]]'s potential border wall, and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://contexts.org Contexts.org website]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the board members for ''Contexts'', [[Tressie McMillan Cottom]], appeared on [[The Daily Show]] with [[Trevor Noah]] to discuss the impact of [[for-profit higher education in the United States]] on disadvantaged students.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For investigation of the [[Curing_(chemistry)|curing]] behavior of [[Thermosetting polymer|thermosetting resin]] systems, composite materials, [[adhesive]]s and [[paint]]s, Dielectric Analysis (DEA) can be used in accordance with [[ASTM International|ASTM]] E 2038 or E 2039. The great advantage of DEA is that it can be employed not only on a laboratory scale, but also in process.

==Measuring principle==

In a typical test, the sample is placed in contact with two electrodes (the [[Capacitance probe|dielectric sensor]]) and a sinusoidal voltage (the excitation) is applied to one electrode.&lt;ref name="brown2001"&gt;{{Cite book

| date = 2001-12-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  resulting sinusoidal current (the response) is measured at the second electrode. The response signal is attenuated in amplitude and shifted in phase in relation to the mobility of the ions and alignment of the dipoles. Dipoles in the material will attempt to align with the electric field and ions (present as impurities) will move toward the electrode of opposite polarity. The dielectric properties of [[permittivity]] ε' and loss factor ε" are then calculated from this measured amplitude and phase change.&lt;ref name="brown2001"/&gt;

'''Dryad''' is an international [[disciplinary repository]] of data underlying scientific and medical publications. Dryad is a curated general-purpose repository that makes data discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. The scientific, educational, and charitable mission of Dryad is to promote the availability of data underlying findings in the scientific literature for research and educational reuse.

The vision of Dryad is a scholarly communication system in which learned societies, publishers, institutions of research and education, funding bodies and other stakeholders collaboratively sustain and promote the preservation and reuse of data underlying the scholarly literature.

Dryad aims to allow researchers to validate published findings, explore new analysis methodologies, re-purpose data for research questions unanticipated by the original authors, and perform synthetic studies such as formal meta-analyses.  For many publications, existing data repositories do not capture the whole data package. As a result, many important datasets are not being preserved and are no longer available, or usable, at the time that they are sought by later investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Vision, T.J. (2010) Open Data and the Social Contract of Scientific Publishing. BioScience 60(5):330-330. {{doi|10.1525/bio.2010.60.5.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryad serves as a repository for tables, spreadsheets, flat files, and all other kinds of published data for which specialized repositories do not already exist.  Optimally, authors submit data to Dryad in conjunction with article publication, so that links to the data can be included in the published article.  All data files in Dryad are associated with a published article, and are made available for reuse under the terms of a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Zero]] waiver.

Dryad is also a non-profit membership organization registered in the US, providing a forum for all stakeholders to set priorities for the repository, participate in planning, and share knowledge and coordinate action around data policies.

Dryad is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dryad Entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100000044|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Dryad enables authors, journals, societies and publishers to facilitate data archiving at the time of publication, when the data are readily available.  Data in Dryad receives a permanent, unique [[Digital object identifier]] (DOI), which can be included in the published article so that readers are able to access the data.   Authors can archive data in Dryad and be assured of its preservation, while satisfying journals' and research funding agencies' mandates to disseminate their research outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Data Archiving. Michael C. Whitlock, Mark A. McPeek, Mark D. Rausher, Loren Rieseberg and Allen J. Moore, The American Naturalist, Vol. 175, No. 2 (February 2010), pp. 145-146 {{doi|10.1086/650340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors submit data to Dryad either when the associated article is under review or has been accepted for publication.  The choice depends on whether the journal includes data within the scope of peer reviewer.  Authors may also submit data after an article has been published.

Data submission is facilitated by journals sending notices of new manuscripts to Dryad.  This saves authors from having to re-enter the bibliographic details when they upload their data files.

Dryad curators review submitted data files and perform quality control on metadata descriptions before inclusion of new content in the repository. Dryad’s metadata approach emphasizes simplicity and interoperability, supported by a [[Dublin Core]] metadata [[application profile]]. The [http://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/ Metadata Research Center] now at the [http://cci.drexel.edu College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University], serves as Dryad’s central curation hub, with curation activity also taking place via the non-profit in North Carolina. &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, J., White, H., C, Carrier, C. and Scherle, R. (2009). A Metadata Best Practice for a Scientific Data Repository. Journal of Library Metadata, 9:3, 194—212. {{doi|10.1080/19386380903405090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryad coordinates data submission to specialized repositories where in order to (a) lower user burden by streamlining the submission workflow and (b) allow Dryad and specialized repositories to exchange identifiers and other metadata in order to enable cross-referencing of the different data products associated with a given publication.  The first two handshaking partners are TreeBASE and [[GenBank]], which Dryad's partner journals have previously identified as required points of deposition for phylogenetic tree data and DNA sequences, respectively.

==Governance, history and funding==

Dryad is governed by a twelve-member [[Board of Directors]], elected by its Members. Members may be independent journals, societies, publishers, research and educational institutions, libraries, funders, or other organizations that support Dryad's mission. The organization coordinates data sharing policies and promotes the long-term sustainability of the repository.

Dryad began charging submission fees in September 2013.  Dryad is a nonprofit organization that provides long-term access to its contents at no cost to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to data due to financial support from members and data submitters. Dryad’s submission fees are designed to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving data.

Dryad emerged from a [[National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent)]] workshop entitled "Digital data preservation, sharing, and discovery: Challenges for Small Science Communities in the Digital Era" in May 2007.  Initial funding for Dryad was provided by the [[National Science Foundation]] to the [[National Evolutionary Synthesis Center]] and other partners in the US.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708122322/http://datadryad.org/dryaduk DryadUK] was a [[Jisc]]-funded project run from the [[British Library]] and the [[University of Oxford]], in partnership with NESCent, the [[Digital Curation Centre]], and Charles Beagrie Ltd.  The project led to a UK mirror of the Dryad repository based at the British Library.  The project also improved the tools available for the publication and citation of data, expanded the disciplinary range of participating journals, and further developed the business framework for an international organization dedicated to long-term data preservation.

Dryad is a member of the Data Observation Network for Earth ([[DataONE]]).

==Software==
Dryad is built upon the open source [[DSpace]] repository software, developed by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Many customizations have been integrated into the main DSpace codebase; customizations specific to Dryad are maintained in the open source Dryad code repository.

'''Edgar Cayce''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|iː}}; March 18, 1877&amp;nbsp;– January 3, 1945) was an American [[clairvoyant]] who answered questions on subjects as varied as [[healing]], reincarnation, wars, [[Atlantis]], and future events while claiming to be in a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].  A biographer gave him the nickname, '''The Sleeping Prophet'''. A nonprofit organization, the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]],&lt;ref name='ARE About/Mission'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx?id=1036 | title = About A.R.E. and Our Mission | accessdate = December 18, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded to facilitate the study of Cayce's work.

Some consider him the true founder and a principal source of the most characteristic beliefs of the [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Emerging Network: A Sociology of the New Age and Neo-Pagan Movements |first=Michael |last=York |year=1995 |page=60 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8476-8001-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce is also notable for his contributions to the notions of diet and health, particularly the issues of [[food combining]], [[acid/alkaline diet]], and the [[Food therapy|therapeutic use of food]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Edgar Cayce was born on March 18, 1877, near [[Beverly, Kentucky|Beverly]], south of [[Hopkinsville]], [[Kentucky]]. He was one of six children of [[farmers]] Carrie Elizabeth (née Major)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88291563/carrie-elizabeth-cayce|title=Carrie Elizabeth Major Cayce (1855-1927) - Find A...|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leslie Burr Cayce.&lt;ref name='ARE Chronology'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx?id=1971 | title = Chronology | accessdate = December 18, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, he played with the 'little folk'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=There Is a River|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|publisher=A.R.E. Press (50th Anniversary edition)|year=1942|isbn=0876042353|location=Virginia Beach, VA|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was alleged to have seen his deceased grandfather. He regarded them all as incorporeal because he could see through them if he looked hard enough.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  However, he found it very difficult to keep his mind on his lessons at school.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 35–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was taken to church when he was 10, and from then he read the Bible, becoming engrossed, and completing a dozen readings by the time he was 12.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In May 1889, while reading the Bible in his hut in the woods, he 'saw' a woman with wings who told him that his prayers were answered, and asked him what he wanted most of all. He was frightened, but he said that most of all he wanted to help others, especially sick children.  He decided he would like to be a missionary.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 41–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next night, after a complaint from the school teacher, his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling, eventually knocking him out of his chair with exasperation.  At that point, Cayce 'heard' the voice of the lady who had appeared the day before.  She told him that if he could sleep a little 'they' could help him.  He begged for a rest and put his head on the spelling book.  When his father came back into the room and woke him up, he knew all the answers.  In fact, he could repeat anything in the book.  His father thought he had been fooling before and knocked him out of the chair again.  Eventually, Cayce used all his school books that way.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 46–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1892, the teacher regarded Cayce as his best student. On being questioned, Cayce told the teacher that he saw pictures of the pages in the books. His father became proud of this accomplishment and spread it around, resulting in Cayce becoming "different" from his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this, Cayce exhibited an ability to diagnose in his sleep.  He was struck on the base of the spine by a ball in a school game, after which he began to act very strangely, and eventually was put to bed. He went to sleep and diagnosed the cure, which his family prepared and which cured him as he slept.  His father boasted that his son was, "the greatest fellow in the world when he's asleep."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this ability was not demonstrated again for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce's uncommon personality is also shown in an unusual incident in which he rode a certain mule back to the farmhouse at the end of a work day.  This stunned everyone there, as the mule could not be ridden. The owner, thinking it may be time to break the animal in again, attempted to mount it but was immediately thrown off.  Cayce left for his family in the city that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1893 to 1912: Kentucky period===
{{Christian mysticism}}
In December 1893, the Cayce family moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and occupied 705 West Seventh on the southeast corner of Seventh and Young Streets. During this time, Cayce received an eighth-grade education, is said by the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]] to have developed psychic abilities,&lt;ref name='ARE Bio'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx | title = About Edgar Cayce | accessdate = December 19, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left the family farm to pursue various forms of employment.

Cayce's education stopped in the ninth grade because his family could not afford the costs involved.&lt;ref name="MM_13"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A ninth-grade education was often considered more than sufficient for working-class children. Much of the remainder of Cayce's younger years would be characterized by a search for both employment and money. On March 14, 1897, Cayce became engaged to Gertrude Evans.

Throughout his life, Cayce was drawn to church as a member of the Disciples of Christ. He read the [[Bible]] once a year every year, taught at [[Sunday school]],&lt;ref name="ARB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and recruited missionaries. He said he could see [[wikt:aura|aura]]s around people, spoke to angels, and heard voices of departed relatives. In his early years, he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=There Is a River|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|publisher=A.R.E. Press (50th Anniversary edition)|year=1942|isbn=0876042353|location=Virginia Beach, VA|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Cayce formed a business partnership with his father to sell [[Woodmen of the World]] [[Insurance]]; however, in March he was struck by severe [[laryngitis]] that resulted in a complete loss of speech.&lt;ref name="MM_13"/&gt; Unable to work, he lived at home with his parents for almost a year. He then decided to take up the trade of [[photography]], an occupation that would exert less strain on his voice. He began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of W. R. Bowles in Hopkinsville, and eventually became quite talented in his trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, a traveling stage [[hypnotist]] and entertainer named Hart, who referred to himself as "The Laugh Man", was performing at the Hopkinsville Opera House. Hart heard about Cayce's condition and offered to attempt a cure. Cayce accepted his offer, and the experiment was conducted in the office of Manning Brown, the local throat specialist. Cayce's voice allegedly returned while in a hypnotic trance but disappeared on awakening. Hart tried a posthypnotic suggestion that the voice would continue to function after the trance, but this proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="MM_14"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Hart had appointments at other cities, he could not continue his hypnotic treatments of Cayce, but admitted he had failed because Cayce would not go into the third stage of hypnosis to take a suggestion.  A New York hypnotist, Dr Quackenboss, found the same impediment but, after returning to New York, suggested that Cayce should be prompted to take over his own case while in the second stage of hypnosis. The only local hypnotist, Al Layne, offered to help Cayce restore his voice.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 116-120&lt;/ref&gt; Layne suggested that Cayce describe the nature of his condition and cure while in a hypnotic trance.&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; Cayce described his own ailment from a first-person plural point of view: "we" instead of the singular "I".&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; In subsequent sessions, when Cayce wanted to indicate that the connection was made to the "entity" of the person that was requesting the reading, he would generally start off with, "We have the body." According to the reading for the "entity" of Cayce, his voice loss was due to psychological paralysis, and could be corrected by increasing the blood flow to the voice box. Layne suggested that the blood flow be increased and Cayce's face supposedly became flushed with blood, and both his [[chest]] and [[throat]] turned bright red.&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; After 20 minutes, Cayce, still in a trance, declared the treatment over. On awakening, his voice was alleged to have remained normal. Apparently, relapses occurred, but were said to have been corrected by Layne in the same way, and eventually the cure was said to be permanent.

Layne had read of similar hypnotic cures by the [[Marquis de Puységur]], a follower of [[Franz Mesmer]], and was keen to explore the limits of the healing knowledge involved with the trance voice.&lt;ref name="MM_15"&gt;
{{Cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 123–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the [[newspaper]]s, which inspired many postal inquiries.&lt;ref name="MM_19"/&gt; Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and  location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed "the entity," and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him.  Few people knew what he was up to.  There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 125–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.

In May 1902 he got a bookshop job in the town of [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] where he boarded with some young professionals, two of whom were doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt;  He lost his voice while there and Layne came to help effect the normal cure, finally visiting every week.  Cayce, still worried, kept the meetings secret, and continued to refuse money for his readings.  He invented a card game called ''[[Pit (game)|Pit]]'' or ''Board of Trade'', simulating wheat market trading, that became popular, but when he sent the idea to a game company they copyrighted it and he got no returns. He still refused to give readings for money.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 134–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce and Gertrude Evans married on June 17, 1903, and she moved to Bowling Green with him. They had three children: Hugh Lynn Cayce (March 16, 1907 – July 4, 1982), Milton Porter Cayce (March 28, 1911 – May 17, 1911), and Edgar Evans Cayce (February 9, 1918 – February 15, 2013).&lt;ref name="ARE Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Virginian Pilot (obituaries) Feb 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She still disapproved of the readings, and Cayce still agonized over the morality of them.  A few days later Layne revealed the activity to the professionals at the boarding house, one of whom was a magistrate and journalist, after which state medical authorities forced Layne to close his practice. He left to acquire osteopathic qualifications in Franklin.  Cayce and Gertrude accepted the resulting publicity as best they could, greatly aided by the diplomacy of the young doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce and a relative opened a photographic studio in Bowling Green, while the doctors formed a committee with some colleagues to investigate the phenomenon, with Cayce’s co-operation. All the experiments confirmed the accuracy of the readings. However, Cayce refused a lucrative offer to go into business. After a violent examination by doctors while in a trance, Cayce refused any more investigations, declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 146–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 and 1907 fires burned down his two photographic studios, leading to bankruptcy.  Between the two fires, his first son was born on March 16, 1907. He became debt free by 1909, although completely broke, and ready to start again.  In 1907, outstanding diagnostic successes in the family helped his confidence. He again refused an offer to go into business, this time with homeopath Wesley H. Ketchum from Hopkinsville, who was introduced by his father.  He found a job at the H. P. Tresslar photography firm.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 161–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ketchum was persistent, spread information in various medical circles, and in October 1910 got written up in the press.  When a reporter contacted Cayce, he explained to the reporter that he somehow had the ability to easily go into the intuitive sleep when he wanted to, and this was different from how he went to sleep normally like everyone else. When asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method, they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 175–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ketchum again urged Cayce to join a business company. After soul searching the whole night, Cayce finally accepted the offer under certain conditions, including that he did not take money for the readings.  Instead the company was to furnish him with a photographic studio for his livelihood, and build a separate office for the readings. The contract was modified to give 50% of the earnings to Cayce and his father. Cayce read the back readings, but they contained so many technical terms that he gained no more understanding of what he was doing.  He preferred to put the readings on a more scientific basis, but only the doctors in Hopkinsville would cooperate, whereas most of the patients were not in that locality. Also, doctors from all specialties were needed as the treatments prescribed varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 180–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgar Cayce, and especially Gertrude, still did not give therapeutic priority to the readings and supposedly lost their second child due to this reticence. When Gertrude became fatally ill with tuberculosis, they used the readings after the doctor had given up. Miraculously, the treatment cured her. Shortly after this, in 1912, Cayce, whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings, discovered that Ketchum had not been honest about them, and had also used them to gamble for finance.  He argued in defense that the medical profession were not backing them. Cayce quit the company immediately and went back to the Tresslar photography firm in Selma, Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 191–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1912 to 1923: Selma, Alabama period===
[[File:Cayce Selma AL DCP 0924.JPG|thumb|right|Historic marker in downtown [[Selma, Alabama]], in front of the building where Cayce lived and worked from 1912 to 1923.]]

Cayce's work grew in volume as his fame grew. He asked for voluntary donations to support himself and his family so that he could practice full-time. To help raise money he invented [[Pit (game)|''Pit'']], a card game based on the commodities trading at the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], and the game is still sold today. He continued to work in an apparent trance state with a hypnotist all his life. His wife and eldest son later replaced Layne in this role. A secretary, Gladys Davis, recorded his readings in shorthand.&lt;ref name="MM_19"/&gt;

The growing fame of Cayce along with the popularity he received from newspapers attracted several eager commercially minded men who wanted to seek a fortune by using his clairvoyant abilities. Even though Cayce was reluctant to help them, he was persuaded to give his readings, which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful. A cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market; however, despite his poor finances, Cayce refused the merchant's offer.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Several times he was persuaded to give such readings as an experiment. However, when he used his ability for such purposes, he did no better than chance alone would dictate. These experiments allegedly left him depleted of energy, distraught, and unsatisfied with himself. Finally, he decided to use his gift only to help the distressed and sick.&lt;ref name="MM_19"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Arthur Lammers, a wealthy printer and student of metaphysics, persuaded Cayce to give readings on philosophical subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce was told by Lammers that, while in his trance state, he spoke of Lammers' past lives and of [[reincarnation]], something Lammers believed in. Reincarnation was a popular subject of the day but is not an accepted part of Christian doctrine. Because of this, Cayce questioned his stenographer about what he said in his trance state and remained unconvinced. He challenged Lammers' charge that he had validated astrology and reincarnation in the following dialogue:

:Cayce: I said all that?... I couldn't have said all that in one reading.
:Lammers: No. But you confirmed it. You see, I have been studying metaphysics for years, and I was able by a few questions, by the facts you gave, to check what is right and what is wrong with a whole lot of the stuff I've been reading. The important thing is that the basic system which runs through all the mystery religions, whether they come from Tibet or the pyramids of Egypt, is backed up by you. It's actually the right system.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cayce's stenographer recorded the following:

:In this we see the plan of development of those individuals set upon this plane, meaning the ability to enter again into the presence of the Creator and become a full part of that creation.
:Insofar as this entity is concerned, this is the third appearance on this plane, and before this one, as the monk. We see glimpses in the life of the entity now as were shown in the monk, in this mode of living. The body is only the vehicle ever of that spirit and soul that waft through all times and ever remain the same.

Cayce was quite unconvinced that he had been referring to the doctrine of reincarnation, and the best Lammers could offer was that the reading "opens up the door" and to go on to share his beliefs and knowledge with Cayce.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Lammers had come to him with quite a bit of information of his own to share with Cayce and seemed intent upon convincing Cayce now that he felt the reading had confirmed his strongly-held beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that 12 years earlier Cayce had briefly alluded to reincarnation. In reading 4841-1, given April 22, 1911, Cayce referred to the soul being "transmigrated." Because Cayce's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923, it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings.

=== 1923 to 1925: Dayton, Ohio period ===
Lammers asked Cayce to come to Dayton to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings.  Cayce eventually agreed and went to Dayton. Gertrude Cayce was dubious but interested. There, Cayce produced much metaphysical information, which Cayce tried to reconcile with Christianity. Lammers declared that the fifth chapter of Matthew was the constitution of Christianity and the Sermon on the Mount was its Declaration of Independence.  It appeared that Cayce's subconscious mind was as much at home with the language of metaphysics as it was with the language of anatomy and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 234–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce reported that his conscience bothered him severely over this conflict. His readings of reincarnations were going against his biblical teachings and at one point he wanted to cease his channeling sessions. Once again Cayce lost his voice and in a reading for himself he was informed if he was no longer going to be a channel, his mission in this life was complete. Ultimately his trance voice, the "we" of the readings, dialogued with Cayce and finally persuaded him to continue with these kinds of readings.&lt;ref name="MM_25"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Lammers wanted to ask the readings the purpose of Cayce's clairvoyance, and to put up money for an organisation supporting Cayce's healing methods.  Cayce decided to accept the work and  asked his family to join him in Dayton as soon as they could. But by the time the Cayces had arrived there, near the end of 1923, Lammers found himself in financial difficulties and could be of no use.  Cayce used his knowledge of the Bible to convince his family that it agreed with reincarnation and other metaphysical teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 243–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this time Cayce directed his activities to provide readings centred around health. The remedies that were channeled often involved the use of unusual electrotherapy, ultraviolet light, diet, massage, gemstones, less mental work and more relaxation in sand on the beach. His remedies were coming under the scrutiny of the American Medical Association and Cayce felt that it was time to legitimize the operations with the aid of licensed medical practitioners. In 1925 Cayce reported while in a trance, "the voice" had instructed him to move to [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; across the street from the beach. He was informed that the sand's crystals would have curative properties to promote rapid healing.

===1925 to 1945: Virginia Beach period===
[[File:Cayce Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|The Cayce Hospital 2006]]
Cayce's mature period, in which he created the several institutions that survived him, can be considered to have started in 1925. By this time he was a professional psychic with a small number of employees and volunteers.&lt;ref name="AAR"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The readings increasingly came to involve occult or esoteric themes.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, ch. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Money was extremely scarce, but help came from interested persons.  The idea of an association and a hospital was mooted again, but the readings insisted on Virginia Beach, not suiting most of the people. Gertrude Cayce began to conduct all the readings. Morton Blumenthal, a young man who worked in the stock exchange in New York with his trader brother, became very interested in the readings, shared Cayce's outlook, and offered to finance the vision in the right spirit. He bought them a house at Virginia Beach.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 267–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 1927, the Association of National Investigations was incorporated in the state of Virginia. This would manage building the hospital and a scientific study of the readings. Morton was president and his brother and several others were vice presidents. Cayce was secretary and treasurer, and Gladys was assistant secretary. To protect against legal prosecution, the rules required any person requesting a reading to become a member of the Association and agree they were participating in an experiment in psychic research.  Early in 1928, Dr Moseley Brown, head of the psychology dept at Washington and Lee University, became convinced of the readings and joined the Association.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 274–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 1928, the dedication ceremonies for the hospital complex were held.  It contained a lecture hall, library, vault for storage of the readings, and offices for research workers. There was also a large living room, a 12-car garage, servants quarters, and a tennis court. It contained "the largest lawn, in fact the only lawn, between the Cavalier and Cape Henry." The first patient was admitted the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 281–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This facility would enable consistent checking and rechecking of the remedies, which was Cayce's goal.  There were consistent remedies for many of the illnesses regardless of the patient, and Cayce hoped to produce a compendium that could be used by the medical profession.  A distinguished chemist, Dr Sunker A. Bisley, DPhil (Oxon), who also used psychic knowledge to produce medicines, collaborated with Cayce to produce [[Atomidine]], an absorbable form of iodine, which was perfected and sold.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 285–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic raison d'etre for all the cures was the "assimilation of needed properties through the digestive system, from food taken into the body… [All treatments, including all schools and types of treatment, were given in order to establish] the proper equilibrium of the assimilating system."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 290–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Therapies as divergent as salt packs, poultices, hot compresses, [[Chromotherapy|color healing]], magnetism, vibrator treatment, massage, osteopathic manipulation, dental therapy, colonics, enemas, antiseptics, inhalants, homeopathics, essential oils, mud baths were prescribed.  Substances used included oils, salts, herbs, iodine, witch hazel, magnesia, bismuth, alcohol, castoria, lactated pepsin, turpentine, charcoal, animated ash, soda, cream of tartar, aconite, laudanum, camphor, and gold solution.  These were prescribed to overcome conditions that prevented proper digestion and assimilation of needed nutrients from the prescribed diet. The aim of the readings was to produce a healthy body, removing the cause of the specific ailment.  Readings would indicate if the patient's recovery was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 290–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a waiting list of months ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 295, 300.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Blumenthal and Brown went ahead with ambitious plans for a university as a supplement to the hospital and a "parallel service for the mind and spirit".  In fact, it was to dwarf the hospital and rival other universities in respectability before psychic studies would begin. It was to open on September 22, 1930.   On September 16 Blumenthal  called a meeting of the Association resulting in his ownership of the hospital to curb expenses.  After the first semester he ceased his support of the university, and on February 26, 1931, closed down the Association.  Cayce removed the files of the readings from the hospital and took them home.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 306–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression|Depression]] years saw Cayce turn his attention to spiritual teachings. In 1931, Edgar Cayce's friends and family asked him how they could become psychic like him. Out of this seemingly simple question came an eleven-year discourse that led to the creation of  "Study Groups". From his altered state, Cayce relayed to this group that the purpose of life is not to become psychic, but to become a more spiritually aware and loving person. Study Group #1 was told that they could "bring light to a waiting world" and that these lessons would still be studied a hundred years into the future. The readings were now about dreams, coincidence (synchronicity), developing intuition, karma, the akashic records, astrology, past-life relationships, soul mates and other esoteric subjects. Hundreds of books have been published about these readings.

June 6, 1931, 61 people attended a meeting to carry on the work and form a new organization called the Association for Research and Enlightenment. In July the new association was incorporated, and Cayce legally returned the house to Blumenthal and bought another place.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 317–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Lynn proposed that they develop a stock in trade rather than something  grandiose, and that they build a library of research into the phenomena and hold study groups, and that Cayce would do two readings a day. The association accepted this, and Hugh Lynn also started a monthly bulletin for association members. The bulletin contained readings on general interest subjects, interesting cases, book reviews on psychic subjects, health hints from readings, and news of psychic phenomena in other fields.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 324–328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Lynn narrowed the mailing list to some 300 members who were genuinely enthusiastic, and as a result the first annual congress of the association was held in June 1932.  He procured speakers on various metaphysical and psychic subjects and included public readings by Cayce.  Members left the conference eager to start study groups in their own localities.   Records were kept of everything that went on in the readings including the attitudes and routines of Cayce. Everything was then checked with the subjects of the readings, most of whom were not present during the reading, and the data was published in a study entitled "100 cases of clairvoyance."   However, the response from scientists in general was that none of the experiments were performed under test conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 330–333.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hugh Lynn continued to build files of case histories, parallel studies in psychic phenomena, and research readings for the study groups.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Association activities remained simple and un-publicized.  Members raised a building fund for an office, library, and vault, which they erected in 1940-1 as a single unit added on to the Cayce residence.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 346–7, 354&lt;/ref&gt;  No sign guided visitors to the centre.  Association membership averaged 500 to 600. The turnover from year to year was approximately half this total.  The other half remained a solid basis for the research work, an audience for case studies, pamphlets, bulletins—and the Congress bulletin, which was a yearbook and record of congress events. A mailing list of several thousand served people who remained interested in Cayce's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 346–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Members were drawn from all of the Protestant churches: from the Roman, Greek, Syrian and Armenian Catholic churches; from Theosophy, Christian Science and Spiritualism; and from many Oriental religions.  Cayce's philosophy was, if it makes you a better member of your church then it's good; if it takes you away from your church, it's bad.  The philosophy of the readings was that truth is one, each organization is part of this one, therefore the A.R.E. was not to function as a schism or in opposition to any religious organization.  The goal of the work was not something new but something ancient and universal.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 348–350.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Both sons entered the forces during the war.  They both married, Hugh Lynn in 1941 and Edgar Evans in 1942.&lt;ref name="Sugrue 2003, p. 355"&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In March 1943 the first edition of the only biography written during Cayce's lifetime, by Thomas Sugrue, was published.  As a consequence, public demand increased. Office staff had to be increased, and the mailman could no longer carry all the mail so Gertrude got it from the post office by car.  Hugh Lynn was away in the forces, and Cayce coped with the letters and increased his readings to four to six per day.&lt;ref name="Sugrue 2003, p. 355"/&gt;

Cayce gained national prominence in 1943 after the publication of a high-profile article in the magazine ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'' titled "Miracle Man of Virginia Beach".&lt;ref name="AAR"/&gt; [[World War II]] was taking its toll on American soldiers and he felt he could not refuse the families who requested help for their loved ones who were missing in action. He increased the frequency of his readings to eight per day to try to make an impression on the ever-growing pile of requests. He said this took a toll on his health as it was emotionally draining and often fatigued him. The readings themselves scolded him for attempting too much and that he should limit his workload to just two life readings a day or else these good efforts would eventually kill him.&lt;ref&gt;

From June 1943 to June 1944, 1,385 readings were taken.  By August 1944 Cayce collapsed from strain.  When he gave a reading on this situation, the instructions were to rest until he was well or dead. He and Gertrude went away to the mountains of Virginia, but in September Edgar Cayce suffered a [[stroke]] at the age of 67, in September 1944, and died on January 3, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;

After the death of Cayce the Association continued the work of classifying and cross referring the over 14,000 files of readings that had been taken throughout Cayce's lifetime from March 31, 1901, to September 17, 1944. The results of these have been disseminated through the Associations publications with the members as the recipients of this material.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 356–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims for psychic abilities==

Until September 1923, his readings were not systematically recorded or preserved. However, an article published in the ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' on October 10, 1922, quotes Cayce as saying that he had given 8,056 readings as of that date and it is known that he gave approximately 13,000–14,000 readings after that date. A total of 14,306 are available at the A.R.E. Cayce headquarters in Virginia Beach and on an online member-only section along with background information, correspondence, and follow-up documentation.&lt;ref&gt;EdgarCayce.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Other abilities that have been attributed to Cayce include [[astral projection]], [[prophecy|prophesying]], [[mediumship]], viewing the [[Akashic records]] or "[[Book of Life]]", and seeing [[aura (paranormal)|aura]]s. Cayce said he became interested in learning more about these subjects after he was informed about the content of his readings, which he reported that he never actually heard himself.&lt;ref&gt;Bro, Harmon Hartzell. ''Edgar Cayce: A Seer out of Season'', Aquarian Press, London, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters==
Cayce's clients included a number of famous people such as [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Irving Berlin]], and [[George Gershwin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edgar Cayce: an American prophet'', Sidney Kirkpatrick, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gina Cerminara]] published books such as ''Many Mansions'' and ''The World Within''. [[Brian Weiss]] published a bestseller regarding clinical recollection of past lives, ''Many Lives, Many Masters''. These books provide broad support for [[spiritualism]] and reincarnation. ''Many Mansions'' elaborates on Cayce's work and supports his stated abilities with real life examples.

In 1971 Edgar Cayce's sons Edgar Evans Cayce and Hugh Lynn Cayce published a book titled ''The Outer Limits of Edgar Cayce's Power'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/148598|title=The outer limits of Edgar Cayce's power|last=Evans.|first=Cayce, Edgar|others=Cayce, Hugh Lynn,|isbn=1931044686|edition= First|location=New York|oclc=148598}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming Cayce's readings had an approximate 85% success rate. The majority of the book investigated cases where Cayce's readings were demonstrably incorrect.

He practiced medicine in Hopkinsville until 1912.  In 1913 he traveled across country to San Francisco, and took passage to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he opened a new practice.  He returned to California in 1918, and established an office in Palo Alto California, practicing medicine there until the 1950s.  He retired to Southern California around 1963, settling in San Marino, just outside Pasadena.  He died on November 28, 1968, in Canoga Park, California.

He wrote ''The Discovery of Edgar Cayce'', published by the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment|A.R.E. Press]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/discovery-of-edgar-cayce/oclc/3537711 |title=The discovery of Edgar Cayce, (Book, 1964) |publisher=[WorldCat.org] |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism== &lt;!-- This section is referenced in [[Atomidine]] article, if you change the title please change the link --&gt;

===Controversy===
Cayce advocated some controversial ideas in his trance readings. In many trance sessions, he interpreted the history of life on Earth. One of Cayce's controversial claims was that of [[polygenism]]. According to Cayce, five human races (white, black, red, brown, and yellow) had been created separately but simultaneously on different parts of the Earth. Cayce also accepted the existence of aliens and [[Atlantis]], and claimed that "the red race developed in Atlantis and its development was rapid." Another claim by Cayce was that "soul-entities" on Earth intermingled with animals to produce "things": giants that were as much as twelve feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;Orser, Charles E. (2004). ''Race and Practice in Archaeological Interpretation''. p. 68. University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-3750-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Olav Hammer]] wrote that many of Cayce's readings discussed race and skin color and that the explanation for this is that Cayce was not a racist but was influenced by the occult ideas of [[Helena Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Olav Hammer|Hammer, Olav]]. (2001). ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age''. Brill Academic Publishing. p. 114 and the footnote at the bottom of the page. {{ISBN|978-9004120167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce declared that the [[Piltdown man]] was genuine, claiming he was an Atlantean colonizer who had travelled to Britain.&lt;ref name="Fagan 2002"&gt;Fagan, Garrett G. (2002). ''Alternative Archaeology''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC--CLIO. pp. 9-16. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Piltdown man was exposed as a [[hoax]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Fagan 2002"/&gt;

Philosopher and skeptic [[Robert Todd Carroll]], in his book ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', wrote, "Cayce is one of the main people responsible for some of the sillier notions about Atlantis." Carroll mentioned some of Cayce's ideas, including his belief in a giant solar crystal, activated by the sun, and used to harness energy and provide power on Atlantis, and his prediction that in 1958, the United States would rediscover a death ray that had been used on Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert Todd]]. (2003). ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''. Wiley. p. 69. {{ISBN|0-471-27242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930s, Cayce also incorrectly predicted that  North America would experience chaos: "Los Angeles, San Francisco... will be among those that will be destroyed before New York". These events were to have happened "in the period of '58 to '98".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/profecias/esp_profecia01h4.htm|title=American Prophecy - 4|website=www.bibliotecapleyades.net|access-date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

Skeptics challenge Cayce's alleged [[psychic]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |first=Martin |last=Gardner |authorlink=Martin Gardner |year=1957 |pages=216–219 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Randi |authorlink=James Randi |year=1982 |title=[[The Truth About Uri Geller]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |page=195 |isbn=0-87975-199-1 |quote=The matter of Edgar Cayce boils down to a vague mass of garbled data, interpreted by true believers who have a very heavy stake in the acceptance of the claims.

(1990). ''HealthSmarts: How to Spot the Quacks, Avoid the Nonsense, and Get the Facts that Affect Your Health''. Health Facts Publishing. p. 7. {{ISBN|978-0962614507}} "Some quacks, such as Edgar Cayce, attributed their powers to God. Cayce, who made his diagnoses while in trance, claimed that his healing powers came from God. To treat patients he used spinal manipulation as well as Red Bug Juice and Oil of Smoke in his cures."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raso, Jack. [http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/cayce.html ''The Legacies of Edgar Cayce'']. Quackwatch. Retrieved January 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writers and [[Skepticism|skeptics]] have suggested that the evidence for Cayce's alleged psychic powers comes from contemporaneous [[newspaper]] articles, affidavits, anecdotes, testimonials, and books. [[Martin Gardner]], for example, wrote that while Cayce's [[trance]]s did happen, most of the information from his trances was derived from books that Cayce had been reading by authors such as [[Carl Jung]], [[P. D. Ouspensky]], and [[Helena Blavatsky]]. Gardner's hypothesis was that the trance readings of Cayce contain, "little bits of information gleaned from here and there in the occult literature, spiced with occasional novelties from Cayce's unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;[[K. Paul Johnson|Johnson, K. Paul]]. (1998). ''Edgar Cayce in Context: The Readings, Truth and Fiction''. State University of New York Press. p. 23. {{ISBN|978-0791439067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]] writes in ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]'', "Uneducated beyond the ninth grade, Cayce acquired his broad knowledge through voracious reading and from this he wove elaborate tales."&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]]. ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time]]'', 2002, {{ISBN|0-8050-7089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shermer wrote that, "Cayce was fantasy-prone from his youth, often talking with angels and receiving visions of his dead grandfather." Magician [[James Randi]] has said that "Cayce was fond of expressions like 'I feel that' and 'perhaps'—qualifying words used to avoid positive declarations." Examination of the readings do not show qualifying terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1992). ''Missing Pieces: How to Investigate Ghosts, UFOs, Psychics, &amp; Other Mysteries''. Prometheus Books. p. 159. {{ISBN|0-87975-729-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although Cayce was never subjected to proper testing, ESP pioneer [[Joseph Banks Rhine|Joseph B. Rhine]] of Duke University — who should have been sympathetic to Cayce's claims — was unimpressed. A reading that Cayce gave for Rhine's daughter was notably inaccurate. Frequently, Cayce was even wider off the mark, as when he provided diagnoses of subjects ''who had died'' since the letters requesting the readings were sent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. Prometheus Books. p. 159. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Science writer [[Karen Stollznow]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The reality is that his cures were hearsay and his treatments were folk remedies that were useless at best and dangerous at worse&amp;nbsp;... Cayce wasn't able to cure his own cousin, or his own son who died as a baby. Many of Cayce's readings took place after the patient had already died.&lt;ref&gt;Stollznow, Karen. (2014).

[[File:Fotografi av Conte Mattei - Hallwylska museet - 103008.tif|thumb|Count Cesare Mattei]]
'''Electrohomoeopathy''' (or '''Mattei cancer cure''') is a derivative of [[homeopathy]] invented in the 19th century by Count Cesare Mattei. The name is derived from a combination of ''electro'' (referring to an electric [[energy (esotericism)|bio-energy]] content supposedly extracted from plants and of therapeutic value, rather than [[electricity]] in its conventional sense) and ''homeopathy'' (referring to an alternative medicinal philosophy developed by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] in the 18th century). Electrohomeopathy has been defined as the combination of electrical devices and homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturowatch.org/hx/fishbein.html|title=Naturopathy and Its Professors (1932)|work=naturowatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucrative for its inventor and popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomoeopathy has been described as "utter idiocy". Like all homeopathy, it is regarded by the [[modern medicine|medical]] and [[scientific community|scientific communities]] as [[pseudoscience]] and its practice as [[quackery]].

==History and criticism==
Electrohomeopathy was devised by Cesare Mattei (1809–1896) in the latter part of the 19th century. Mattei, a nobleman living in a castle in the vicinity of [[Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaplease.it/eng/megazine/giroditalia/rocchetta|title=Arabian Nights in the Apennines|work=italiaplease.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied natural science, anatomy, physiology, pathology, chemistry and botany. He ultimately focused on the supposed therapeutic power of "electricity" in botanical extracts. Mattei made bold, unsupported claims for the efficacy of his treatments, including the claim that his treatments offered a nonsurgical alternative to [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciper.org/print/RR1-3-1-3.html|title=Science in the 19th Century Periodical|work=sciper.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment regimens were met with scepticism by mainstream medicine:&lt;blockquote&gt;The electrohomeopathic system is an invention of Count Mattei who prates of "red", "yellow" and "blue", "green" and "white" electricity, a theory that, in spite of its utter idiocy, has attracted a considerable following and earned a large fortune for its chief promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1692368|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=3|issue=4|pages=231–48|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|pmid=18340885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notwithstanding criticisms, including a challenge by the British medical establishment to the claimed success of his cancer treatments,&lt;ref&gt;GW Potter, "Matteism: An Exposure", ''[[British Medical Journal|British Med J]]'', 13 August 1892&lt;/ref&gt; electrohomeopathy (or Matteism, as it was sometimes known at the time) had adherents in Germany, France, the USA and the UK by the beginning of the 20th century; electrohomeopathy had been the subject of approximately 100 publications and there were three journals dedicated to it.&lt;ref name=baylen&gt;{{cite journal
|first=J. O
|last=Baylen
|title=The Mattei cancer cure: a Victorian nostrum
|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society
|year=1969
|volume=7
|issue=169
|page=397
|jstor=1624730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Remedies are derived from what are said to be the active micro nutrients or mineral salts of certain plants. One contemporary account of the process of producing electrohomeopathic remedies was as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the nature of his remedies we learn ... that ... they are manufactured from certain herbs, and that the directions for the preparation of the necessary dilutions are given in the ordinary jargon of homeopathy. The globules and liquids, however, are "instinct with a potent, vital, electrical force, which enables them to work wonders". This process of "fixing the electrical principle" is carried on in the secret central chamber of a Neo-[[Moorish]] castle which Count Mattei has built for himself in the Bolognese [[Apennines]] ... The "red electricity" and "white electricity" supposed to be "fixed" in these "vegetable compounds" are in their very nomenclature and suggestion poor and miserable fictions.&lt;ref&gt;The Mattei Fable, ''British Med J'' Jan 17, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mattei's own ideas however, every disease originates in the change of [[blood]] or of the [[lymphatic system]] or both, and remedies can therefore be mainly divided into two broad categories to be used in response to the dominant affected system. Mattei wrote that having obtained plant extracts, he was "able to determine in the liquid vegetable electricity". Allied to his theories and therapies were elements of Chinese medicine, of medical [[humours]], of apparent Brownianism, as well as modified versions of [[Samuel Hahnemann]]'s homeopathic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Lodispoto, 'L'Electromiopathie du Comte Cesare Mattei', ''Zeitschrift für Klassische Homöopathie'' (English abstract) 1971; 15: 130-135&lt;/ref&gt; Electrohomeopathy has some associations with [[Spagyric medicine]], a [[holistic]] medical philosophy claimed to be the practical application of alchemy in medical treatment, so that the principle of modern electrohomeopathy is that disease is typically multi-organic in cause or effect and therefore requires holistic treatment that is at once both complex and natural.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Modern usage==
A symposium took place in Bologna in 2008 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Cesare Mattei,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesaremattei.com cesaremattei.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with attendees from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Germany]], UK, and the USA. Electrohomeopathy is practiced predominantly in India and Pakistan (RAJYA SABHA Parliamentary Bulletin- The Recognition of Electro Homeopathy System of Medicine Bill,
2015 by E. M. Sudarsana Natchiappan, M. P),&lt;ref&gt;The Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Research Desk) orders no. R14015/25/96-U&amp;H (R) (Pt.), 25 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but there are also a number of electrohomeopathy organizations and institutions worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

{{Paranormal}}
'''Extrasensory perception''' or '''ESP''', also called '''sixth sense''' or '''[[second sight]]''', includes claimed reception of information not gained through the recognized physical [[sense]]s, but sensed with the mind. The term was adopted by Duke University psychologist [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] to denote [[psychic]] abilities such as [[intuition]], [[telepathy]], [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], [[Clairvoyance#Clairaudience (hearing/listening)|clairaudience]], and [[clairvoyance]], and their trans-temporal operation as [[precognition]] or [[retrocognition]].&lt;ref name="SheehyChapman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Noel Sheehy|author2=Antony J.

[[Parapsychology]] is the study of paranormal psychic phenomena, including ESP. Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research.&lt;ref name="Cordón"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cordón, Luis A. |title=Popular psychology: an encyclopedia |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |location=Westport, Conn |year=2005 |page= 182|isbn=0-313-32457-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |quote=The essential problem is that a large portion of the scientific community, .including most research psychologists, regards parapsychology as a pseudoscience, due largely to its failure to move beyond null results in the way science usually does.

Within parapsychology, however, more than a century of experimentation has failed even to conclusively demonstrate the mere existence of paranormal phenomenon, yet parapsychologists continue to pursue that elusive goal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scientific community]] rejects ESP due to the absence of an evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain ESP and the lack of positive experimental results; it considers ESP to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Diaconis, Persi.

In the 1930s, at [[Duke University]] in North Carolina, [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] and his wife [[Louisa E. Rhine]] conducted investigation into extrasensory perception. While Louisa Rhine concentrated on collecting accounts of spontaneous cases, J. B. Rhine worked largely in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and ''psi'' and designing experiments to test them.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – now called ESP cards. They bear the symbols circle, square, wavy lines, cross, and star; there are five cards of each in a pack of 25.

In a telepathy experiment, the "sender" looks at a series of cards while the "receiver" guesses the symbols. To try to observe clairvoyance, the pack of cards is hidden from everyone while the receiver guesses. To try to observe precognition, the order of the cards is determined after the guesses are made. Later he used dice to test for [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sladek, John. (1974). ''The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs''.

The parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked criticism from academics and others who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine's experiments with failure. W. S. Cox (1936) from [[Princeton University]] with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded "There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Cox, W. S. (1936). ''An experiment in ESP''. Journal of Experimental Psychology 12: 437.&lt;/ref&gt; Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[C. E. M.

In 1938, the psychologist [[Joseph Jastrow]] wrote that much of the evidence for extrasensory perception collected by Rhine and other parapsychologists was anecdotal, biased, dubious and the result of "faulty observation and familiar human frailties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow]]. (1938). ''ESP, House of Cards''. The American Scholar 8: 13–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhine's experiments were discredited due to the discovery that [[sensory leakage]] or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Gulliksen]]. (1938). ''Extra-Sensory Perception: What Is It?''. American Journal of Sociology. Vol. 43, No. 4. pp. 623–634. "Investigating Rhine's methods, we find that his mathematical methods are wrong and that the effect of this error would in some cases be negligible and in others very marked. We find that many of his experiments were set up in a manner which would tend to increase, instead of to diminish, the possibility of systematic clerical errors; and lastly, that the ESP cards can be read from the back."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Charles M; Wiggins, Arthur W. (2001). ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins''. Joseph Henry Press. p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-309-07309-7}} "In 1940, Rhine coauthored a book, ''Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years'' in which he suggested that something more than mere guess work was involved in his experiments. He was right! It is now known that the experiments conducted in his laboratory contained serious methodological flaws. Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester’s eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester’s facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 122. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}} "The procedural errors in the Rhine experiments have been extremely damaging to his claims to have demonstrated the existence of ESP. Equally damaging has been the fact that the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jonathan C. (2009).

Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1405181228}}. "Today, researchers discount the first decade of Rhine's work with Zener cards. Stimulus leakage or cheating could account for all his findings. Slight indentations on the backs of cards revealed the symbols embossed on card faces. Subjects could see and hear the experimenter, and note subtle but revealing facial expressions or changes in breathing."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s parapsychologists became increasingly interested in the cognitive components of ESP, the subjective experience involved in making ESP responses, and the role of ESP in psychological life. This called for experimental procedures that were not limited to Rhine's favored forced-choice methodology. Such procedures have included [[dream telepathy]] experiments, and the [[ganzfeld experiment]]s (a mild sensory deprivation procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Marks, David; Kammann, Richard. (2000).

Joseph Henry Press. p. 165. {{ISBN|978-0309073097}} "Extrasensory perception and psychokinesis fail to fulfill the requirements of the scientific method.

(1992). ''Critical Thinking: A Functional Approach''. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co. p. 115. {{ISBN|0534165966}} "There exists no good scientific evidence for the existence of paranormal phenomena such as ESP.

There are many criticisms pertaining to experiments involving extrasensory perception, particularly surrounding methodological flaws. These flaws are not unique to a single experimental design, and are effective in discrediting much of the positive research surrounding ESP. Many of the flaws seen in the [[Zener cards]] experiment are present in the Ganzfeld experiment as well. First is the stacking effect, an error that occurs in ESP research. Trial-by-trial feedback given in studies using a “closed” ESP target sequence (e.g., a deck of cards) violates the condition of independence used for most standard statistical tests. Multiple responses for a single target cannot be evaluated using statistical tests that assume independence of responses. This increases likelihood of card counting and in turn, increases the chances for the subject to guess correctly without using ESP. Another methodological flaw involves cues through sensory leakage. For example, when the subject receives a visual cue. This could be the reflection of a Zener card in the holder’s glasses. In this case, the subject is able to guess the card correctly because they can see it in the reflection, not because of ESP. Finally, poor randomization of target stimuli could be happening. Poor shuffling methods can make the orders of the cards easier to predict, or the cards could’ve been marked and manipulated, again, making it easier to predict which cards come next.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, J. &amp; Wiseman, R. (1999). Does psi exist? Lack of replication of an anomalous process of information transfer. Psychological Bulletin, 125, 387–191. - meta-analysis of parapsychological research over 10 years following agreement on methodological criteria by proponents and skeptics.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The results of a meta-analysis found that when these errors were corrected and accounted for, there was still no significant effect of ESP. Many of the studies only appeared to have significant occurrence of ESP, when in fact, this result was due to the many methodological errors in the research.

A '''ganzfeld experiment''' (from the [[German language|German]] for “entire field”) is a technique used in [[parapsychology]] which is used to test individuals for [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP). The ganzfeld experiments are among the most recent in parapsychology for testing [[telepathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://parapsych.org/glossary_s_z.html#t | title=Parapsychological Association Glossary of Parapsychological terms | accessdate=2006-12-19|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927060915/http://parapsych.org/glossary_s_z.html#t |archivedate = September 27, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The ganzfeld was originally introduced into [[experimental psychology]] due to the experiments of the German psychologist [[Wolfgang Metzger]] (1899–1979) on the perception of a [[Ganzfeld effect|homogenous visual field]].&lt;ref name="Tyson2011"&gt;Philip John Tyson, Dai Jones, Jonathan Elcock. (2011). ''Psychology in Social Context: Issues and Debates''. Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 199–200. {{ISBN|978-1405168236}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, [[Charles Honorton]] had been investigating ESP and dreams at the [[Maimonides Medical Center]] and began using the ganzfeld technique to achieve a state of [[sensory deprivation]] in which he hypothesised that [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]] could work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Psi-mediated imagery and ideation in an experimental procedure for regulating perceptual input | author=Honorton &amp; Harper | journal=Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research | year=1974 | issue=68 | pages=156–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honorton believed that by reducing the ordinary [[Sensory processing|sensory input]], psi conductive states may be enhanced and psi-mediated information could be transmitted.&lt;ref name="Tyson2011"/&gt;

Since the first full experiment was published by Honorton and [[Sharon Harper]] in the ''Journal of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]]'' in 1974, the Ganzfeld has remained a mainstay of parapsychological research.

==Experimental procedure==
In a typical ganzfeld experiment, a "receiver" is placed in a room relaxing in a comfortable chair with halved ping-pong balls over the eyes, having a red light shone on them.  The receiver also wears a set of headphones through which [[white noise|white]] or [[pink noise]] (static) is played.  The receiver is in this state of mild sensory deprivation for half an hour. During this time, a "sender" observes a randomly chosen target and tries to mentally send this information to the receiver.  The receiver speaks out loud during the thirty minutes, describing what he or she can see.  This is recorded by the experimenter (who is blind to the target) either by recording onto tape or by taking notes, and is used to help the receiver during the judging procedure.

In the judging procedure, the receiver is taken out of the Ganzfeld state and given a set of possible targets, from which they select one which most resembled the images they witnessed. Most commonly there are three decoys along with the target, giving an expected rate of 25%, by chance, over several dozens of trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=ESP in the Ganzfeld | author=Palmer, John | journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume=10 | issue= 6–7 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of results==

===Early experiments===

Between 1974 and 1982, 42 ganzfeld experiments were performed.&lt;ref name=Honorton1985/&gt;&lt;ref name="EntangledMinds"&gt;{{cite book | title=Entangled Minds: Extrasensory Experiences in a Quantum Reality | author=Radin, Dean| publisher=Paraview Pocket Books | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-4165-1677-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Charles Honorton presented a paper at the annual convention of the Parapsychological Association that summarized the results of the ganzfeld experiments up to that date, and concluded that they represented sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of psi. [[Ray Hyman]], a psychologist, disagreed. The two men later independently analyzed the same studies, and both presented meta-analyses of them in 1985.&lt;ref name=Honorton1985&gt;{{cite journal | title=Meta-Analysis of Psi Ganzfeld Research: A Response to Hyman | author=Honorton, Charles | journal=Journal of Parapsychology | issue=49 | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Ganzfeld Psi Experiments: A Critical Appraisal |author=Hyman, Ray | authorlink=Ray Hyman | journal=Journal of Parapsychology | issue=49 | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyman criticized the ganzfeld papers for not describing optimal protocols, nor including the appropriate statistical analysis. He presented a factor analysis that he said demonstrated a link between success and three flaws, namely: flaws in randomization for choice of target; flaws in randomization in judging procedure; and insufficient documentation. Honorton asked a statistician, [[David Saunders (statistician)|David Saunders]], to look at Hyman's [[factor analysis]] and he concluded that the number of experiments was too small to complete a factor analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On Hyman's Factor Analysis | last=Saunders, David | journal=Journal of Parapsychology | issue=49 | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ganzfeld studies examined by Hyman and Honorton had methodological problems that were well documented. Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, J., &amp; Wiseman, R. (2002). ''A response to Storm and Ertel (2002)''. The Journal of Parapsychology, 66. pp. 183–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 ganzfeld experiments and to assess each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate [[documentation]], randomization and security as well as possibilities of [[sensory leakage]].."&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"&gt;[[Ray Hyman]]. ''Evaluating Parapsychological Claims'' in Robert J. Sternberg, Henry L. Roediger, Diane F. Halpern. (2007). ''Critical Thinking in Psychology''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 216–31. {{ISBN|978-0521608343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]].&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;

In 1986, Hyman and Honorton published ''A Joint Communiqué'' which agreed on the methodological problems and on ways to fix them. They suggested a computer-automated control, where randomization and the other methodological problems identified were eliminated. Hyman and Honorton agreed that replication of the studies was necessary before final conclusions could be drawn. They also agreed that more stringent standards were necessary for ganzfeld experiments, and they jointly specified what those standards should be.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Hyman|Hyman, R.]], and Honorton, C. (1986). ''A joint communiqué: the psi ganzfeld controversy''.

===Autoganzfeld===
[[Image:Hyman LeeRoss DarylBem VictorBenassi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ray Hyman in 1983 with [[Lee Ross]], Daryl Bem and Victor Benassi.]]

In 1982 Honorton had started a series of autoganzfeld experiments at his Psychophysical Research Laboratories (PRL). These studies were specifically designed to avoid the same potential problems as those identified in the 1986 joint communiqué issued by Hyman and Honorton. The PRL trials continued until September 1989. In 1990 Honorton ''et al''. published the results of 11 autoganzfeld experiments they claimed met the standards specified by Hyman and Honorton (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Honorton, C., Berger, R.E., Varvoglis, M.P., Quant, M., Derr, P., Schechter, E.I., &amp; Ferrari, D.C. (1990). ''Psi Communication in the Ganzfeld''. Journal of Parapsychology, 54. pp. 99–139.&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments, 240 participants contributed 329 sessions.&lt;ref name="BemHonorton1994"/&gt;

Hyman analyzed these experiments and wrote they met most, but not all of the "stringent standards" of the joint communiqué.&lt;ref name="Hyman1994"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyman Ray | authorlink=Ray Hyman | | year = 1994 | title =  Anomaly or artifact? Comments on Bem and Honorton.| url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 19–24 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed concerns with the randomization procedure, the reliability of which he was not able to confirm based on the data provided by Bem. Hyman further noted that although the overall hit rate of 32% was significant, the hit rate for static targets (pictures) was in fact insignificant (inconsistently with previous ganzfeld research). The overall significance of the experiments was solely due to dynamic targets (videos).&lt;ref name="Hyman1994"/&gt; In the hit rates regarding these dynamic targets, however, some interesting patterns were found that implied visual cues may have been leaked:

{{quote|The most suspicious pattern was the fact that the hit rate for a given target increased with the frequency of occurrence of that target in the experiment. The hit rate for the targets that occurred only once was right at the chance expectation of 25%. For targets that appeared twice the hit rate crept up to 28%. For those that occurred three times it was 38%, and for those targets that occurred six or more times, the hit rate was 52%. Each time a videotape is played its quality can degrade. It is plausible then, that when a frequently used clip is the target for a given session, it may be physically distinguishable from the other three decoy clips that are presented to the subject for judging.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;}}

Hyman wrote these studies were an improvement over their older counterparts, but were not a successful replication of the ganzfeld experiments, nor a confirmation of psi.&lt;ref name="Hyman1994"/&gt; He concluded the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of [[sensory leakage]].&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;

[[Richard Wiseman]] published a paper discussing a non-psi hypothesis based on possible sender to experimenter acoustic leakage in the autoganzfeld to account for the results.&lt;ref name="Wiseman1996"&gt;Wiseman, R., Smith, M. and Kornbrot, D. (1996). ''Exploring possible sender-to-experimenter acoustic leakage in the PRL autoganzfeld experiments''. Journal of Parapsychology, 60. pp. 97–128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Humphrey|Humphrey, Nicholas]]. (1996). ''Soul Searching: Human Nature and Supernatural Belief''. Vintage. p. 136. {{ISBN|978-0099273417}} "Richard Wiseman, a friend and former colleague of Honorton, has subsequently reanalysed the raw data trial by trial and shown that all the positive results can be attributed to those trials in which one or other of these sources of ‘sensory leakage’ was at least a possibility. In fact, in the relatively few trials (100 in all) where such leakage of information would not have been possible the receivers did no better than chance (26 per cent correct)."&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] has written "Wiseman and his colleagues identified various different ways in which knowledge of the target could have been leaked to the experimenter. These included cues from the videocassette recorder and sounds from the sender who, of course, knew the target's identity... their conclusions provide little reassurance that sensory cueing of the experimenter was in any way substantially blocked."&lt;ref name="Marks 2000"/&gt;

Milton and Wiseman (1999) carried out a meta-analysis of ganzfeld experiments in other laboratories. They found no psi effect; the results showed no effect greater than chance from a database of 30 experiments and a non-[[Statistical significance|significant]] [[Z-test|Stouffer Z]] of 0.70.&lt;ref name=MiltonWiseman1999&gt;{{cite journal | title=Does Psi Exist?

Lance Storm and Suitbert Ertel (2001) published a meta-analysis of 79 studies published between 1974 and 1996 and concluded the positive statistically significant overall outcome indicates a psi effect.&lt;ref&gt;Storm, L.. &amp; Ertel, S. (2001). ''Does psi exist? Comments on Milton and Wiseman's (1999) meta-analysis of ganzfeld research''. Psychological. Bulletin, 127. pp. 424–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Milton and Wiseman (2001) wrote the meta-analysis of Storm and Ertel was not an accurate quantitative summary of ganzfeld research as they had included early studies which had been widely recognized as having methodological problems which make it impossible to interpret the results as evidence of a psi effect.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, J. and Wiseman, R. (2001). [http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy391P/Does%20Psi%20Exist%20II%EF%80%A5.pdf ''Does psi exist? Reply to Storm and Ertel (2001)'']. Psychological Bulletin, 127. pp. 434–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meta-analysis was conducted by Daryl Bem, John Palmer, and Richard Broughton in which the experiments were sorted according to how closely they adhered to a pre-existing description of the ganzfeld procedure. Additionally, ten experiments that had been published in the time since Milton and Wiseman's deadline were introduced. Now the results were significant again with a Stouffer Z of 2.59.&lt;ref name=BemEtAl2001&gt;{{cite journal|title=Updating the ganzfeld database: A victim of its own success? |vauthors=Bem DJ, Palmer J, Broughton RS |journal=Journal of Parapsychology |volume=65 |issue=3 |date=September 2001 |pages=207–18 |url=http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/psych113/Bemetal.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914123724/http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/psych113/Bemetal.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock]], Jean Burns and Anthony Freeman.

===Contemporary research===
The ganzfeld procedure has continued to be refined over the years. In its current incarnation, an automated computer system is used to select and display the targets ("digital autoganzfeld"). This overcomes many of the shortcomings of earlier experimental setups, such as randomization and experimenter blindness with respect to the targets.&lt;ref name=GouldingEtAl2004&gt;{{cite journal | author=Goulding, A., Westerlund, J., Parker, A., &amp; Wackermann, J. | year=2004 | title=The first Digital Autoganzfeld study using a real-time judging procedure | journal=European Journal of Parapsychology | volume=19 | pages=66–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 produced hits, corresponding to a hit rate of 32.2%. This hit rate is [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] with p &lt; .001. Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics thought to be psi-conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the ganzfeld condition.&lt;ref name=StormEtAl2010&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.psy.unipd.it/~tressold/cmssimple/uploads/includes/MetaFreeResp010.pdf | journal=Psychological Bulletin | date=July 2010 | title=Meta-Analysis of Free-Response Studies, 1992–2008: Assessing the Noise Reduction Model in Parapsychology | author=Storm, Tressoldi, Di Risio | volume=136 | issue=4 | pages=471–85 | accessdate=2010-08-18 | pmid=20565164 | doi=10.1037/a0019457 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124055506/http://www.psy.unipd.it/~tressold/cmssimple/uploads/includes/MetaFreeResp010.pdf | archivedate=2011-01-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyman (2010) published a rebuttal to Storm ''et al''. According to Hyman "reliance on meta-analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious. It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence." Hyman wrote the ganzfeld studies have not been independently replicated and have failed to produce evidence for psi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyman R. | authorlink = Ray Hyman | year = 2010 | title =  Meta-analysis that conceals more than it reveals: Comment on Storm et al.

A 2016 paper examined questionable research practices in the ganzfeld experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Testing for Questionable Research Practices in a Meta-Analysis: An Example from Experimental Parapsychology|last1=Bierman|first1=DJ|last2=Spottiswoode|first2=JP|last3=Bijl|first3=A|year=2016|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=5|page=1|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0153049|quote=We consider [questionable research practices] in the context of a meta-analysis database of Ganzfeld–telepathy experiments from the field of experimental parapsychology.

==Psi-conducive variables==

Bem and Honorton (1994) investigated certain [[Trait theory|personality traits]] and characteristics as potential psi-conducive variables which they suggested play an important role in claimed ESP performance.&lt;ref name=BemHonorton1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bem |first=Daryl J. |authorlink= |author2=Honorton, Charles |title=Does psi exist? Replicable evidence for an anomalous process of information transfer |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=4–18 |year=1994 |url=http://www.dbem.ws/Does%20Psi%20Exist%3F.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-31 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to parapsychologists these factors are thought to be positively correlated with increased scores in ganzfeld experiments, as compared to unselected participants.&lt;ref name=StormEtAl2010/&gt; Traits and characteristics of subjects thought to increase the chance of obtaining a successful hit rate in a psi experiment include:
* Positive belief in psi; ESP &lt;ref name=Lawrence1993&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lawrence, T.R. | year=1993 | title=Gathering in the sheep and goats: A meta-analysis of forced-choice sheep-goat ESP studies,1947–1993 | journal=In Proceedings of the 36th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association | pages=75–86 | location=Durham, NC | publisher=Parapsychological Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prior psi experiences &lt;ref name=BemHonorton1994/&gt;
* Practicing a mental discipline such as meditation &lt;ref name=BemEtAl2001/&gt;
* Creativity &lt;ref name=BemHonorton1994/&gt;
* Artistic ability &lt;ref name=BemHonorton1994/&gt;
* Emotional closeness with the sender &lt;ref name=Broughton1997&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Broughton, R.S.  |author2=Alexander, C.H. | year=1997 | title=AutoganzfeldII: An attempted replication of the PRL ganzfeld research | journal=Journal of Parapsychology | volume =61 | pages=209–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are a number of reasons that researchers avoid special participants and sample only normal populations, these factors are important considerations in future replications of ganzfeld experiment, and may be useful in predicting the outcome of these studies.&lt;ref name=StormEtAl2010/&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Image:Richard Wiseman-Emcee-CSICON 2012-Nashville-Opening Remarks-OCT 26 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Richard Wiseman]] has suggested various [[sensory leakage]] problems with the autoganzfeld experiments.]]
There are several common criticisms of some or all of the ganzfeld experiments:
* ''Isolation'' — [[Richard Wiseman]] and others argue that not all of the studies used soundproof rooms, so it is possible that when videos were playing, the experimenter could have heard it, and later given involuntary cues to the receiver during the selection process. It could even have been possible that the receiver themselves could hear the video.&lt;ref name="Wiseman1996"/&gt;
* ''Randomization'' — When subjects are asked to choose from a variety of selections, there is an inherent bias to choose the first selection they are shown. If the order in which they are shown the selections is randomized each time, this bias will be averaged out. The randomization procedures used in the experiment have been criticized for not randomizing satisfactorily.&lt;ref&gt;

* ''The psi assumption'' — The assumption that any statistical deviation from chance is evidence for telepathy is highly controversial. Strictly speaking, a deviation from chance is only evidence that either this was a rare, statistically unlikely occurrence that happened by chance, or ''something'' was causing a deviation from chance. Flaws in the experimental design are a common cause of this, and so the assumption that it must be telepathy is [[fallacy|fallacious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Writing in 1985, [[C. E. M. Hansel]] discovered weaknesses in the design and possibilities of sensory leakage in the ganzfeld experiments reported by [[Carl Sargent]] and other parapsychologists. Hansel concluded the ganzfeld studies had not been independently replicated and that "ESP is no nearer to being established than it was a hundred years ago."&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel|Hansel, C. E. M]]. ''The Search for a Demonstration of ESP'' in [[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 97–127&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] in his book ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]'' (2000) has noted that during the autoganzfeld experiments the experimenter sat only fourteen feet from the sender's room. Soundproofing tiles were eventually added but they were designed to "absorb sound not to prevent transmission." According to Marks this was inadequate and no different than using any standard internal wall. The door and door frame were also a possible source of sensory leakage and none of these problems were ever eliminated.&lt;ref name="Marks 2000"/&gt;

[[Terence Hines]] wrote in 2003 that the ganzfeld studies could not be said to provide evidence for psi as the alleged evidence disappears as the tightness of [[Scientific control|experimental controls]] is increased. As research progresses [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables]] in science become clearer as more studies are published that describe under what specific condition the particular effect can be demonstrated. This is in opposition to the ganzfeld studies. According to Hines, there was "no clear way to obtain results showing any psychic phenomenon reliably" and that "the most reasonable conclusion" was that the effect did not exist and had never existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 137–38. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 review, [[Ray Hyman]] wrote that [[Parapsychology|parapsychologists]] agree they have no positive theory of psi as it is negatively defined as any effect that cannot be currently explained in terms of chance or normal causes. Hyman saw this as a fallacy, as it encouraged parapsychologists to use any peculiarity in the data as a characteristic of psi. Hyman also wrote that parapsychologists have admitted it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of non-paranormal causes in the ganzfeld experiment. There is no independent method to indicate the presence or absence of psi.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;

{{quote|Until parapsychologists can provide a positive way to indicate the presence of psi, the different effect sizes that occur in experiments are just as likely to result from many different things rather than one thing called psi. Indeed given the obvious instability and elusiveness of the findings, the best guess might very well be that we are dealing with a variety of [[Murphy's Law]] rather than a revolutionary anomaly called psi.|Ray Hyman, ''Evaluating Parapsychological Claims'', 2007&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;}}

In their book ''50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology'' (2011), [[Scott O. Lilienfeld]] and colleagues have written that the ganzfeld being a reliable technique is far from being resolved. They concluded that ESP has not been successfully demonstrated in experiments for over 150 years so this is hardly encouraging.&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, Scott O; Lynn, Steven Jay; Ruscio, John; Beyerstein, Barry L. (2009). ''Myth #3 Extrasensory Perception (ESP) Is a Well Established Scientific
Phenomenon''. In ''50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread Misconceptions About Human Behavior''. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1405131124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 podcast, [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] reviewed the flaws of the ganzfeld studies and came to the conclusion the technique had failed as evidence for [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]] and interest in ganzfeld has declined.&lt;ref name="Dunning2013"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4348|number=348|title=Ganzfeld Experiments|accessdate= November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

In 1979, [[Susan Blackmore]] visited the laboratories of [[Carl Sargent]] in [[Cambridge]]. She noticed a number of irregularities in the procedure and wrote about them for the ''Journal of the Society for Psychical Research''.

{{quote|It now appeared that in one session&amp;nbsp;– number 9&amp;nbsp;– the following events had taken place.
# Sargent did the randomization when he should not have.
# A 'B' went missing from the drawer during the session, instead of afterwards.
# Sargent came into the judging and "pushed" the subject towards 'B'.
# An error of addition was made in favour of 'B' and 'B' was chosen.
# 'B' was the target and the session a direct hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Report of a Visit to Carl Sargent's Laboratory |author= Blackmore, Susan |journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research |volume=54 |pages=186–98 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article, along with further criticisms of Sargent's work from [[Adrian Parker (parapsychologist)|Adrian Parker]] and [[Nils Wiklund]] remained unpublished until 1987 but all were well known in parapsychological circles.  Sargent wrote a rebuttal to these criticisms (also not published until 1987) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sceptical fairytales from Bristol |author=Sargent, Carl |journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research |volume=54 |pages=208–18 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he did not deny what Blackmore had observed, but argued that her conclusions based on those observations were wrong and prejudiced.  His co-workers also responded, saying that any deviation from protocol was the result of “random errors” rather than any concerted attempt at fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cheating, psi, and the appliance of science: a reply to Blackmore |author=Harley, Matthews |journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research |volume=54 |pages=199–207 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Sargent stopped working in parapsychology after this and did not respond "in a timely fashion" when the Council of the Parapsychological Association asked for his data, and so his membership of that organization was allowed to lapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beloff |first=John |title=Parapsychology: A Concise History |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |pages=283–84 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' in 2018, Blackmore states that Sargent "deliberately violated his own protocols and in one trial had almost certainly cheated." Psychologists reading [[Daryl Bem]]'s review in ''Psychological Bulletin'' would "not have a clue that serious doubt had been cast on more than a quarter of the studies involved" Sargent and Chuck Honortons. When Blackmore confronted Sargent, he told her "it wouldn't matter if some experiments were unreliable because, after all, we know that psi exists". Blackmore also recounts having a discussion with Bem at a consciousness conference where she challenged him on his support of Sargent and Honorton's research, he replied "it did not matter".  Blackmore writes, "But it does matter. ... It matters because Bem's continued claims mislead a willing public into believing that there is reputable scientific evidence for ESP in the Ganzfeld when there is not".&lt;ref name="Blackmore 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blackmore |first1=Susan |authorlink= Susan Blackmore|title=Daryl Bem and Psi in the Ganzfeld |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=44-45 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geopark''' is a unified area that advances the protection and use of geological heritage in a sustainable way, and promotes the economic well-being of the people who live there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas_Zouros/publication/258100065_Geoparks_Celebrating_earth_heritage_sustaining_local_communities/links/0deec5272cb8fee05e000000.pdf Patrick J. Mc Keever and Nickolas Zouros (2005). Geoparks: Celebrating earth heritage, sustaining local communities. EPISODES, December 2005, pp. 274–278.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are global geoparks and national geoparks.

==Concepts==
A UNESCO definition of ''global geopark'' is a unified area with a geological heritage of international significance.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/global-geoparks/some-questions-about-geoparks/what-is-a-global-geopark/ |title=What is a Global Geopark? &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological [[hazard]]s, including [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s and many help prepare [[disaster]] mitigation strategies with [[Local community|local communities]]. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current [[climate change]]s as well as demonstrating a "best practise" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of "[[green tourism]]". [[Tourism]] industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.

Geoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for [[natural resource]]s, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding [[Natural environment|environment]] while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the [[landscape]]. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark" /&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of the concept of geopark and tourism promotion in geoparks differentiates itself from other models of [[sustainable tourism]]. In fact, sustainable tourism promotion within geoparks encompasses many of the features of sustainable tourism including geo-tourism (geo-site tourism: as a basic factor), community-based tourism and integrated rural tourism (as a vital need), [[ecotourism]], and [[cultural heritage]] tourism.

==Global Network and UNESCO==
The [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) is supported by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). Many national geoparks and other local geoparks projects also exist which are not included in the Global Geoparks Network.

The geoparks initiative was launched by UNESCO in response to the perceived need for an international initiative that recognizes sites representing an [[earth science]] interest.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About—UNESCO's role in geopark initiative |url=http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |publisher=Geopark Iskar Panega |year=2007 |work=Geopark Iskar Panega website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025602/http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |archivedate=2014-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Geoparks Network  aims at enhancing the value of such sites while at the same time creating [[employment]] and promoting regional [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt; The Global Geoparks Network works in synergy with UNESCO's [[World Heritage]] Centre and [[Man and the Biosphere]] (MAB) World Network of Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt;

===Qualification===
The Global Geoparks Network (GGN) is a UNESCO activity established in 1998. According to UNESCO, for a geopark to apply to be included in the GGN, it needs to:

* have a management plan designed to foster socio-economic development that is [[sustainable]] based on [[geotourism]]
* demonstrate methods for conserving and enhancing geological heritage and provide means for teaching geoscientific disciplines and broader environmental issues
* have joint proposals submitted by public authorities, local communities and private interests acting together, which demonstrate the best practices with respect to Earth heritage conservation and its integration into [[sustainable development]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;'April 2010 GEO4B/PM Advanced Level Examination - Advanced Information Booklet'&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7086">The '''Global Challenge Award''' is an online science and engineering design program for pre-college school students (e.g. middle school through high school) from all over the world. It is an initiative that started with a partnership with the [[University of Vermont]] in collaboration with the [[National Science Foundation]], currently funded by the MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmlcompetition.net/|title=Digital Media and Learning Competition 6|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; program as well as other foundations and corporations, wherein students have the opportunity to form teams with international counterparts and work towards a solution to mitigate [[global warming]] and help envision the future of [[renewable energy]]. The program is an online educational environment that uses [[game based learning]], [[simulation]] and Web-based science resources in a global competition. It relies on the personal initiative and creativity of students working in diverse teams. The access to the project via the Web makes it possible for students, parents, [[homeschooling]] families, teachers and interested global community members to get involved to help young people with their creative ideas for innovation in new forms of energy, conservation and increased productivity.

==History==
Founded in 2005 by Craig Deluca and David Rocchio of the Arno Group and Biddle Duke, the publisher of the Stowe Reporter newspaper company in Stowe, Vt., working in close partnership with Domenico Grasso of [[The University of Vermont]] (see) College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/|title=CEMS Home : University of Vermont|first=University of|last=Vermont|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program gives international student teams the opportunity to experience the excitement of scientific understanding and engineering design while working on significant human and societal issues – bringing science to life in innovative new applications. The program mission is to "give students the tools and confidence to solve global problems together."

The overarching model for the learning experiences offered worldwide to any student was influenced by  The George Lucas Foundation's Big ideas For Better Schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/big-ideas|title=Big Ideas for Better Schools: Ten Ways to Improve Education|first=|last=Edutopia|date=11 August 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Partnership for 21st Century Schools&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/ Partnership for 21st Century Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306025420/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/ |date=2010-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[game based learning]].  The Global Challenge was funded in part by a [[National Science Foundation]] award from the [[Innovative Technology Experiences for Students]] (ITEST) program, validating the project's design for engaging youth in science, technology, engineering and mathematics learning.

Since its founding in 2005, The Global Challenge has reached over 100,000 people worldwide and engaged over 4,000 students from 60 countries in forming teams to solve the challenge. About $200,000 in scholarships, travel, summer study have been provided to over 200 students from 10 countries.

==International connections==
The Global Challenge Award is responsible for identification of high school students who represent the United States in the [[International Earth Science Olympiad]] or IESO. Students and teachers travel to South Korea in 2007 and the Philippines in 2008. Plans are now underway to form a US-IESO selection process with the support of the American Geological Institute.

In addition, the design of the program builds international student teams. Students from over 79 countries participate each year. Top countries by participation with over 100 students each year have been the United States, India, China, and South Korea.

==Program elements==

There are several project areas in the Challenge. Some are designed specifically for teams, others students can work on alone. Students can mix and match projects based on their interest level and time. They can form a team to compete in one competition and, at the same time, work on individual points.

* ''Global Business Plan'' Students build an international team, envision a global solution, create a detailed [[business plan]], and submit it for judging.
* ''Technical Innovation Plan'' Students build an international team, envision any kind of technical solution, explain it to a panel of judges.
* ''Explorations'' Students work on their own on science, technology, engineering and mathematics units of study called "challenges."
* ''Green Earth Corps'' Students work on their own or with any team, build a home and business auditing service, earn while they learn and serve.
* ''GCA-350'' Students create an awareness event about the need to reach "350 parts per million" of [[CO2 emissions|CO2 in the atmosphere]].

Each Challenge earns certain points, and in the end, teams with the highest scores win and earn scholarships, travel awards to the Governor's Institute on Engineering in Vermont, cash prizes, and tuition scholarships.

==News coverage==

The program was the lead story "Save the World" in Learning &amp; Leading with Technology November 2007. In the Burlington Free Press in July 2008, and has led to a number of youth-authored articles on Cogito.org, for example: Using Nanotechnology for Cost Effective Converters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogito.org/Articles/ArticleDetail.aspx?ContentID=17460|title=Using Nanotechnology for Cost-Effective Catalytic Converters

The '''Goodman fatigue equation''' is used by engineers for [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] analysis. The equation is used to make [[correlation]]s of experimental fatigue data of [[metals]] and other materials.

The equation is also used to determine the failure mechanisms of sucker rods in pumping [[oil well]]s worldwide, and to help design new sucker rod strings for rod-pumped oil wells.

== Sources ==
From similar triangles the Goodman fatigue equation is :

( 4a)         τm /Sus + τa /Ses   =   1/n       in which the stress components are given by 
                                      τm   =   Ks 8 FmC / πd2     where   Fm   =   ( Fhi + Flo ) /2     and 
                                      τa   =   Kh 8 Fa C / πd2    where   Fa   =   ( Fhi - Flo ) /2

A '''graviquake''' is an [[earthquake]] occurring in an extensional tectonic setting, where the [[gravitational energy]] stored during the interseismic period is delivered by the collapse of a brittle upper crustal volume, slipping along a normal fault and generating the double couple recorded in the moment tensor solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12110 |title=Normal fault earthquakes or graviquakes &amp;#124; Scientific Reports |website=Nature.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iatromathematicians''' (from Greek ἰατρική "medicine" and μαθηματικά "mathematics") were a school of physicians in 17th-century Italy who tried to apply the laws of [[mathematics]] and [[mechanics]] in order to understand the functioning of the human body. They were also keen students of [[anatomy]]. These iantromathematicians made an effort to prove that applying a purely mechanical conception to the study of the human body is futile. The mechanical conceptions that they had referred to was [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s studies of the human body, and the writings of  Aristotle about the motion of animals related to geometric analysis. Iantromathematicians considered the bodies functioning to be measured by quantifiable numbers, weights, and measures.

==Iatromathematics==
The field of iatromathematics is allied to science; however, it lacks the applicability of the proper scientific method and is therefore considered a form of [[pseudoscience]]. It applies the study of [[astrology]] to medicine.

Iatromathematicians viewed the human body through astrological reasoning as well as mechanics. They associate various stars, or zodiac signs with the functioning of the human body. The twelve astrological signs contribute to each part of the body from head to toe. Moreover, planets and existing cosmos in space are correlated with certain parts of the body. Through examining a [[natal chart]], iatromathematicians attempt to predict biological setbacks in an individual.

Iatromathematicians examine the active and energetic temperament of the human body. Moreover, they explore the causes of various health problems and attempt to find ways to treat certain detrimental diseases. In iatromathematics, there is a particular assumption that there is an impact of various energetic fields caused on the star bodies. The star body of an individual is often referred to by astrologists as an energetic matrix and is believed to be spawned by heavenly bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, and several other astrological signs.

Iatromathematicians study these conceptions and try to regulate the path of the star body of individuals so that it will give a positive, rather than a negative result. By doing so, they believe that it will contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Its doctrine is based on [[cosmobiology]] in which several emotional and physiological dilemmas in the body are associated with the positioning of celestial bodies in outer space.

Iatromathematics is closely correlated with [[biomechanics]] because the field of biomechanics investigates macrobiotic bodies to a macroscopic degree through the appliance of several engineering principles. The perspective of iatromathematicians differed from that of iatrophysicists and iatrochemists in terms of the way human bodies function. Iatrophysicists predicted the deviations from the biological norm of the body through the appliance of physics, while iatrochemists measured the detrimental problems of the body by chemical means.

==Ibn Ezra==

Several individuals contributed to this field study of iatromathematics. For example, [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] (Rabbi Avraham Ben Meir Ibn Ezra) wrote nine different astrological treatises. He covered all the subsections of astrology which include the branches of natal, medicinal, horary, electional, and mundane. Ibn Ezra’s best known work was known as ''The Beginning of Wisdom''. Over time, various individuals studied his works comprehensively. One such person was [[George Sarton]], who is the founder of the [[History of Science Society]].

Recently, [[Archibald Pitcairne]] was mentioned as the "forgotten father of mathematical medicine" and his contribution praised to creating the bases of iatromathematics.&lt;ref name=pitc-lancet&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashrafian|first=Hutan|title=Mathematics in medicine: the 300-year legacy of iatromathematics|journal=Lancet|date=November 30, 2013|volume=382|page=1780|url=http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS014067361362543X.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2014|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62542-8|pmid=24290588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pitcairne&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerrini|first=Anita|title=Archibald Pitcairne and Newtonian Medicine|journal=Medical History|year=1987|volume=31|pages=70–83|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139685/pdf/medhist00068-0074.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2014|pmc=1139685|pmid=3543564|issue=1|doi=10.1017/s0025727300046329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A first-generation collegian, he attended Greenfield Community College in Massachusetts before transferring to the University of Iowa in 1980. He earned a bachelor of science degree in secondary education from the University of Iowa in 1983. After serving Camp Fire youth camps in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], followed by ski lodge maintenance at Millers Inn, [[Winter Park, Colorado]], he returned to the University of Iowa for graduate study, completing an endorsement in science education (biology) in 1985. From 1990 to 1992 Weld enrolled in the master’s program in biology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. He completed a master's degree in Science Education at the University of Iowa in 1994. In 1998, Weld completed the doctoral program in Science Education at the University of Iowa under [[John Penick]] and Robert Yager, earning competencies in ecology for work in predator-prey aquatic population regulation, and endocrinology for work on molt hormone synthesis in ''Cancer antennarius''.&lt;ref name="Spaziani"/&gt;

[[File:Leiden Bio Science Park.JPG|thumb|Leiden Bio Science Park]]

The '''Leiden Bio Science park''' (LBSP) ranks in the top five of the most successful [[Business park|science parks]]  in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Euraxess |url = http://www.euraxess.nl/newsletter/archive/may-2013/science-hubs-leiden-bio-science-park |title = Science hubs Leiden Bio Science Park  |accessdate=March 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of  [[Leiden]] and [[Oegstgeest]] and focuses on companies and Universities in the [[Biotechnology]] sector.

The park comprises 110 hectares (272 acres) with over 60 companies and knowledge-based institutions. The park is located mostly in Leiden and lies between Wassenaarseweg on the north and the Plesmanlaan on the south.

The park focuses mostly on the use of biotechnology for medical and biopharmaceutical applications.

== History ==
[[File:Leiden398.JPG|thumb|Leiden University Medical Centre]]
The LBSP was founded in 1984 in the Leeuwenhoek area west of [[Leiden Centraal railway station|Leiden Central Station]], between the Faculty of Science of the [[Leiden University]] and the former Academic Medical Hospital, known as the [[Leiden University Medical Center|LUMC]]. The municipality decided that this area should primarily be focused on biotechnology.

In 2005 the foundation'' Leiden Life meets Science'' was founded by the Leiden University, the municipality, the LUMC, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center|Naturalis]], [[Kamer van Koophandel|Chamber of Commerce]], the province [[South Holland]], [[University of Applied Sciences Leiden|University of Applied Sciences,]] and the ROC Leiden, with the purpose of growth the park in size and quality.

Substances, mixtures and exposure circumstances in this list have been classified by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) as '''''Group 3''': The agent (mixture or exposure circumstance) is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.'' This category is used most commonly for agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances for which the evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans and inadequate or limited in experimental animals. Exceptionally, agents (mixtures) for which the evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans but sufficient in experimental animals may be placed in this category when there is strong evidence that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in experimental animals does not operate in humans. Agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances that do not fall into any other group are also placed in this category.

Further details can be found in the [http://monographs.iarc.fr/indexfr.php/ IARC Monographs]

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrodynamics}}
[[File:Warszawa_Centrum_Nowych_Technologii_UW-6.jpg|thumb|right|Maxwell's equations (mid-left) as featured on a monument in front of [[University of Warsaw|Warsaw University']]s Center of New Technologies]]
'''Maxwell's equations''' are a set of [[partial differential equation]]s that, together with the [[Lorentz force]] law, form the foundation of [[classical electromagnetism]], classical [[optics]], and [[electric circuit]]s. The equations provide a mathematical model for electric, optical and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric motors, [[wireless]] communication, lenses, radar etc. Maxwell's equations describe how [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s are generated by [[electric charge|charges]], [[electric current|currents]], and changes of the fields. One important consequence of the equations is that they demonstrate how fluctuating electric and magnetic fields propagate at the speed of light. Known as [[electromagnetic radiation]], these waves may occur at various wavelengths to produce a [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] from [[radio wave]]s to [[Gamma ray|&amp;gamma;-rays]]. The equations are named after the physicist and mathematician [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who between 1861 and 1862 published an early form of the equations that included the Lorentz force law. He also first used the equations to propose that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon.

The equations have two major variants. The microscopic Maxwell equations have universal applicability, but are unwieldy for common calculations. They relate the electric and magnetic fields to total charge and total current, including the complicated charges and currents in materials at the [[atomic scale]]. The "macroscopic" Maxwell equations define two new auxiliary fields that describe the large-scale behaviour of matter without having to consider atomic scale charges and quantum phenomena like spins. However, their use requires experimentally determined parameters for a phenomenological description of the electromagnetic response of materials.

The term "Maxwell's equations" is often also used for [[#Alternative formulations|equivalent alternative formulations]]. Versions of Maxwell's equations based on the [[electric potential|electric]] and [[magnetic potential]]s are preferred for explicitly solving the equations as a [[boundary value problem]], [[Lorenz force#Lorentz force and analytical mechanics|analytical mechanics]], or for use in [[quantum mechanics]]. The [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism|spacetime formulations]] (i.e., on [[spacetime]] rather than space and time separately), are commonly used in [[High energy physics|high energy]] and [[gravitational physics]] because they make the compatibility of the equations with [[special relativity|specia]]l and [[general relativity]] [[manifest covariance|manifest]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Maxwell's equations in any form are compatible with relativity. These spacetime formulations, though, make that compatibility more readily apparent by revealing that the electric and magnetic fields blend into a single tensor, and that their distinction depends on the movement of the observer and the corresponding observer dependent notion of time.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Einstein]] developed special and general relativity to accommodate the invariant speed of light that drops out of the Maxwell equations with the principle that only relative movement has physical consequences.

Since the mid-20th century, it has been understood that Maxwell's equations are not exact, but a [[classical field theory|classical]] limit of the fundamental theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]].

==Conceptual descriptions==

===Gauss's law===

'''[[Gauss's law]]''' describes the relationship between a static [[electric field]] and the [[electric charge]]s that cause it: The static electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges, and the net [[electric flux|outflow]] of the electric field through any closed [[Gaussian surface|surface]] is proportional to the charge enclosed by the surface. Picturing the electric field by its field lines, this means the field lines begin at positive electric charges and end at negative electric charges. 'Counting' the number of field lines passing through a [[closed surface]] yields the total charge (including bound charge due to polarization of material) enclosed by that surface, divided by dielectricity of free space (the [[vacuum permittivity]]).

[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic1.svg|right|thumb|[[Gauss's law for magnetism]]: magnetic field lines never begin nor end but form loops or extend to infinity as shown here with the magnetic field due to a ring of current.]]

===Gauss's law for magnetism===

'''[[Gauss's law for magnetism]]''' states that there are no "magnetic charges" (also called [[magnetic monopole]]s), analogous to electric charges.&lt;ref name=VideoGlossary&gt;{{cite web | url =http://videoglossary.lbl.gov/#n45 | title =Maxwell's equations | last =Jackson | first =John | website =Science Video Glossary | publisher =Berkeley Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the magnetic field due to materials is generated by a configuration called a [[dipole]], and the net outflow of the magnetic field through any closed surface is zero. Magnetic dipoles are best represented as loops of current but resemble positive and negative 'magnetic charges', inseparably bound together, having no net 'magnetic charge'. In terms of field lines, this equation states that magnetic field lines neither begin nor end but make loops or extend to infinity and back. In other words, any magnetic field line that enters a given volume must somewhere exit that volume. Equivalent technical statements are that the sum total [[magnetic flux]] through any Gaussian surface is zero, or that the magnetic field is a [[solenoidal vector field]].

===Faraday's law===
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|thumb|left|In a [[geomagnetic storm]], a surge in the flux of charged particles temporarily alters Earth's magnetic field, which induces electric fields in Earth's atmosphere, thus causing surges in electrical [[power grid]]s. (Not to scale.)]]
The '''[[Faraday's law of induction#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday]]''' version of [[Faraday's law of induction]] describes how a time varying [[magnetic field]] creates ("induces") an [[electric field]].&lt;ref name=VideoGlossary/&gt; In integral form, it states that the work per unit charge required to move a charge around a closed loop equals the rate of decrease of the magnetic flux through the enclosed surface.

The dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines similar to a magnetic field, unless superposed by a static (charge induced) electric field. This aspect of [[electromagnetic induction]] is the operating principle behind many [[electric generator]]s: for example, a rotating [[bar magnet]] creates a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates an electric field in a nearby wire.

===Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition===

[[Image:Magnetic core.jpg|right|thumb|[[Magnetic core memory]] (1954) is an application of [[Ampère's law]]. Each [[Magnetic core|core]] stores one [[bit]] of data.]]
'''[[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition]]''' states that magnetic fields can be generated in two ways: by [[electric current]] (this was the original "Ampère's law") and by changing electric fields (this was "Maxwell's addition", which he called [[displacement current]]). In integral form, the magnetic field induced around any closed loop is proportional to the electric current plus displacement current (proportional to the rate of change of electric flux) through the enclosed surface.

Maxwell's addition to Ampère's law is particularly important: it makes the set of equations mathematically consistent for non static fields, without changing the laws of Ampere and Gauss for static fields.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Jackson, ''Classical Electrodynamics'', section 6.3&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a consequence, it predicts that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field and vice versa.&lt;ref name=VideoGlossary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1DZz341Pp50C&amp;pg=PA809 ''Principles of physics: a calculus-based text''], by R. A. Serway, J. W. Jewett, page 809.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these equations allow self-sustaining "[[electromagnetic waves]]" to travel through empty space (see [[electromagnetic wave equation]]).

The speed calculated for electromagnetic waves, which could be predicted from experiments on charges and currents,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The quantity we would now call {{math|{{frac|{{sqrt|''ε''{{sub|0}}''μ''{{sub|0}}}}}}}}, with units of velocity, was directly measured before Maxwell's equations, in an 1855 experiment by [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]]. They charged a [[leyden jar]] (a kind of [[capacitor]]), and measured the [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic force]] associated with the potential; then, they discharged it while measuring the [[Ampère's force law|magnetic force]] from the current in the discharge wire. Their result was {{val|3.107|e=8|ul=m/s}}, remarkably close to the speed of light. See Joseph F. Keithley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uwgNAtqSHuQC&amp;pg=PA115 ''The story of electrical and magnetic measurements: from 500 B.C. to the 1940s'', p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt; exactly matches the [[speed of light]]; indeed, [[light]] ''is'' one form of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (as are [[X-ray]]s, [[radio wave]]s, and others). Maxwell understood the connection between electromagnetic waves and light in 1861, thereby unifying the theories of [[electromagnetism]] and [[optics]].

==Formulation in terms of electric and magnetic fields (microscopic or in vacuum version)==

&lt;!-- please do not change to Electromagnetic field: we want to (modestly) stress that in this formulation Electric and Magnetic fields play an intertwined but separate role --&gt;

In the electric and magnetic field formulation there are four equations that determine the fields for given charge and current distribution. A separate [[Physical law|law of nature]], the [[Lorentz force]] law, describes how, conversely, the electric and magnetic field act on charged particles and currents. A version of this law was included in the original equations by Maxwell but, by convention, is included no longer. The [[vector calculus]] formalism below, due to [[Oliver Heaviside]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Hunt (1991) ''[[The Maxwellians]]'', chapter 5 and appendix, [[Cornell University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Maxwell%27s_Equations |title=IEEEGHN: Maxwell's Equations |publisher=Ieeeghn.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become standard. It is manifestly rotation invariant, and therefore mathematically much more transparent than Maxwell's original 20 equations in x,y,z components. The [[#Relativistic formulations|relativistic formulations]] are even more symmetric and manifestly Lorentz invariant. For the same equations expressed using tensor calculus or differential forms, see [[#Alternative formulations|alternative formulations]].

The differential and integral equations formulations are mathematically equivalent and are both useful. The integral formulation relates fields within a region of space to fields on the boundary and can often be used to simplify and directly calculate fields from symmetric distributions of charges and currents. On the other hand, the differential equations are purely ''local'' and are a more natural starting point for calculating the fields in more complicated (less symmetric) situations, for example using [[finite element analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Partial differential equations and the finite element method |last=Šolín |first=Pavel |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=0-471-72070-4 |page=273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hIG3NZrnd8C&amp;pg=PA273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation in Gaussian units convention===
{{main|Gaussian units}}

The definitions of charge, electric field, and magnetic field can be altered to simplify theoretical calculation, by absorbing [[dimensional analysis|dimensioned]] factors of {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''c''}} into the units of calculation, by convention. With a corresponding change in convention for the [[Lorentz force]] law this yields the same physics, i.e. trajectories of charged particles, or [[work (physics)|work]] done by an electric motor. These definitions are often preferred in theoretical and high energy physics where it is natural to take the electric and magnetic field with the same units, to simplify the appearance of the [[electromagnetic tensor]]: the Lorentz covariant object unifying electric and magnetic field would then contain components with uniform unit and dimension.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|author=J. D. Jackson|title=Classical Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|isbn=0-471-43132-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vii}}  Such modified definitions are conventionally used with the Gaussian ([[Centimetre gram second system of units#Alternate derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism|CGS]]) units. Using these definitions and conventions, colloquially "in Gaussian units",&lt;ref name=Littlejohn&gt;

Note that the equations are particularly readable when length and time are measured in compatible units like seconds and lightseconds i.e. in units such that c = 1 unit of length/unit of time. Ever since 1983, metres and seconds are compatible except for historical legacy since ''by definition'' c = 299 792 458 m/s (≈ 1.0 feet/nanosecond).

Further cosmetic changes, called rationalisations, are possible by absorbing factors of {{math|4''π''}} depending on whether we want [[Coulomb's law]] or [[Gauss's law]] to come out nicely, see [[Lorentz-Heaviside units]] (used mainly in [[particle physics]]). In [[theoretical physics]] it is often useful to choose units such that [[Planck's constant]], the [[elementary charge]], and even [[Newton's constant]] are 1. See [[Planck units]].

&lt;!---please do not make this list much longer – we used to have a gigantic table of all the constants, variables, terminology, and units, which was converted into prose as it probably should for an encyclopedia (see the history in pre-2013). Editors (by all means in good faith) may add the units, alternative names and symbols, etc. to the list and make it longer and denser, then eventually there would be a good reason to resurrect the big table format again...---&gt;

Symbols in '''bold''' represent [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] quantities, and symbols in ''italics'' represent [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantities, unless otherwise indicated.

The equations introduce the [[electric field]], {{math|'''E'''}}, a [[vector field]], and the [[magnetic field]], {{math|'''B'''}}, a [[pseudovector]] field, each generally having a time and location dependence.
The sources are
*the total electric [[charge density]] (total charge per unit volume), {{math|''ρ''}}, and
*the total electric [[current density]] (total current per unit area), {{math|'''J'''}}.

The [[universal constant]]s appearing in the equations are
*the [[permittivity of free space]], {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and
*the [[permeability of free space]], {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and
*the [[speed of light]], &lt;math&gt;c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0\mu_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Differential equations====
In the differential equations, 
*the [[nabla symbol]], {{math|∇}}, denotes the three-dimensional gradient operator, [[del]],
*the {{math|∇⋅}} symbol (pronounced "del dot") denotes the [[divergence]] operator,
*the {{math|∇×}} symbol (pronounced "del cross") denotes the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] operator.

====Integral equations====
In the integral equations, 
*{{math|Ω}} is any fixed volume with closed [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] surface {{math|∂Ω}}, and
*{{math|Σ}} is any fixed surface with closed boundary curve {{math|∂Σ}},
Here a ''fixed'' volume or surface means that it does not change over time.
The equations are correct, complete and a little easier to interpret with time-independent surfaces. For example, since the surface is time-independent, we can bring the [[differentiation under the integral sign]] in Faraday's law:
::&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \iint_{\Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = \iint_{\Sigma}  \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
Maxwell's equations can be formulated with possibly time-dependent surfaces and volumes by using the differential version and using Gauss and Stokes formula appropriately. 
*{{oiint
   | intsubscpt=&lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle\partial \Omega }&lt;/math&gt;
   | integrand=}} is a [[surface integral]] over the boundary surface {{math|∂Ω}}, with the loop indicating the surface is closed
*&lt;math&gt;\iiint_\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a [[volume integral]] over the volume {{math|Ω}},
*&lt;math&gt;\oint_{\partial \Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[line integral]] around the boundary curve {{math|∂Σ}}, with the loop indicating the curve is closed.
*&lt;math&gt;\iint_\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[surface integral]] over the surface {{math|Σ}},
* The ''total'' [[electric charge]] {{math|''Q''}} enclosed in {{math|Ω}} is the [[volume integral]] over {{math|Ω}} of the [[charge density]] {{math|''ρ''}} (see the "macroscopic formulation" section below):
::&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q = \iiint_\Omega \rho \ \mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;
:where {{math|dV}} is the [[volume element]].
* The ''net'' [[electric current]] {{math|''I''}} is the [[surface integral]] of the [[electric current density]] {{math|'''J'''}} passing through a fixed surface, {{math|Σ}}:
::&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;math&gt;I = \iint_{\Sigma} \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;
:where {{math|d'''S'''}} denotes the [[vector area|vector element]] of surface area {{math|''S''}}, [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to surface {{math|Σ}}. (Vector area is sometimes denoted by {{math|'''A'''}} rather than {{math|'''S'''}}, but this conflicts with the notation for [[magnetic potential]]).

==Relationship between differential and integral formulations==
&lt;!---PLEASE NOTE: This section on the "relation between int/diff forms" is independent of units and should not be made a subsection or merged with the above section on SI units&amp;nbsp;— it should stay in its own section, yet as close as possible to the first mention of the equations. Thanks. ---&gt;
The equivalence of the differential and integral formulations are a consequence of the [[divergence theorem|Gauss divergence theorem]] and the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]].

===Flux and divergence===

[[File:Divergence theorem in EM.svg|thumb|Volume {{math|Ω}} and its closed boundary {{math|∂Ω}}, containing (respectively enclosing) a source {{math|(+)}} and sink {{math|(−)}} of a vector field {{math|'''F'''}}. Here, {{math|'''F'''}} could be the {{math|'''E'''}} field with source electric charges, but ''not'' the {{math|'''B'''}} field, which has no magnetic charges as shown. The outward [[unit normal]] is '''n'''.]]

According to the (purely mathematical) [[divergence theorem|Gauss divergence theorem]] the [[electric flux]] through the 
[[homology (mathematics)|boundary surface]] {{math|∂Ω}} can be rewritten as
::{{oiint
   | intsubscpt=&lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle\partial \Omega }&lt;/math&gt;
   | integrand=&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = \iiint_{\Omega} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}\, \mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;
   }}
The integral version of Gauss's equation can thus be rewritten as 
::&lt;math&gt; \iiint_{\Omega} \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} - \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\right) \, \mathrm{d}V = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Since {{math|Ω}} is arbitrary (e.g. an arbitrary small ball with arbitrary center), this is satisfied [[iff]] the integrand is zero. This is 
the differential equations formulation of Gauss equation up to a trivial rearrangement.

Similarly rewriting the [[magnetic flux]] in Gauss's law for magnetism in integral form gives  
::{{oiint
   | intsubscpt=&lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle\partial \Omega }&lt;/math&gt;
   | integrand=&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = \iiint_{\Omega} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}\, \mathrm{d}V = 0&lt;/math&gt;
   }}.
which is satisfied for all {{math|Ω}} iff &lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Circulation and curl===

[[File:Curl theorem in EM.svg|thumb|Surface {{math|Σ}} with closed boundary {{math|∂Σ}}. {{math|'''F'''}} could be the {{math|'''E'''}} or {{math|'''B'''}} fields. Again, {{math|'''n'''}} is the [[unit normal]]. (The curl of a vector field doesn't literally look like the "circulations", this is a heuristic depiction.)]]

By the [[Stokes' theorem|Kelvin–Stokes theorem]] we can rewrite the [[line integral]]s of the fields around the closed boundary curve {{math|∂Σ}} to an integral of the "circulation of the fields" (i.e. their [[curl (mathematics)|curl]]s) over a surface it bounds, i.e.

::&lt;math&gt;\oint_{\partial \Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} = \iint_\Sigma (\nabla \times \mathbf{B})\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;,
Hence the modified Ampere law in integral form can be rewritten as 
::&lt;math&gt; \iint_\Sigma  \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \mu_0 \left(\mathbf{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\right)\right)\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Since {{math|Σ}} can be chosen arbitrarily, e.g. as an arbitrary small, arbitrary oriented, and arbitrary centered disk, we conclude that the integrand is zero [[iff]] Ampere's modified law in differential equations form is satisfied.
The equivalence of Faraday's law in differential and integral form follows likewise.

The line integrals and curls are analogous to quantities in classical [[fluid dynamics]]: the [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid is the line integral of the fluid's [[flow velocity]] field around a closed loop, and the [[vorticity]] of the fluid is the curl of the velocity field.

==Charge conservation==

The invariance of charge can be derived as a corollary of Maxwell's equations. The left hand side of the modified Ampere's Law has zero divergence by the [[vector calculus identities#divergence of the curl|div–curl identity]]. Combining the right hand side, Gauss's law, and interchange of derivatives gives:

::&lt;math&gt;0 = \nabla\cdot \nabla\times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\left(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{J} + \varepsilon_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\nabla\cdot \mathbf{E}\right) = \mu_0\left(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{J} +\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
i.e.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
By the Gauss Divergence Theorem, this means the rate of change of charge in a fixed volume equals the net current flowing through the boundary:
::{{oiint
| preintegral =&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}Q_\Omega = \frac{d}{dt} \iiint_{\Omega} \rho \mathrm{d}V = -&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle \partial \Omega }&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{S} =  - I_{\partial \Omega}.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
In particular, in an isolated system the total charge is conserved.

==Vacuum equations, electromagnetic waves and speed of light==
{{Further|Electromagnetic wave equation|Inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation|Sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation}}

[[File:Electromagneticwave3D.gif|thumb|This 3D diagram shows a plane linearly polarized wave propagating from left to right, defined by {{math|1='''E''' = '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; sin(−ω''t'' + '''k''' ⋅ '''r''')}} and {{math|1='''B''' = '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; sin(−ω''t'' + '''k''' ⋅ '''r''')}} The oscillating fields are detected at the flashing point. The horizontal wavelength is ''&amp;lambda;''. {{math|1='''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 = '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ '''k''' = '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ '''k'''}} ]]

In a region with no charges ({{math|1=''ρ'' = 0}}) and no currents ({{math|1='''J''' = '''0'''}}), such as in a vacuum, Maxwell's equations reduce to:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &amp;= 0 \quad &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &amp;=              -\frac{\partial\mathbf B}{\partial t}, \\
  \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &amp;= 0 \quad &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf{B} &amp;= \mu_0\varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial\mathbf E}{\partial t}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the curl {{math|(∇×)}} of the curl equations, and using the [[Vector calculus identities#Curl of the curl|curl of the curl identity]] we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mu_0\varepsilon_0  \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = 0 \\
  \mu_0\varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\mu_0\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; has the dimension of (time/length)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Defining
&lt;math&gt;c = (\mu_0 \varepsilon_0)^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, the equations above have the form of the standard [[wave equation]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = 0 \\
  \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Already during Maxwell's lifetime, it was found that the known values for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; give &lt;math&gt;c \approx 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}&lt;/math&gt;, then already known to be the [[speed of light]] in free space. This let him to propose that light and radio waves were propagating electromagnetic waves, since amply confirmed. In the [[SI system |old SI system]] of units, the  values of &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 = 4\pi\cdot 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c =299 792 458 \, \text{m/s}&lt;/math&gt; are defined constants, (which means that by definition &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0 = 8.854... 10^{-12} \text{F/m}&lt;/math&gt;) that define the ampere and the metre. In the [[new SI]] system, only ''c'' keeps its defined value, and the electron charge gets a defined value.  
   
In materials with [[relative permittivity]], {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility|relative permeability]], {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[phase velocity]] of light becomes

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{p} = \frac{1}\sqrt{\mu_0\mu_\text{r} \varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\text{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

which is usually&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are cases ([[anomalous dispersion]]) where the phase velocity can exceed {{math|''c''}}, but the "signal velocity" will still be {{math|&lt; ''c''}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than {{math|''c''}}.

In addition, {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation, and are in [[phase (waves)|phase]] with each other. A [[sinusoidal]] plane wave is one special solution of these equations. Maxwell's equations explain how these waves can physically propagate through space. The changing magnetic field creates a changing electric field through [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]. In turn, that electric field creates a changing magnetic field through [[Ampère's circuital law|Maxwell's addition to Ampère's law]]. This perpetual cycle allows these waves, now known as [[electromagnetic radiation]], to move through space at velocity {{math|''c''}}.

==Macroscopic formulation==

The above equations are the "microscopic" version of Maxwell's equations, expressing the electric and the magnetic fields in terms of the (possibly atomic-level) charges and currents present. This is sometimes called the "general" form, but the macroscopic version below is equally general, the difference being one of bookkeeping.

The microscopic version is sometimes called "Maxwell's equations in a vacuum": this refers to the fact that the material medium is not built into the structure of the equations, but appears only in the charge and current terms. The microscopic version was introduced by Lorentz, who tried to use it to derive the macroscopic properties of bulk matter from its microscopic constituents.&lt;ref name="MiltonSchwinger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kimball Milton|author2=J. Schwinger|title=Electromagnetic Radiation: Variational Methods, Waveguides and Accelerators|date=18 June 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-29306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

"Maxwell's macroscopic equations", also known as '''Maxwell's equations in matter''', are more similar to those that Maxwell introduced himself.

In the "macroscopic" equations, the influence of bound charge {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} and bound current {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} is incorporated into the [[electric displacement field|displacement field]] {{math|'''D'''}} and the [[magnetizing field]] {{math|'''H'''}}, while the equations depend only on the free charges {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} and free currents {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This reflects a splitting of the total electric charge ''Q'' and current ''I'' (and their densities ''&amp;rho;'' and '''J''') into free and bound parts:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Q &amp;= Q_\text{f} + Q_\text{b} = \iiint_\Omega \left(\rho_\text{f} + \rho_\text{b} \right) \, \mathrm{d}V = \iiint_\Omega \rho \,\mathrm{d}V \\
  I &amp;= I_\text{f} + I_\text{b} = \iint_\Sigma \left(\mathbf{J}_\text{f} + \mathbf{J}_\text{b} \right) \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = \iint_\Sigma \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The cost of this splitting is that the additional fields {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} need to be determined through phenomenological constituent equations relating these fields to the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} and the magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}}, together with the bound charge and current.

See below for a detailed description of the differences between the microscopic equations, dealing with ''total'' charge and current including material contributions, useful in air/vacuum;&lt;ref group="note" name="Effective_charge"&gt;In some books—e.g., in U. Krey and A. Owen's Basic Theoretical Physics (Springer 2007)—the term ''effective charge'' is used instead of ''total charge'', while ''free charge'' is simply called ''charge''.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the macroscopic equations, dealing with ''free'' charge and current, practical to use within materials.

===Bound charge and current===
{{Main|Current density|Polarization density#Bound charge|Magnetization#Magnetization current|l2=Bound charge|l3=Bound current}}
[[File:Polarization and magnetization.svg|thumb|300px|''Left:'' A schematic view of how an assembly of microscopic dipoles produces opposite surface charges as shown at top and bottom. ''Right:'' How an assembly of microscopic current loops add together to produce a macroscopically circulating current loop. Inside the boundaries, the individual contributions tend to cancel, but at the boundaries no cancelation occurs.]]
When an electric field is applied to a [[dielectric|dielectric material]] its molecules respond by forming microscopic [[electric dipole]]s – their [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] move a tiny distance in the direction of the field, while their [[electron]]s move a tiny distance in the opposite direction. This produces a ''macroscopic'' ''bound charge'' in the material even though all of the charges involved are bound to individual molecules. For example, if every molecule responds the same, similar to that shown in the figure, these tiny movements of charge combine to produce a layer of positive [[Bound charge#Bound charge|bound charge]] on one side of the material and a layer of negative charge on the other side. The bound charge is most conveniently described in terms of the [[polarization density|polarization]] {{math|'''P'''}} of the material, its dipole moment per unit volume. If {{math|'''P'''}} is uniform, a macroscopic separation of charge is produced only at the surfaces where {{math|'''P'''}} enters and leaves the material. For non-uniform {{math|'''P'''}}, a charge is also produced in the bulk.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book|author=[[David J. Griffiths]]|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=third|section=4.2.2|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|year=1999}} for a good description of how {{math|'''P'''}} relates to the [[Bound charge#Bound charge|bound charge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat similarly, in all materials the constituent atoms exhibit [[magnetic moment#Examples of magnetic moments|magnetic moments]] that are intrinsically linked to the [[gyromagnetic ratio|angular momentum]] of the components of the atoms, most notably their [[electron]]s. The [[magnetic field#Magnetic dipoles|connection to angular momentum]] suggests the picture of an assembly of microscopic current loops. Outside the material, an assembly of such microscopic current loops is not different from a macroscopic current circulating around the material's surface, despite the fact that no individual charge is traveling a large distance. These ''[[Bound current#Magnetization current|bound currents]]'' can be described using the [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book|author=David J. Griffiths|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=third|section=6.2.2|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|year=1999}} for a good description of how {{math|'''M'''}} relates to the [[bound current]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The very complicated and granular bound charges and bound currents, therefore, can be represented on the macroscopic scale in terms of {{math|'''P'''}} and {{math|'''M'''}}, which average these charges and currents on a sufficiently large scale so as not to see the granularity of individual atoms, but also sufficiently small that they vary with location in the material. As such, ''Maxwell's macroscopic equations'' ignore many details on a fine scale that can be unimportant to understanding matters on a gross scale by calculating fields that are averaged over some suitable volume.

===Auxiliary fields, polarization and magnetization===
The ''[[List of electromagnetism equations#Definitions|definitions]]'' (not constitutive relations) of the auxiliary fields are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{r}, t) &amp;= \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) + \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{r}, t) \\
  \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{r}, t) &amp;= \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) - \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{r}, t)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''P'''}} is the [[polarization density|polarization]] field and {{math|'''M'''}} is the [[magnetization]] field, which are defined in terms of microscopic bound charges and bound currents respectively. The macroscopic bound charge density {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} and bound current density {{math|'''J'''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} in terms of [[polarization density|polarization]] {{math|'''P'''}} and [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}} are then defined as

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        \rho_\text{b} &amp;= -\nabla\cdot\mathbf{P} \\
  \mathbf{J}_\text{b} &amp;= \nabla\times\mathbf{M} + \frac{\partial\mathbf{P}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If we define the total, bound, and free charge and current density by

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        \rho &amp;= \rho_\text{b} + \rho_\text{f}, \\
  \mathbf{J} &amp;= \mathbf{J}_\text{b} + \mathbf{J}_\text{f},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and use the defining relations above to eliminate {{math|'''D'''}}, and {{math|'''H'''}}, the "macroscopic" Maxwell's equations reproduce the "microscopic" equations.

===Constitutive relations===
{{main|Constitutive equation#Electromagnetism}}

In order to apply 'Maxwell's macroscopic equations', it is necessary to specify the relations between [[Electric displacement field|displacement field]] {{math|'''D'''}} and the electric field {{math|'''E'''}}, as well as the [[Magnetic field#H-field and magnetic materials|magnetizing]] field {{math|'''H'''}} and the magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}}. Equivalently, we have to specify the dependence of the polarisation {{math|'''P'''}} (hence the bound charge) and the magnetisation {{math|'''M'''}} (hence the bound current) on the applied electric and magnetic field. The equations specifying this response are called [[constitutive relation]]s. For real-world materials, the constitutive relations are rarely simple, except approximately, and usually determined by experiment. See the main article on constitutive relations for a fuller description.&lt;ref name="Zangwill2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Zangwill|title=Modern Electrodynamics|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89697-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44–45}}

For materials without polarization and magnetisation, the constitutive relations are (by definition)&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|2}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0\mathbf{E}, \quad \mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[permittivity]] of free space and {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of free space. Since there is no bound charge, the total and the free charge and current are equal.

An alternative viewpoint on the microscopic equations is that they are the macroscopic equations ''together'' with the statement that vacuum behaves like a perfect linear "material" without additional polarisation and magnetisation.
More generally, for linear materials the constitutive relations are&lt;ref name="Zangwill2013"/&gt;{{rp|44–45}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon\mathbf{E}\,,\quad \mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\mu}\mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ε''}} is the [[permittivity]] and {{math|''μ''}} the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the material. For the displacement field {{math|'''D'''}} the linear approximation is usually excellent because for all but the most extreme electric fields or temperatures obtainable in the laboratory (high power pulsed lasers) the interatomic electric fields of materials of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; V/m are much higher than the external field. For the magnetizing field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, however, the linear approximation can break down in common materials like iron leading to phenomena like [[hysteresis]]. Even the linear case can have various complications, however.

Even more generally, in the case of non-linear materials (see for example [[nonlinear optics]]), {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''P'''}} are not necessarily proportional to {{math|'''E'''}}, similarly {{math|'''H'''}} or {{math|'''M'''}} is not necessarily proportional to {{math|'''B'''}}. In general {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} depend on both {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}, on location and time, and possibly other physical quantities.

In applications one also has to describe how the free currents and charge density behave in terms of {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} possibly coupled to other physical quantities like pressure, and the mass, number density, and velocity of charge-carrying particles. E.g., the original equations given by Maxwell (see [[History of Maxwell's equations]]) included [[Ohms law]] in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\text{f} = \sigma \mathbf{E}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Following is a summary of some of the numerous other mathematical formalisms to write the microscopic Maxwell's equations, with the columns separating the two homogeneous Maxwell equations from the two inhomogeneous ones involving charge and current. Each formulation has versions directly in terms of the electric and magnetic fields, and indirectly in terms of the [[electrical potential]] {{math|''φ''}} and the [[vector potential]] {{math|'''A'''}}. Potentials were introduced as a convenient way to solve the homogeneous equations, but it was thought that all observable physics was contained in the electric and magnetic fields (or relativistically, the Faraday tensor). The potentials play a central role in quantum mechanics, however, and act quantum mechanically with observable consequences even when the electric and magnetic fields vanish ([[Aharonov–Bohm effect]]).

Each table describes one formalism. See the [[Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field|main article]] for details of each formulation.  SI units are used throughout.

==Relativistic formulations ==
{{For|the equations in [[special relativity]]|classical electromagnetism and special relativity|covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism}}
{{For|the equations in [[general relativity]]|Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime}}

The Maxwell equations can also be formulated on a spacetime-like [[Minkowski space]] where space and time are treated on equal footing. The direct spacetime formulations make manifest that the Maxwell equations are [[relativistically invariant]]. Because of this symmetry electric and magnetic field are treated on equal footing and are recognised as components of the [[Faraday tensor]]. This reduces the four Maxwell equations to two, which simplifies the equations, although we can no longer use the familiar vector formulation. In fact the Maxwell equations in the space + time formulation are not [[Galilean transformation|Galileo invariant]] and have Lorentz invariance as a hidden symmetry. This was a major source of inspiration for the development of relativity theory. To repeat: the space + time formulation is not a non-relativistic approximation and it describes the same physics by simply renaming variables. For this reason the relativistic invariant equations are usually called the Maxwell equations as well.

Each table describes one formalism.

*In the tensor calculus formulation, the [[electromagnetic tensor]] {{math|''F''{{sub|''αβ''}}}} is an antisymmetric covariant order 2 tensor; the [[four-potential]], {{math|''A''{{sub|''α''}}}}, is a covariant vector; the current, {{math|''J''{{sup|''α''}}}}, is a vector; the square brackets, {{math|[ ]}}, denote [[Ricci calculus#Symmetric and antisymmetric parts|antisymmetrization of indices]]; {{math|∂{{sub|''α''}}}} is the derivative with respect to the coordinate, {{math|''x''{{sup|''α''}}}}. In Minkowski space coordinates are chosen with respect to an [[inertial frame]]; {{math|1=(''x''{{sup|''α''}}) = (''ct'',''x'',''y'',''z'')}}, so that the [[metric tensor]] used to raise and lower indices is {{math|1=''η''{{sub|''αβ''}} = diag(1,−1,−1,−1)}}. The d'Alembert operator on Minkowski space is {{math|1=◻ = ∂{{sub|''α''}}∂{{sup|''α''}}}} as in the vector formulation. In general spacetimes, the coordinate system {{math|''x''{{sup|''α''}}}} is arbitrary, the [[covariant derivative]] {{math|∇{{sub|''α''}}}}, the Ricci tensor, {{math|''R''{{sub|''αβ''}}}} and raising and lowering of indices are defined by the Lorentzian metric, {{math|''g''{{sub|''αβ''}}}} and the d'Alembert operator is defined as {{math|1=◻ = ∇{{sub|''α''}}∇{{sup|''α''}}}}. The topological restriction is that the second real [[cohomology]] group of the space vanishes (see the differential form formulation for an explanation). Note that this is violated for Minkowski space with a line removed, which can model a (flat) spacetime with a point-like monopole on the complement of the line.
*In the [[differential form]] formulation on arbitrary space times, {{math|1=''F'' = ''F''{{sub|''αβ''}}d''x''{{sup|''α''}} ∧ d''x''{{sup|''β''}}}} is the electromagnetic tensor considered as a 2-form, {{math|1=''A'' = ''A''{{sub|''α''}}d''x''{{sup|''α''}}}} is the potential 1-form, {{math|''J''}} is the current 3-form, {{math|d}} is the [[exterior derivative]], and &lt;math&gt;{\star}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hodge star]] on forms defined (up to its an orientation, i.e. its sign) by the Lorentzian metric of spacetime. Note that in the special case of 2-forms such as ''F'', the Hodge star &lt;math&gt;{\star}&lt;/math&gt; depends on the metric tensor only for its local scale&lt;!--On signature (1,3) or (3,1) and two forms: δ = −*d* so (d*d − *d*d*) = *(−*d* d + d −*d*) = *Hodge Laplacian --&gt;. This means that, as formulated, the differential form field equations are [[conformal geometry|conformally invariant]], but the Lorenz gauge condition breaks conformal invariance. The operator &lt;math&gt;\Box = (-{\star} \mathrm{d} {\star} \mathrm{d} - \mathrm{d} {\star} \mathrm{d} {\star}) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator|d'Alembert–Laplace–Beltrami operator]] on 1-forms on an arbitrary [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold#Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian spacetime]]. The topological condition is again that the second real cohomology group is trivial. By the isomorphism with the second [[de Rham cohomology]] this condition means that every closed 2-form is exact.

Other formalisms include the [[Geometric algebra#Spacetime Model|geometric algebra formulation]] and a [[matrix representation of Maxwell's equations]]. Historically, a [[quaternion]]ic formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Physical Space as a Quaternion Structure I: Maxwell Equations. A Brief Note.|author=P.M.

==Solutions==
Maxwell's equations are [[partial differential equations]] that relate the electric and magnetic fields to each other and to the electric charges and currents. Often, the charges and currents are themselves dependent on the electric and magnetic fields via the [[Lorentz force|Lorentz force equation]] and the [[#Constitutive relations|constitutive relations]]. These all form a set of coupled partial differential equations which are often very difficult to solve: the solutions encompass all the diverse phenomena of [[classical electromagnetism]]. Some general remarks follow.

[[Jefimenko's equations]] (or the closely related [[Liénard–Wiechert potential]]s) are the explicit solution to Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields created by any given distribution of charges and currents. It assumes specific initial conditions to obtain the so-called "retarded solution", where the only fields present are the ones created by the charges. However, Jefimenko's equations are unhelpful in situations when the charges and currents are themselves affected by the fields they create.

[[Numerical partial differential equations|Numerical methods for differential equations]] can be used to compute approximate solutions of Maxwell's equations when exact solutions are impossible. These include the [[finite element method]] and [[finite-difference time-domain method]].&lt;ref name=Monk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagstrom/&gt;&lt;ref name= Kempel&gt;

==Overdetermination of Maxwell's equations==
Maxwell's equations ''seem'' [[Overdetermined system|overdetermined]], in that they involve six unknowns (the three components of {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}) but eight equations (one for each of the two Gauss's laws, three vector components each for Faraday's and Ampere's laws). (The currents and charges are not unknowns, being freely specifiable subject to [[charge conservation]].) This is related to a certain limited kind of redundancy in Maxwell's equations: It can be proven that any system satisfying Faraday's law and Ampere's law ''automatically'' also satisfies the two Gauss's laws, as long as the system's initial condition does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H Freistühler &amp; G Warnecke |title=Hyperbolic Problems: Theory, Numerics, Applications |year=2001 |page=605 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXX_mG0vneMC&amp;pg=PA605#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Redundancy and superfluity for electromagnetic fields and potentials |journal=American Journal of Physics |author=J Rosen |volume=48 |issue=12 |page=1071 |doi=10.1119/1.12289|bibcode = 1980AmJPh..48.1071R }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation was first introduced by [[Julius Adams Stratton]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

By introducing dummy variables characterizing these violations, the four equations become not overdetermined after all. The resulting formulation can lead to more accurate algorithms that take all four laws into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Origin of Spurious Solutions in Computational Electromagnetics |author=B Jiang &amp; J Wu &amp; L.

Both identities &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \nabla\times \mathbf{B} \equiv 0, \nabla\cdot \nabla\times \mathbf{E} \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;, which reduce eight equations to six independent ones, are the true reason of overdetermination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Steven | last = Weinberg | title = Gravitation and Cosmology | publisher = John Wiley | date = 1972 | isbn = 0-471-92567-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|161–162}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Liu|first=Changli|eprint=1002.0892|title=Explanation on Overdetermination of Maxwell's Equations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{

==Maxwell equations as the classical limit of QED==

Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law (along with the rest of classical electromagnetism) are extraordinarily successful at explaining and predicting a variety of phenomena; however they are not exact, but a [[classical field theory|classical]] limit of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).

Some observed electromagnetic phenomena are incompatible with Maxwell's equations. These include  [[photon–photon scattering]] and many other phenomena related to [[photon]]s or [[virtual particle|virtual photons]], "[[nonclassical light]]" and [[quantum entanglement]] of electromagnetic fields (see [[quantum optics]]). E.g. [[quantum cryptography]] cannot be described by Maxwell theory, not even approximately. The approximate nature of Maxwell's equations becomes more and more apparent when going into the extremely strong field regime (see [[Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian]]) or to extremely small distances.

Finally, Maxwell's equations cannot explain any phenomenon involving individual [[photon]]s interacting with quantum matter, such as the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Planck's law]], the [[Duane–Hunt law]], and [[Single-photon avalanche diode|single-photon light detectors]]. However, many such phenomena may be approximated using a halfway theory of quantum matter coupled to a classical electromagnetic field, either as external field or with the expected value of the charge current and density on the right hand side of Maxwell's equations.

==Variations==

Popular variations on the Maxwell equations as a classical theory of electromagnetic fields are relatively scarce because the standard equations have stood the test of time remarkably well.

===Magnetic monopoles===
{{main|Magnetic monopole}}

Maxwell's equations posit that there is [[electric charge]], but no [[magnetic charge]] (also called [[magnetic monopole]]s), in the universe. Indeed, magnetic charge has never been observed (despite extensive searches)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[magnetic monopole]] for a discussion of monopole searches. Recently, scientists have discovered that some types of condensed matter, including [[spin ice]] and [[topological insulator]]s, which display ''emergent'' behavior resembling magnetic monopoles. (See [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1178868 sciencemag.org] and [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7266/full/nature08500.html nature.com].) Although these were described in the popular press as the long-awaited discovery of magnetic monopoles, they are only superficially related. A "true" magnetic monopole is something where {{math|∇ ⋅ '''B''' ≠ 0}}, whereas in these condensed-matter systems, {{math|1=∇ ⋅ '''B''' = 0}} while only {{math|∇ ⋅ '''H''' ≠ 0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may not exist. If they did exist, both Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law would need to be modified, and the resulting four equations would be fully symmetric under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|273–275}}

'''Observation''' is the active acquisition of [[information]] from a [[primary source]]. In living beings, observation employs the [[sense]]s. In science, observation can also involve the recording of [[data (information)|data]] via the use of [[scientific instrument]]s. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be [[qualitative property|qualitative]], that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or [[quantitative data|quantitative]] if a numerical value is attached to the observed [[phenomenon]] by [[counting]] or [[measurement|measuring]].

Observations play a role in the second and fifth steps of the scientific method. However, the need for [[reproducibility]] requires that observations by different observers can be comparable. Human [[sense]] impressions are [[subjectivity|subjective]] and [[qualitative data|qualitative]], making them difficult to record or compare. The use of [[measurement]] developed to allow recording and comparison of observations made at different times and places, by different people. Measurement consists of using observation to compare the phenomenon being observed to a [[Standard (metrology)|standard unit]]. The standard unit can be an artifact, process, or definition which can be duplicated or shared by all observers.  In measurement the number of standard units which is equal to the observation is counted.  Measurement reduces an observation to a number which can be recorded, and two observations which result in the same number are equal within the [[measurement|resolution]] of the process.

Human senses are limited and subject to errors in perception, such as [[optical illusion]]s. [[Scientific instrument]]s were developed to aid human abilities of observation, such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[clock]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[camera]]s, and [[tape recorder]]s, and also translate into perceptible form events that are unobservable by the senses, such as [[pH indicator|indicator dyes]], [[voltmeter]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, [[infrared camera]]s, [[oscilloscope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[geiger counter]]s, and [[radio receiver]]s.

One problem encountered throughout scientific fields is that the observation may affect the process being observed, resulting in a different outcome than if the process was unobserved. This is called the ''[[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]''. For example, it is not normally possible to check the air pressure in an automobile tire without letting out some of the air, thereby changing the pressure. However, in most fields of science it is possible to reduce the effects of observation to insignificance by using better instruments.

Considered as a physical process itself, all forms of observation (human or instrumental) involve [[amplifier|amplification]] and are thus thermodynamically [[irreversibility|irreversible processes]], increasing [[entropy]].

==Observational paradoxes==
In some specific fields of science the results of observation differ depending on factors which are not important in everyday observation.  These are usually illustrated with "[[paradox]]es" in which an event appears different when observed from two different points of view, seeming to violate "common sense".
* '''Relativity:''' In [[relativistic physics]] which deals with velocities close to the [[speed of light]], it is found that different observers may observe different values for the length, time rates, mass, and many other properties of an object, depending on the observer's velocity relative to the object.   For example, in the [[twin paradox]] one twin goes on a trip near the speed of light and comes home younger than the twin who stayed at home.  This is not a paradox: time passes at a slower rate when measured from a frame moving with respect to the object.  In relativistic physics, an observation must always be qualified by specifying the state of motion of the observer, its [[Frame of reference|reference frame]].
* '''Quantum mechanics:''' In [[quantum mechanics]], which deals with the behavior of very small objects, it is not possible to [[observer (quantum physics)|observe a system]] without changing the system, and the "observer" must be considered part of the [[system]] being observed. In isolation, quantum objects are represented by a [[wave function]] which often exists in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] or mixture of different [[quantum state|states]]. However, when an observation is made to determine the actual location or state of the object, it always finds the object in a single state, not a "mixture". The interaction of the observation process appears to "[[wave function collapse|collapse]]" the wave function into a single state. So any interaction between an isolated wave function and the external world that results in this wave function collapse is called an ''observation'' or ''measurement'', whether or not it is part of a deliberate observation process.

==Biases==
The human senses do not function like a video [[camcorder]], impartially recording all observations.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human perception occurs by a complex, unconscious process of [[abstraction]], in which certain details of the incoming sense data are noticed and remembered, and the rest forgotten.    What is kept and what is thrown away depends on an internal model or representation of the world, called by psychologists a ''[[schema (psychology)|schema]]'', that is built up over our entire lives.  The data is fitted into this schema.  Later when events are remembered, memory gaps may even be filled by "plausible" data the mind makes up to fit the model; this is called ''[[reconstructive memory]]''. How much attention the various perceived data are given depends on an internal value system, which judges how important it is to the individual. Thus two people can view the same event and come away with entirely different perceptions of it, even disagreeing about simple facts.  This is why [[eyewitness testimony]] is notoriously unreliable.

Several of the more important ways observations can be affected by human psychology are given below.

===Confirmation bias===
{{main|confirmation bias}}
Human observations are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and view of the world; we "''see what we expect to see''".&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book

It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, on the other hand, as in the [[scientific racism]] that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as [[blind experiment|blind]] or [[double blind experiment]]s, to minimize observational bias.

==="Cargo cult" science===
{{main|Cargo cult science}}
Another bias, which has become more prevalent with the advent of "[[big science]]" and the large rewards of new discoveries, is bias in favor of the researcher's desired hypothesis or outcome; we "''see what we want to see''". Called [[pathological science]] and [[cargo cult science]], this is different from deliberate falsification of results, and can happen to good-faith researchers.  Researchers with a great incentive or desire for a given outcome can misinterpret or misjudge results, or even persuade themselves they have seen something they haven't.  Possible examples of mistaken discoveries caused by this bias are [[Mars#Martian 'canals'|Martian "canals"]], [[N rays]], [[polywater]], [[cold fusion]], and [[perpetual motion]] machines. Recent decades have seen scientific scandals caused by researchers playing "fast and loose" with observational methods in order to get their pet theories published. This type of bias is rampant in [[pseudoscience]], where correct scientific techniques are not followed. The main defense against this bias, besides correct research techniques, is [[peer review]] and repetition of the experiment, or the observation, by other researchers with no incentive to bias. For example, an emerging practice in the competitive field of [[biotechnology]] is to require the physical results of experiments, such as serums and [[tissue culture]]s, be made available to competing laboratories for independent testing.

===Processing bias===
Modern scientific instruments can extensively process "observations" before they are presented to the human senses, and particularly with computerized instruments, there is sometimes a question as to where in the data processing chain "observing" ends and "drawing conclusions" begins. This has recently become an issue with [[digital image processing|digitally enhanced]] images published as experimental data in [[scientific paper|papers]] in [[scientific journal]]s. The images are enhanced to bring out features that the researcher wants to emphasize, but this also has the effect of supporting the researcher's conclusions. This is a form of bias that is difficult to quantify. Some [[scientific journal]]s have begun to set detailed standards for what types of [[image processing]] are allowed in research results. Computerized instruments often keep a copy of the "raw data" from sensors before processing, which is the ultimate defense against processing bias, and similarly scientific standards require preservation of the original unenhanced "raw" versions of images used as research data.

===Observational bias===
An observational bias occurs when researchers only look where they think they will find positive results, or where it is easy to record observations. This is called the "[[streetlight effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David H. Freedman |title=The Streetlight Effect |url= |quote= |work=[[Discover magazine]] |date=August 1, 2010 &lt;!--|accessdate=2010-08-24 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations in philosophy==
{{quote|"Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing [[Nature]] loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them."|Meditations. iv. 36. – [[Marcus Aurelius]]}}

Observation in [[philosophical]] terms is the process of filtering [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] through the thought process. Input is received via [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[visual perception|sight]], [[olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], or [[Haptic perception|touch]] and then analyzed through either rational or irrational thought.


For example, let us suppose that an observer ''sees'' a parent beat their child; and consequently ''observes'' that such an action is either good or bad.{{Citation needed|reason=What is the source of the distinction "seeing" versus "observing"?|date=May 2009}} Deductions about what behaviors are good or bad may be based on preferences about building relationships, or study of the consequences resulting from the observed behavior. With the passage of time, impressions stored in the consciousness about many, together with the resulting relationships and consequences, permit the individual to build a construct about the moral implications of behavior.

'''''Pathological Altruism''''' is a book edited by [[Barbara Oakley]], Ariel Knafo, Guruprasad Madhavan, and [[David Sloan Wilson]]. It was published on 5 January 2012 by Oxford University Press, and contains 31 academic papers. Oakley defines pathological altruism as "altruism in which attempts to promote the welfare of others instead result in unanticipated harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taranto |first=James |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324688404578545523824389986 |title=Best of the Web Today: Pathological Altruism |work=Wall Street Journal |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The book comprises a collection of essays which discuss negative aspects of [[altruism]] and [[empathy]] towards others, such as when altruism hurts the altruist, is taken to an unhealthy extreme, or causes more harm than good. Examples given include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid. It is considered the first book to explore negative aspects of [[altruism]] and empathy.&lt;ref name=oup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199738571.do |title=Pathological Altruism: Hardback: Barbara Oakley |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Oakley, [[anorexia]], supporting addictions of other people ([[codependency]]), animal hoarding, depression, guilt and self-righteousness can be pathological altruism. Oakley has also stated that suicide bombings and genocides can be caused by pathological altruism, when perpetrators of these acts believe they are behaving altruistically towards those who share their ideology.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Habash |first=Gabe |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/tip-sheet/article/49893-when-kindness-attacks-a-q-a-with-barbara-oakley.html |title=When Kindness Attacks: A Q&amp;A with Barbara Oakley |work=Publishersweekly.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
    
Oakley further states that some people are naturally "hypersensitive" or they have an excessive desire to "help" others. According to Oakley, such people are convinced that they are helping others without considering the practical results of their "help".&lt;ref name="publishersweekly1"/&gt;

==Reviews==
The book was widely reviewed, including reviews in the ''New Scientist'',&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128290-300-the-dark-side-of-altruism/ |title=The dark side of altruism |work=New Scientist |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Independent''.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/are-we-killing-people-with-kindness-6256124.html |title=Are we killing people with kindness?|work=The Independent |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nursing Standard'' said "I recommend this book to health professionals looking for a deeper understanding of altruism and its motivation. The arguments are clear and scholarly, and supported by a wealth of references."&lt;ref name=oup/&gt;

Writing in ''The New York Times'', Natalie Angier called book a "scholarly yet surprisingly sprightly volume". She wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;pathological altruism is not limited to showcase acts of self-sacrifice... The book is the first comprehensive treatment of the idea that when ostensibly generous 'how can I help you?' behavior is taken to extremes, misapplied or stridently rhapsodized, it can become unhelpful, unproductive and even destructive. Selflessness gone awry may play a role in a broad variety of disorders, including anorexia and animal hoarding, women who put up with abusive partners and men who abide alcoholic ones. Because a certain degree of selfless behavior is essential to the smooth performance of any human group, selflessness run amok can crop up in political contexts. It fosters the exhilarating sensation of righteous indignation, the belief in the purity of your team and your cause and the perfidiousness of all competing teams and causes.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=The Pathological Altruist Gives Till Someone Hurts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/04angier.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Aristotle Physica page 1.png|thumb|265px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|First page of text, Volume 2, of a work less formally known as "the Oxford Aristotle", with the usual label ''Ex Recensione [[Immanuel Bekker|Immanuelis Bekkeri]]'' appended to the title. The translation of ''ex'' is equivocal in English; it could mean "of" or "from", not helpful in this case. The image is not the original publication of Bekker's recension from which the standard [[Bekker numbering|Bekker numbers]] are derived. Indeed, Bekker numbers do not appear at all, though the recension is Bekker's, and the book and chapter numbers derived from the age of manuscripts (not known when) are used. For Bekker's arrangement, see the 1831 edition published by the Academia Regia Borussica in Berlin.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;An explanation of Bekker numbering along with an image of Page 184, the start of ''Physics'', is to be found in {{cite web | title=How to Cite Aristotle | url=http://minerva.union.edu/wareht/aristotle/how_to_cite_aristotle.pdf | publisher=Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. | accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Physics''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Φυσικὴ ἀκρόασις ''Phusike akroasis''; [[Latin]]: ''Physica'', or ''Naturalis Auscultationes'', possibly meaning "[[Natural philosophy|lectures on nature]]") is a named text, written in ancient Greek, collated from a collection of surviving manuscripts known as the [[Corpus Aristotelicum]] because attributed to the 4th-century BC philosopher, teacher, and mentor of Macedonian rulers, [[Aristotle]]. Due to the unique educational methods of the Athenian school founded by Aristotle, the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], at the period of its greatest success, and the accidental circumstances surrounding the disposition and rediscovery of its library after his death, it is possible to say that without a doubt some of that library descends to the ''Corpus'' and that some must be attributed mainly or entirely to Aristotle, but it is not possible to say for sure which works. The two answers excluded by the circumstances are "all" and "none".

Standard epistemological method has been to accept the entire ''Corpus'' tentatively as genuine; that is, transmitted by manuscript copying from one or more original manuscripts in the library. As soon as evidence is perceived or discovered to make a case that a work is not Aristotle's, it is crossed out, but left in the list. Such a cross-out does not mean that its author was not influenced by Aristotle, or did not have Aristotle's work in front of him.

== The meaning of physics in Aristotle ==
It is a collection of treatises or lessons that deal with the most general (philosophical) principles of natural or moving things, both living and non-living, rather than physical theories (in the modern sense) or investigations of the particular contents of the universe. The chief purpose of the work is to discover the principles and causes of (and not merely to describe) change, or movement, or motion (κίνησις ''kinesis''), especially that of natural wholes (mostly living things, but also inanimate wholes like the cosmos).  In the conventional [[Andronicus of Rhodes|Andronicean]] ordering of Aristotle's works, it stands at the head of, as well as being foundational to, the long series of physical, cosmological and biological treatises, whose ancient Greek title, τὰ φυσικά, means "the [writings] on nature" or "[[natural philosophy]]".

== Description of the content ==

The ''Physics'' is composed of eight books, which are further divided into chapters. This system is of ancient origin, now obscure. In modern languages, books are referenced with Roman numerals, standing for ancient Greek capital letters (the Greeks represented numbers with letters; i.e., I for A). Chapters are identified by Arabic numerals, but the use of the English word "chapter" is strictly conventional. Ancient "chapters" (capita) are generally very short, often less than a page. Additionally, the [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] give the page and column (a or b) used in the Prussian Academy of Sciences' edition of Aristotle's works, instigated and managed by Bekker himself. These are evident in the 1831 2-volume edition. Bekker's line numbers may be given. These are often given, but unless the edition is the Academy's, they do match any line counts.

===Book I (Α; 184a–192b)===
Book I introduces the Aristotle's approach to nature, which is to be based on principles, causes, and elements. Before offering his particular views, he engages previous theories, such as those offered by Melissus and Parmenides.  Aristotle's own view comes out in Ch. 7 where he identifies three principles: substances, opposites, and privation.

Chapters 3 and 4 are among the most difficult in all of Aristotle's works and involve subtle refutations of the thought of Parmenides, Melissus and Anaxagoras.

In chapter 5, he continues his review of his predecessors, particularly how many first principles there are. Chapter 6 narrows down the number of principles to two or three.  He presents his own account of the subject in chapter 7, where he first introduces the word '''matter''' (Greek: ''[[hyle]]'' to designate fundamental essence (ousia). He defines matter in chapter 9: "For my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be without qualification, and which persists in the result."

Matter in Aristotle's thought is, however, defined in terms of sensible reality; for example, a horse eats grass: the horse changes the grass into itself; the grass as such does not persist in the horse, but some aspect of it{{spaced ndash}}its matter{{spaced ndash}}does. Matter is not specifically described, but consists of whatever is apart from quality or quantity and that of which something may be predicated. Matter in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e. as a [[Substance theory|substance]]), but exists interdependently (i.e. as a "principle") with form and only insofar as it underlies change. Matter and form are [[Analogy|analogical]] terms.

===Book II (Β; 192b–200b)===
Book II identifies "nature" (''physis'') as "a source or cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily" (1.192b21). Thus, those entities are natural which are capable of starting to move, e.g. growing, acquiring qualities, displacing themselves, and finally being born and dying. Aristotle contrasts natural things with the artificial: artificial things can move also, but they move according to what they are made of, not according to what they are. For example, if a wooden bed were buried and somehow sprouted as a tree, it would be according to what it is made of, not what it is. Aristotle contrasts two senses of nature: nature as matter and nature as form or definition.

By "nature", Aristotle means the natures of particular things and would perhaps be better translated "a nature." In Book II, however, his appeal to "nature" as a source of activities is more typically to the [[Genus–differentia definition|genera]] of natural kinds (the [[Substance theory|secondary substance]]). But, contra [[Plato]], Aristotle attempts to resolve a philosophical quandary that was well understood in the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Hankinson1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxian planetary model]] sufficed for the [[wandering stars]], but no deduction of terrestrial substance would be forthcoming based solely on the mechanical principles of necessity, (ascribed by Aristotle to material causation in chapter 9). In [[the Enlightenment]], centuries before modern science made good on [[atomism|atomist intuitions]], a nominal allegiance to [[mechanistic materialism]] gained popularity despite harboring Newton's [[action at a distance (physics)|action at distance]], and comprising the native habitat of [[teleological argument]]s: Machines or artifacts composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other with their order imposed from without. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts. While Aristotle asserts that the matter (and parts) are a necessary cause of things{{spaced ndash}}the material cause{{spaced ndash}}he says that nature is primarily the essence or formal cause (1.193b6), that is, the information, the whole species itself.

{{quote
 | The necessary in nature, then, is plainly what we call by the name of matter, and the changes in it. Both causes must be stated by the physicist, but especially the end; for that is the cause of the matter, not vice versa; and the end is 'that for the sake of which', and the beginning starts from the definition or essence…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#646 |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle |editor=trans. by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye |at=II 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 |Aristotle |''Physics'' II 9
}}

In chapter 3, Aristotle presents his theory of the [[four causes]] (material, efficient, formal, and final&lt;ref&gt;For an especially clear discussion, see chapter 6 of Mortimer Adler, ''Aristotle for Everybody: Difficult Thought Made Easy'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;). Material cause explains what something is made of (for example, the wood of a house), formal cause explains the form which a thing follows to become that thing (the plans of an architect to build a house), efficient cause is the actual source of the change (the physical building of the house), and final cause is the intended purpose of the change (the final product of the house and its purpose as a shelter and home).

Of particular importance is the ''final cause'' or purpose (''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'').  It is a common mistake to conceive of the four causes as additive or alternative forces pushing or pulling; in reality, all four are needed to explain (7.198a22-25). What we typically mean by cause in the modern scientific idiom is only a narrow part of what Aristotle means by efficient cause.
He contrasts purpose with the way in which "nature" does not work, chance (or luck), discussed in chapters 4, 5, and 6. (Chance working in the actions of humans is ''tuche'' and in unreasoning agents ''automaton''.) Something happens by chance when all the lines of causality converge without that convergence being purposefully chosen, and produce a result similar to the [[teleology|teleologically]] caused one.

In chapters 7 through 9, Aristotle returns to the discussion of nature. With the enrichment of the preceding four chapters, he concludes that nature acts for an end, and he discusses the way that necessity is present in natural things. For Aristotle, the motion of natural things is determined from within them, while in the modern empirical sciences, motion is determined from without (more properly speaking: there is nothing to have an inside).

===Book III (Γ; 200b–208a)===
In order to understand "nature" as defined in the previous book, one must understand the terms of the definition. To understand motion, book III begins with the definition of change based on Aristotle's notions of [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|potentiality and actuality]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the topic with some interpretations of Aristotle's vocabulary, see {{cite encyclopedia | last=Sachs | first=Joe | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aris-mot.htm | title=Motion and its Place in Nature | encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change, he says, is the actualization of a thing's ability insofar as it is able.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brague|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the book (chapters 4-8) discusses the infinite (''apeiron'', the unlimited). He distinguishes between the infinite by addition and the infinite by division, and between the [[Actual infinity|actually infinite]] and potentially infinite.  He argues against the actually infinite in any form, including infinite bodies, substances, and voids.  Aristotle here says the only type of infinity that exists is the potentially infinite.  Aristotle characterizes this as that which serves as "the matter for the completion of a magnitude and is potentially (but not actually) the completed whole" (207a22-23).  The infinite, lacking any form, is thereby unknowable.  Aristotle writes, "it is not what has nothing outside it that is infinite, but what always has something outside it" (6.206b33-207a1-2).

===Book IV (Δ; 208a–223b)===
Book IV discusses the preconditions of motion: place (''topos'', chapters 1-5), [[The Void (philosophy)|void]] (''kenon'', chapters 6-9), and time (''khronos'', chapters 10-14).  The book starts by distinguishing the various ways a thing can "be in" another. He likens place to an immobile container or vessel: "the innermost motionless boundary of what contains" is the primary place of a body (4.212a20). Unlike space, which is a volume co-existent with a body, place is a boundary or surface.

He teaches that, contrary to the Atomists and others, a void is not only unnecessary, but leads to contradictions, e.g., making locomotion impossible.

Time is a constant attribute of movements and, Aristotle thinks, does not exist on its own but is relative to the motions of things. Tony Roark describes Aristotle's view of time as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Aristotle defines time as "a  number of motion with respect to the before and after" (''Phys.'' 219b1–2), by which he intends to denote motion’s susceptibility to division into undetached parts of arbitrary length, a property that it possesses both by virtue of its intrinsic nature and also by virtue of the capacities and activities of percipient souls. Motion is intrinsically indeterminate, but  perceptually determinable, with respect to its length. Acts of perception function as determiners; the result is determinate units of kinetic length, which is precisely what a temporal unit is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roark|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Books V and VI (Ε: 224a–231a; Ζ: 231a–241b)===
Books V and VI deal with ''how'' motion occurs. Book V classifies four species of movement, depending on where the opposites are located.  Movement categories include quantity (e.g. a change in dimensions, from great to small), quality (as for colors: from pale to dark), place (local movements generally go from up downwards and vice versa), or, more controversially, substance. In fact, substances do not have opposites, so it is inappropriate to say that ''something'' properly becomes, from not-man, man: [[On Generation and Corruption|generation and corruption]] are not ''kinesis'' in the full sense.

Book VI discusses how a changing thing can reach the opposite state, if it has to pass through infinite intermediate stages. It investigates by rational and logical arguments the notions of ''continuity'' and ''division'', establishing that change—and, consequently, time and place—are not divisible into indivisible parts; they are not mathematically [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] but continuous, that is, infinitely divisible (in other words, that you cannot build up a continuum out of discrete or indivisible points or moments). Among other things, this implies that there can be no definite (indivisible) moment when a motion begins. This discussion, together with that of speed and the different behavior of the four different species of motion, eventually helps Aristotle answer the famous [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], which purport to show the absurdity of motion's existence.

===Book VII (Η; 241a25–250b7)===
Book VII briefly deals with the relationship of the moved to his mover, which Aristotle describes in substantial divergence with '''[[Plato]]''''s theory of the soul as capable of setting itself in motion (''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' book X, ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'').  Everything which moves is moved by another. He then tries to correlate the species of motion and their speeds, with the local change (locomotion, ''phorà'') as the most fundamental to which the others can be reduced.

Book VII.1-3 also exist in an alternative version, not included in the [[Bekker numbers|Bekker edition]].

===Book VIII (Θ; 250a14–267b26)===
Book VIII (which occupies almost a fourth of the entire ''Physics'', and probably constituted originally an independent course of lessons) discusses two main topics, though with a wide deployment of arguments: the time [[Cosmological argument|limits of the universe]], and the existence of a [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] — eternal, indivisible, without parts and without magnitude. Isn't the universe eternal, has it had a beginning, will it ever end? Aristotle's response, as a Greek, could hardly be affirmative, never having been told of a ''creatio ex nihilo,'' but he also has philosophical reasons for denying that motion had not always existed, on the grounds of the theory presented in the earlier books of the ''Physics''. Eternity of motion is also confirmed by the existence of a substance which is different from all the others in lacking matter; being pure form, it is also in an eternal actuality, not being imperfect in any respect; hence needing not to move. This is demonstrated by describing the celestial bodies thus: the first things to be moved must undergo an infinite, single and continuous movement, that is, circular. This is not caused by any contact but (integrating the view contained in the [[Aristotelian view of God|Metaphysics, bk. XII]]) by love and aspiration.

== Significance to some major modern philosophers and teachers ==
The works of Aristotle are typically considered foundational to Western science and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote=''Aristotle's ''Physics'' is the hidden, and therefore never adequately studied, foundational book of Western philosophy.'' | first=Martin | last=Heidegger | chapter=On the Essence and Concept of φὐσις in Aristotle's ''Physics'' Β, 1 | title=Pathmarks | editor-first=William | editor-last=McNeill | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1998 | pages=183–230, 185}} (Emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt; The citations below are not given as any sort of final modern judgement on the interpretation and significance of Aristotle, but are only the views of some modern notables.

=== Heidegger ===
[[Martin Heidegger]] writes:

{{quote
 | The ''Physics'' is a lecture in which he seeks to determine beings that arise on their own, τὰ φύσει ὄντα, with regard to their being. Aristotelian "physics" is different from what we mean today by this word, not only to the extent that it belongs to antiquity whereas the modern physical sciences belong to modernity, rather above all it is different by virtue of the fact that Aristotle's "physics" is philosophy, whereas modern physics is a positive science that presupposes a philosophy.... This book determines the warp and woof of the whole of Western thinking, even at that place where it, as modern thinking, appears to think at odds with ancient thinking. But opposition is invariably {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a decisive, and often even perilous, dependence. Without Aristotle's ''Physics'' there would have been no [[Galileo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Martin | last=Heidegger | authorlink=Martin Heidegger | title=The Principle of Reason | translator-first=Reginald | translator-last=Lilly | location=Bloomington | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=1991 | series=Studies in Continental Thought | pages=62–63 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWDUmlA6M98C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] says of ''Physics'' and ''[[On the Heavens]]'' (which he believed was a continuation of ''Physics'') that they were:

==The authorship paradox==
According to Diogenes Laertius, The library of the Lyceum at its peak under Aristotle comprised many types of books: works authored by the elders under their names, works authored by elders and young men, signatures uncertain, copies of works written by other authors on research topics, and research results of unspecified form. This same library continues under Theophrastus, acquiring more works of the same type, except that Aristotle is no longer a contributor. On the death of Theophrastus, we are led to believe, the library disappears for 200 years, having been safely abscended by Neleus. Just as suddenly it reappears, having been rescued, cared for by three editors and a powerful aristocrat, to be published in a new recension by Andronicus, and to descend to us this very day as Bekker pages. The paradox is that the recension that descends bears little resemblance to the library at Athens. It contains only books specifically authored by Aristotle with the inclusions of works later shown to be spurious. There are no works of Theophrastus or anyone else and no explanation of what happened to all the other books. The library that was rescued cannot possibly be the one that needed rescuing.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Grote takes note of the problem even before the discovery of the ''Constitution'', which he is embarrassed to relate, he says, considering the credibility invested in Aristotle: {{harvnb|Grote|1970|p=31}} "Here, then, we find several embarrassing facts in regard to the Aristotelian Canon. Most of the works now accepted and known as belonging to Aristotle, are neither included in the full Aristotelian Catalogue given by Diogenes, nor were they known to Cicero; who, moreover, ascribes to Aristotle attributes of style not only different, but opposite, to those which our Aristotle presents."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research at the Lyceum ==
Recent archaeological discoveries at Athens have verified that there was a school in the park called Lyceum and that one of the foundations fits the shape of a rectangular library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Corinne | last=Chandler | title=Aristotle's Lyceum | publisher=Matt Barrett's Athens Survival Guide | url=https://athensguide.com/aristotle-lyceum/index.htm | accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site had in fact still been a park (or garden), and will remain one, according to the Greek government. Study of the ancient sources reveals that, regardless of its legal status, whether owned, rented, or just occupied, an organization did reside there, which called itself "the friends" (''[[philoi]]'') and the establishment "the school (''[[wikt:διατριβή|diatribe]]'') of the friends.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was its own name, or [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]]. It meant that the relationship of belonging to the school was "completely informal." The name ''[[wikt:περιπατητικός|peripatetikoi]]'', those who inhabited the walkways, or ''[[wikt:περίπατος|peripatoi]]'', of the gymnasion in the park, is an exonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The friends lived in a "cooperative" (''[[koinonia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They dined together and together had responsibility for the facilities, including the library and the museum. They paid no one and received no pay from anyone. The expenses for the establishment were assumed by wealthy patrons, one of whom was Aristotle; however, during the time that [[Alexander the Great]] was a friend, there were no financial worries. For all these informalities, they were nevertheless considered to be either "young men" (''neaniskoi'') or "elders" (''[[wikt:πρεσβύτερος|presbuteroi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle, moreover, did have some power, beginning with his position, described by English scholars as [[scholarch|scholiarch]], "ruler of the school."&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;''Scholiarch'' though a useful term in scholarship is a fantasy of the English language. It is based on ''scholarch'', which is used by the classical writers, but so rarely that it does not even appear in the standard Greek dictionaries. The head of a school, such as Plato or Aristotle, is generally called the ''archon'' or ''master'' or the "leader." Aristotle's transference of the title to any friend at random is believed indicative of his humanistic views. He was nevertheless the guiding light, with the power to name Theophrastus as successor.&lt;/ref&gt;  This rule did not include the day-to-day operation of the school, as he instituted the equivalent of a maritime "watch" to take care of that; i.e., every 10 days he appointed an [[archon]], "master," from the friends.

The business of the friends was not merely education in existing knowledge. As is expressed in the first few paragraphs of ''Physics'', they were interested in discovering the principles, or elements of the knowledge, which was an entirely new goal in Greek education. This research was divided into specific "fields" ([[wikt:μέθοδος|methodoi]]). First they collected written works representing the existing knowledge. Subsequently, they collected field data through interviews and specimen-hunting. Aristotle is the first known scientist to have sent out field workers, and to have sent them with military expeditions. Alexander's ethnic and political intelligence gathering as a friend of the school was certainly of greatest value in his ultimate goal, to create a new, multi-cultural world empire. His was the first known army to feature a military historian unit. He was said to have assigned thousands of men to the task of collecting specimens, presumably in addition to their military duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|pp=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final step in a research project was analysis of all the information to ascertain "scientific knowledge" ([[episteme]]) of the "elements" ([[wikt:element|stoicheia]]), the "causes" ([[aitia]]), and the "first principles" ([[wikt:principle|archai]]) of the topic. These were written in a new type of document, which has survived in the ''corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;It has been called a "systematic treatise" in modern times: {{harvnb|Corazzon|2016|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with a brief survey of the previous views, it launched into the definitions and conclusions in a style similar to a geometric presentation. The papers were then stored in the library. Their authors, analysts, contributors, whether or not they were emended, or corrected, and by whom, remain unknown for certain. Diogenes Laertius called these "notebooks" (hypomnemata) and said that Aristotle wrote "an unusual number."

== The question of the library ==
=== Transition from cooperative to private school ===
According to [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Strabo | title=Geography 13.1.54 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D13%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D54}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neleus of Scepsis|Neleus, son of Coriscus]], a friend at the Lyceum, "inherited the library ([[wikt:bibliotheke|bibliotheke]]) of [[Theophrastus]], which included that of Aristotle."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Novak|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theophrastus received Aristotle's library by being bequeathed it along with the school. Theophrastus was the first book collector, as far as Strabo knew. Apparently, the elders owned their own libraries and could dispose of them as they pleased.

The main problems with this view are, first of all, that Aristotle's Will survives credibly in [[Diogenes Laërtius|
Diogenes Laertius']] (D.L.'s) ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' under ''Aristotle''. There is not one word about a library. Moreover, Aristotle, a [[metic]], or foreign resident of Athens, was not allowed to own property or bequeath it, so he could not have either owned the school with its library or have left it to anyone by legal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Novak|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if he were not a metic, he could not have disposed of the land and buildings, which were municipal property.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;A speculative theory by Baltussen supposes that the location outside the walls relieved the metics of their rights and responsibilities as metics making it possible for Aristotle to own the school, justifying Strabo: {{cite book | first=Hans | last=Baltussen | title=The Peripatetics: Aristotle's Heirs 322 BCE - 200 CE | location=New York; Abingdon | publisher=Routledge | year=2016 | chapter=Aristotle's Heirs | page=2 | quote=The Lykeion was located outside the city walls because as a metic (non-Athenian, 'immigrant') Aristotle was not allowed to own property in the city of Athens.}} On the contrary, the only thing the location got him was a beautiful park, a spring, a ready-made gymnasion, and a place to put a zoo and botanical garden, as the walls were a recent military defense and not any sort of border. The Academics used the park quite a lot. A recent study of the status of metics based on Athenian orations and passages from historians may be found in {{cite thesis | first=Matthew John | last=Kears | title=Metics and Identity in Democratic Athens | year=2013 | degree=PhD | location=Birmingham, GB | publisher=University of Birminham | url=http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5046/1/Kears14PhD.pdf}} According to Kears, the ancient requirement for citizenship was being autochthonous, "of the land," which was [[Attica]] and not some small area defined by wall. The citizens were registered in demes, or districts, throughout it. The law required both parents to be autochthonous.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the other friends could either. According to the laws in effect on the day Aristotle died, no one could own or bequeath the school to anyone. The city owned it. As to whether Aristotle and Theophrastus had additional personal libraries of their own, first, private ownership was not in the spirit of the school, and second, the fate of the school after Theophrastus suggests that the library was in fact the school library.

After the death of Alexander, Athens staged a brief revolt against the Macedonians. Turning their attention to the school, they went after Aristotle, who went into exile to escape the death penalty. He died in exile. Within a few years Athens was again under Macedon ruled by [[Cassander]]. Theophrastus returned in triumph to the school under the authority of the new vice-regent of Athens, [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], a friend of the school and former student of Theophrastus. The school became even greater than before, but Demetrius made some changes to the administration. D.L. says only that Theophrastus "is said to have become the owner of a garden of his own after Aristotle's death, through the intervention of his friend, Demetrius of Phalerum." Apparently D.L. does not quite understand his source. The meaning was not "his friend." This was not a personal favor. A "friend" is an associate of the school. There were not two gardens; Theophrastus was not a poor man in need of some property of his own. His extensive will details the disposition of the assets of the school as his own property, including the garden. He names the friends and wants to make sure that they understand the ownership is to be treated as joint. Demetrius had simply instituted the legal convention prevalent at other schools of having the master own the school and its assets.

The very disposition of the property in Theophrastus' will is an attempt to restore the koinonia established by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Millett | year=1991 | title=Lending and borrowing in ancient Athens | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden, the walks, and the buildings around the garden are to go to ten named friends,&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Callinus, Demotimus, Demaratus, Callisthenes, Melantes, Pancreon, and Nicippus, with rights also to Aristotle, grandson of Aristotle, then a child. Most are not known further to the sources.&lt;/ref&gt; to be held in common, provided they use the property for the study of literature and philosophy. This is provisional ownership. If the provisions are not met, the property must revert to someone by law, probably the proprietor, or owner, of the school. The total property of Theophrastus as proprietor was much larger. The family estate at [[Eresos|Eresus]] and the Aristotelian property at [[Stagira]] went to individual friends. He also owned funds in trust managed by Hipparchus. The latter was enjoined to use them to rebuild the museum and other buildings. He also had slaves in his possession (as had Aristotle). They were either set free or given to friends. He had one [[freedman]] client, whom he rewarded richly for four more years of maintaining the buildings.

=== Abscondence of the library by Neleus ===
The will contains one more bequest that is rather peculiar. It has a bearing on the nature of the ''Corpus'', whether it is Aristotle's, Aristotle's and Theophrastus', or of all the friends. There is as yet no solution to the problem of authorship, or rather lack of it. Ancient sources on the topic are inconsistent. There is no general scholarly consensus and no agreed preponderance of evidence.

The will relates in translation "The whole of my library I give to Neleus." The heart of the school was its library, containing all the research results and analytical papers (the notebooks). Without it the friends could not produce current or meaningful lectures about the topics for which the school was known (physics, rhetoric, etc.) All the other school property was being redistributed to the friends in common (except that the foreign estates were given individual owners, probably for their management, while the slaves and the minor received individual guardians), but the heart of the school, without which it could not pump knowledge, was not to be common property, an anomalous approach for the circumstances. No explanation at all is to be found in ancient sources. The moderns almost universally retrieve one explanation, that Neleus was the intended heir of the archonship, although that, strangely, is nowhere suggested. The law still required an archon with property rights over the school.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is to be found in most books on the topic. As an example, see {{harvnb|Watson|2012|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the implied expectation, Neleus did not become the scholiarch; instead, [[Strato of Lampsacus]] did. Again, there are no details of how or why he acquired the position or any statement of Neleus's feelings about it, inviting speculation.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;One popular speculation has Neleus losing an election to Strato ({{harvnb|Lynch|2010|p=81}}). The school was not democratic. Aristotle never held elections. The first proprietor to request replacement by election in his will was Lyco, but he had the option of requesting it or not. There was no expectation or process in place. The peripatetics did not share in the Athenian ideal as they were not Athenian. Certainly, the Macedonians, who were friends, decided nothing by democracy, yet it would be hard to find a figure as democratic in his relationships as Alexander. He listened to everyone within reason. When he had made up his mind, it was dangerous to oppose him.&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo then relates what is universally considered an act of perfidy against the school. He was given the library with the understanding that it would be shared as common property. Instead "Neleus took it to Skepsis and bequeathed it to his heirs, ordinary people, who kept the books locked up ...." The result, according to Strabo, was that the school "... had no books at all, with the exception of only a few, ... and were therefore able ... only to talk bombast about commonplace propositions ...." No details or motives are given. Speculations are rife.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;One school of speculations is exculpatory, as in the following example: {{cite book | first=Rudolph | last=Blum | translator-first=Hans H. | translator-last=Wellisch | year=1991 | title=Kallimachos: The Alexandrian Library and the Origins of Bibliography | location=Madison | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | page=61 | quote=Perhaps he wanted to found a school himself ... That was of course a loss ... but not a catastrophe, because the members ... certainly had copies.}} To the contrary, no school was ever founded, and Blum is suggesting a duplicate library concept, which is in no way stated or implied by any source. It seems logical that some friends had copies of individual books in which they were interested, but a number of sources indicate a library in the thousands of books, which leads to the legitimate question of whether Neleus removed the entire library.&lt;/ref&gt; Every author has something to say, some judgement to render.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Jacob proposes the books were willed to Neleus' family, who were ''idiotoi anthropoi'', "uneducated men," as a "long-term investment" in rare books: {{cite book | first=Christian | last=Jacob | chapter=Fragments of a history of ancient libraries | editor1-first=Jason | editor1-last=König |  editor2-first=Katerina | editor2-last=Oikonomopoulou | editor3-first=Greg | editor3-last=Woolf | title=Ancient Libraries | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2013 | page=70}} But, the growing community of book collectors only knew the value of the books because they were educated men. The relatives could have been informed by Neleus, but this thought is a speculation on a speculation. By Strabo's report, the books were kept for several generations and sold in dilapidated, partly unreadable condition to Apellicon for an unrefusable price only after persuasion. In another example, Theophrastus allocates funds in his will for the repair of recent vandalism to the museum: {{harvnb|Watson|2012|p=273}}. Watson hypothesizes that Neleus removed the books to protect them. The ruination of the entire school to protect its library seems pointless.&lt;/ref&gt; All are conscious of the fact that, were it not for this perfidy, there would be no ''corpus'' as it is known today.

Strabo's anecdote is not the sole ancient authority on Neleus' disposition of the books. [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], in his work [[Deipnosophistae]], "Dinner Sophists," an imaginary portrayal of a series of banquets at which the guests are famous literary figures of the past (over 700), so that the reader is served up menus and snippets of sophistry together, has his main character, the host, ''Laurentius'' ("Lawrence") possessing 
:"such a library of ancient Greek books, as to exceed in that respect all those who are remarkable for such collections; such as ... Aristotle the philosopher, and Nelius his librarian; from whom they say that our countryman Ptolemæus, surnamed Philadelphus, bought them all, and transported them with all those which he had collected at Athens and at Rhodes to his own beautiful Alexandria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Athenaeus | author-link=Athenaeus | translator-first=C.D. | translator-last=Yonge | title=The Deipnosophists. Or Banquet Of The Learned Of Athenaeus | location=London | publisher=Henry G. Bohn | year=1854 | chapter=Book I Chapter 4 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2013.01.0003%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the rules of logic (Aristotle's very rules) both accounts may not be received as "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," as the American legal principle for courtroom testimony requires. The easiest solution would be to drop one in favor of the other, and many authors take it. The remaining solution is to accept both as partially true, creating a window of opportunity for speculatory explanation of differences between the Alexandrian and Skepsian traditions.

=== The dual tradition of texts ===
====The ambiguous name, Corpus Aristotelicum====
The tradition best known to moderns is the ''Corpus Aristotelicum'', [[New Latin]] for "Aristotelic body," a term not used by Bekker. The Prussian Academy published his 1831 edition under the name ''Aristoteles Graece'', "Aristotle in Greek," where Aristoteles is the [[nominative case]]. In most Latin and New Latin book titles the author is in the [[genitive case]], such as ''Aristotelis Opera'', "the works of Aristotle." Individual works are so named by Bekker, but none of this is any sort of ''corpus''.

In the late 19th century the ''corpus'' phrase began to appear in the notes of the German historians of philosophy, such as [[Eduard Zeller|Zeller]] and [[Wilhelm Windelband|Windelband]].&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Zeller|1897a|p=40}} "We should look to find in Andronicus's edition those writings above all that are included in our extant Corpus Aristotelicum, which is derived, speaking broadly, from his own." The only comprehensive ''corpus'' he could possibly mean was Bekker's, by then the standard.&lt;/ref&gt; By implication they meant Bekker, but even as they wrote a new manuscript was being excavated from the trash-heaps of Egypt about which Bekker knew nothing at all, or anyone else for at least a few thousand years: the [[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)]].&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;One of the 4th-century [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]. It was matched to a papyrus in the British Museum purchased from Cairo bearing the ''Constitution'' on one side and some 1st-century Egyptian business accounts on the other. The total find circumstances are related in the ''Introduction'' to Loeb L285, which is in the public domain and can be downloaded at {{cite web | first=Ryan | last=Baumann | title=Loebolus | url=https://ryanfb.github.io/loebolus/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was identified as being one of 158 political studies written by Aristotle and his students no earlier than 330 BC. It is in the "notebook" format. The content differs in that it is not an abstract treatise but is a history stating periods and dates. Not being able to fit it into an idea of the ''corpus'' based on Bekker, many rejected it. The date being quite ancient, the majority view is to accept it as of Alexandrian provenience, the only instance of an Aristotelicum from the library and school there.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;If Strabo's and Athenaeus' traditions are taken as purely true, the ''Constitution of the Athenians'' ought not to exist. Either it was not among the books that went to Skepsis (not being in Bekker) or it was destroyed by the first great fire among the books at Alexandria. The typical compromise solution is expressed by Sandys as follows: {{cite book | author=Aristotle | editor-first=John Edwin | editor-last=Sandys | editor-link=John Sandys (classicist) | title=Aristotle's Constitution of Athens: a revised text with an introduction, critical and explanatory notes, testimonia and indices | edition=Second | location=London | publisher=MacMillan and Co. | year=1912 | page=xxv | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVEzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg | quote=But, to shew that the fate of Aristotle’s writings did not entirely depend on the fortunes of the library buried in the vault at Scépsis, we have abundant proof of some of them being familiar to the philosophic world during the interval in which his library itself was lost to view; and it is probable that many of them, including those of more general interest, were at an early date transcribed at Athens and thence transmitted to the great library at Alexandria.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of the ''Constitution of the Athenians'' with the same credibility as the Bekkerian ''corpus'' lends a certain ambiguity to the meaning of ''corpus''. If it is to be only the works in Bekker, then such misleading phrases as "the original corpus" are possible, as though the works in Bekker are more authentic than any works out of it. Not even the works in Bekker are authentic beyond any doubt.

The next logical step is to attempt to modify the definition of the term so that it is not to be the Latin word ''corpus'' but some special use of it:
:"The Corpus Aristotelicum is the collection of Aristotle's works that have survived from antiquity through Medieval manuscript transmission. ... Reference to them is made according to Immanuel Bekker's nineteenth-century Royal Prussian Academy edition ... which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Aristotle | author2=Plato | editor=Catholic Way Publishing | title=Aristotle, Plato | chapter=Corpus Aristotelicum | series=The Philosophy Collection [97 Books] | year=2015 | location=London | publisher=Catholic Way Publishing Company | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaP0CAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=corpus%20aristotelicum&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has such authority that it may not be used without meaning Bekker's collection, but it may be used to mean additional Aristotelica. It is often translated as "the works of Aristotle." In that English sense it ought to mean every work ever attributed to Aristotle as well as every fragment. George Grote had said 
:"Very different is the case when we attempt to frame an Aristotelian Canon, comprising all the works of Aristotle and none others. We find the problem far more complicated, and the matters of evidence at once more defective, more uncertain, and more contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grote|1880|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By "canon" Grote meant "the Berlin edition of Aristotle." He is totally innocent of any Aristotelian ''corpora''. Even if "canon" had survived instead of ''corpus'', such a meaning now would fail to distinguish Bekker. One translational solution is just to name Bekker, as in "Bekker pages." Such an elevation of Bekker as the authority raises the question of the source of this aura of conviction surrounding the name. It seems likely that it was inherent in the sources.

====The paper trail before Bekker====
Having determined to print all of Aristotle's authentic works, as far as could be ascertained, Bekker found himself looking back over a voluminous paper trail.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;For a view of the world of MSS such as was seen by Bekker, see {{cite web | title=aristotle original manuscripts | url=https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=aristotle+original+manuscripts&amp;chips=q:aristotle+original+manuscripts,online_chips:arabic,online_chips:al+farabi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8mpXk65fYAhWD8YMKHds0D5YQ4lYIKCgA&amp;biw=1000&amp;bih=731&amp;dpr=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to use the texts found in 102 manuscripts (MSS), routinely identified by library name and access number. For use in the book, he gave each MS a letter code. These appear in the footnotes. The front material of the edition includes a list of MSS. His libraries are relatively few, including the [[Vatican Library]] at Rome, the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] at Venice, the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] (formerly the Royal Library of Paris), and the [[Austrian National Library]] at Vienna. Typically the Aristotelica are included in famous MSS publishing a number of works.&lt;ref&gt;See in the category list at the bottom of the page under Aristotelian manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bekker did not seek out all possible MSS. The number of MSS still extant remains unknown. Before the invention of the [[printing press]] ca. 1440 by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], who combined [[moveable type]] with a [[screw press]], book reproduction was performed by copyists. It went on everywhere in institutions that could afford to undertake it.

In the 15th century copying slowed as the MSS were replaced by books. Due to cultural lag, some MSS production continued as late as the 17th century in the form of written books. For the most part the MSS were left where they were. Since Bekker, many previously unconsidered MSS have turned up. Their publication is ongoing.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Bekker's labor in having to peronally visit institutions to view MSS in person undoubtedly limited the number of MSS he could view. Today most of the larger MSS collectors, including the ones visited by Bekker, have adopted a system of digitizing MSS and making them available online, often as a free public service. For example, refer to {{cite web | title=Modern Language Translations of Byzantine Sources: Digitized Greek Manuscripts | url=http://library.princeton.edu/byzantine/manuscript-title-list?field_city_tid=All&amp;field_library_tid=All&amp;field_collection_tid=All&amp;field_number_tid=&amp;field_subject_theme_tid=2509&amp;field_subject_name_tid=2510&amp;field_script_tid=All&amp;field_century_ms__tid=All&amp;field_high_resolution_value=All | publisher=Princeton University Library | accessdate=20 December 2017}} Some knowledge of [[palaeography]] is required to read these.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on them, works considered spurious are now believed genuine, and vice versa. The jury is always out, so to speak.

The date of a copy is to be distinguished from the date of its recension. Most Aristotle MSS were copied during centuries 13-15 at various [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] in Europe. The sequence of text is the recension, which might be instanced by many copies at diverse locations. The recension is not just the text, but is all the idiosyncrasies, such as a specific set of errors (miscopies, misspellings or variant texts), associated with it. The similarities or differences make possible the reconstruction of a [[tree of descent]] by the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] defining families of MSS, each designated by a capital letter. A family also is a recension. Its first member is its original. Typically originals are not available now but their existence and date can be predicated from different types of historical and textual evidence.

Excluding anomalous archaeological finds, all the MSS copied most lately date to after 1000. Historical and internal clues point to originals in the last 3 centuries before 1000 and a provenience of the domain of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; that is, the Greek-speaking world as it was under the eastern Roman Empire. The [[crusaders]] broke the power of its capital city, [[Constantinople]], leaving it helpless before the [[saracen]]s, in this case the Turkish-language speakers from the plains of Central Asia, who became the [[Ottoman Turks]]. They soon colonized Anatolia, occupying the urban centers there and replacing the Greek-speakers, who escaped to Greece. As they were not much interested in copying Greek MSS, the task of transmitting them to posterity passed to Europe. (The Turkish people today have an abiding interest in antiquities). The Arabic-speaking saracens to the south after an initial zealous destruction of antiquities, including starting yet another fire in the library of Alexandria, seemed to be infused with the same magic of Aristotle and Alexander that had captured the Roman conquerors of Anatolia earlier. They began to translate Aristotle into Arabic, now the only source of some Aristotelica.

Hand-written MSS of Aristotle are missing from the 1st half of the 1st millennium. The ongoing sites of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and the [[Villa of the Papyri]] offer hope of the discovery of fragments outside the ''corpus'' tradition. Meanwhile, the [[commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries]], or explanations of the content of the ''corpus'', supply quotations and paraphrases filling in the gap. These ''lemmata'', or excerpts, are so close to the ''corpus'' that they can be assigned Bekker numbers, which is good evidence that ''corpus'' has been accepted as the work of Aristotle since the beginning of the Roman Empire. The ''corpus'' is universally attributed to a single recension, that of [[Andronicus of Rhodes]], dated to mid-1st-century BC, in the late Roman Republic. The diagnostic of Andronicus' work is the division of the text into treatises, the names of some of the treatises, and the order and grouping of the treatises. Any work that does not conform to that diagnostic is immediately suspected of being "spurious" or non-authentic; that is, not of the ''corpus'' and not of Aristotle (rightly or wrongly).

====Recension of Apellicon====
In the story by Strabo, after Neleus has removed the books to Skepsis — many thousands in broad daylight on a caravan of wagons and in a fleet of ships, without objection or notice of any officials at Athens or Skepsis — history knows no more of him, even though he must have had plans for the books. Evidently the plans did not materialize. To take the passage literally, he must have died shortly thereafter, as the relatives received disposition of the property willed to them (the books).

The books arrived at Skepsis and were stored in a large outbuilding at what must have been a country estate, as the space requirements would not have changed any since Athens. The few small rooms of an ordinary dwelling in town would not have been suitable. Perhaps the relatives were not so poor and uneducated as depicted. As one man could not possibly have moved an entire library by himself, Neleus must have had a retinue of servants.

Hearing that [[Eumenes II]], the [[Attalid dynasty|Attalid]] king of [[Pergamon]], was hunting books, the Corascid family "hid their books underground in a kind of trench." The king must not even have suspected the presence of a huge underground cache at Skepsis, as kings have methods of investigation and confiscation not available to ordinary citizens. Apparently the king's system of "eyes and ears," so well developed under Alexander, failed totally, that an entire building full of books could have been received and buried without him being informed. Moreover, the event remained a family secret for the next 200 years.

Ordinary people do not keep property and family memory for so long, but the story is the story, and apart from the alternative by Athenaeus, is the only one available. Speculative answers are always possible.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;{{cite book | title=Aristotle: His Life and School | first=Carlo | last=Natali | location=Princeton | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2013 | page=150 | quote=It is much more probable, in my opinion, ... that the second collection of Aristotle's books (the ''corpus'') never left Athens, but was neglected by later peripatetics ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general view is that Neleus only brought, and his family only hid, a small part of a library that had already otherwise been sold.

For the next event in the creation of the ''corpus'' the historical clock must be advanced from the accession of [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]] as scholiarch (instead of Neleus) at 286 BC&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;D.L. states the dates in [[Olympiad]]s, in this case 123, which is 288-284 BC. The central date comes from R.D. Hicks, translator and editor of {{cite web | title=Loeb 184 | url=https://ryanfb.github.io/loebolus/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the confiscation of the first recension of the re-discovered ''corpus'' from the home of the deceased re-discoverer, {{nowrap|[[Apellicon of Teos]],&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;There are four sources on Apellicon: 1) Persons 1343 and 1363 containing fragments of [[Posidonius]], {{cite book | editor-first=Johannes | editor-last=Kirschner | title=Prosographia Attica | volume=1 | location=Berolini | publisher=Typis et Impensis Georgii Reimeri | language=Ancient Greek, Latin | year=1901 | pages=93, 95 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5npfAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source}} 2) {{cite web | title=Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, Chapter 5 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2013.01.0003%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3Dpos%3D390 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library}} 3) {{cite web | title=Plutarch, Sulla, Chapter 26 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0064%3Achapter%3D26 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library}} 4) {{cite web | title=Strabo, Geography, 13.1.54 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D13%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D54}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} by general [[Sulla]] on his return to Athens after his conquest of Anatolia in 84 BC. For that approximately 200 years, Strabo would have us believe, the scholars of the Lyceum were a simple folk, unable to understand, repeat, or reconstruct the work of Aristotle, nor could they add to any of the previous investigations without his guidance. Moreover, when they finally did obtain a glimpse into what they believed were the words of the master, the only scholarly activities of which they were capable were trying to puzzle out what they mean. Whatever this condition might have been, it certainly was not science. Considering the activities of some of the graduates, there has been some grounds for thinking the Lyceum was gone, and the property was being held by greedy charlatans utilizing the name of peripatetic as a mask. Athenaeus tells the story of "Athenion the Peripatetic philosopher" (a contemporary of Apellicon),
:"in order that we may come to a thorough understanding and appreciation of those men who profess to be philosophers, and that we may not be taken in by their ragged cloaks and unshaven chins."

The men to whom he refers did not wear ragged cloaks; they were among the richest in Athens, but they were so because they were charlatans, or, as would be said today, "crooks." The school and the society in which it had been placed were different now. The [[diadochi]] were gone, or nearly so, including the [[Attalids]]. The eastern Mediterranean was divided into provinces of the [[Roman Republic]], except that [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] was successfully contesting Roman rule in Anatolia. The citizenship laws at Athens had changed somewhat. Athenion's mother had been an Egyptian slave owned by his father, and yet based on his father's citizenship he was enrolled as a citizen and inherited his father's estate. [[Apellicon of Teos|Apellicon]] (not an Athenian name), an immigrant from [[Teos]] in Asia MInor, was enrolled as a citizen after his adoption into the family of Aristotle, son of Apolexis.

The fact that the family included two members named Aristotle leads to the suggestion that the adoptive family had connections to the Lyceum and that Apellicon learned of the books through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=T.Keith | last=Dix | chapter=Aristotle's 'Peripatetic' Library | editor-first=James | editor-last=Raven | title=Lost Libraries: The Destruction of Great Book Collections Since Antiquity | location=New York | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year=2004 | page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, references in the sources to Apellicon and Athenion as "peripatetics" may well be interpreted as meaning that they both went to the Lyceum, which would explain why they were later comrades-in-arms. The peripatetics never had a predictable philosophy. Both men were skilled orators, which was a specialty of the school at that time. Athenion went on to found a chain of schools for boys, on which account he is called a "sophist" (a teacher of conventional wisdom). Apellicon turned his love for books into something conceded to have been illegal for the times:
:"For at one time he was a philosopher, and collected all the treatises of the Peripatetics, and the whole library of Aristotle, and many others; for he was a very rich man; and he had also stolen a great many autograph decrees of the ancients out of the temple of the Mighty Mother, and whatever else there was ancient and taken care of in other cities; and being detected in these practices at Athens he would have been in great danger if he had not made his escape"

As there is no indication that the Apolexidis family were fabulously wealthy or that, being numerous, they had much to leave to their adopted son, Apellicon very likely made his money from the resale of rare documents he acquired for nothing except the cost of stealing them. These were the originals of the decrees, first written on paper and signed before they were carved in stone for public benefit. In describing the ideal library of "Lawrence," Athenaeus points out that even then historians were expected to verify their claims against public documents. In one source Apellicon himself had written a book on Aristotle. Initially he might have yielded to the temptation to walk away with the source rather than return it to display in the temple. Becoming rich through the sale of stolen documents he decided to redeem the old cache, which was said to have been hidden not far from his home town.

Examining the books, and finding that moths and mold had removed portions of the text, Apellicon created another recension, supplying the missing information himself. There is no indication of how much was missing or of what source Apellicon used, if any, or whether the supplied material was grammatical, orthographic, or epigraphic, or included philosophy as well. Subsequent editors judged his recension to have been full of errors, but no ancient source has said what sort of errors, or how they were judged to be errors. These editors made corrections, but the sources of information used for correction remain unknown. In short, the only thing known from ancient sources is that Apellicon made a recension that was later criticised for being erroneus. The contradiction of such a statement is that if they knew enough to correct Apellicon, why would the rediscovery of the books have added anything different to the obviously already known ''corpus''?&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;There is no credible answer not entirely speculative. Speculations are easily made, such as that some texts were known, or the errors were of an epigraphic character only. Proof awaits further discoveries. A popular speculation is that Apellicon as a book dealer was too ignorant to have attempted a recension; therefore, he did not. There is nothing in book dealers, however, that makes them per se ignorant.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage from Athenaeus also provides a rough time table for the recension of Apellicon. It was created toward the end of his years as a successful thief, presumably at his home in Athens. What happened to the damaged originals remains a total mystery. Perhaps they were repasted and sold. How many copies were made if any, and who got them, also is not known. Apellicon probably left town in such a hurry that the books remained in Athens under the care of friends or servants. There is no record that the city moved against his property. Thus in a short time when he returned under the protection of Athenion he took up residence in the same home housing the same library, which was found there by Sulla after Apellicon's death.

====Sulla's victory over the peripatetics====
In the pages of Athenaeus, evil men come to a bad end, and the peripatetics are not good men. These were shortly to be tested in the [[First Mithridatic War]] with disastrous results.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Their rise to power is detailed in {{cite web | title=Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, Book V, Chapter 28 (Ath.5.pos=385) - 53 (pos.=390) | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ath.+5.pos%3D385&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2013.01.0003}} Their fall is described in {{cite web | title=Plutarch, Sulla, Chapters 12-26 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+Sull.+12&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0064L}}. Complementary detail is given in Plutarch's ''Lucullus''. Another valuable source differs in some major detail from Plutarch: {{cite web | title=Appian, Mithridatic Wars, Chapters 3-6 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0230%3Atext%3DMith.%3Achapter%3D3%3Asection%3D20 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library}} Plutarch is generally preferred, because he claims to have had access to Sulla's ''Memoirs'' (now missing). Appian, however, fills in some gaps in Plutarch, even though sometimes variant.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bithynia and Pontus]] were independent kingdoms descending from Persian satrapies on the southern coast of the [[Black Sea]] never taken by Alexander. The descendants of the [[satrap]]s remained as the Nicomedid and Mithridatid dynasties respectively.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Use of the -id suffix to designate a dynasty is an English-language fantasy. In Homer it is the predominant patronymic, but only there. Ancient Greek had many methods of designating patronymic. Today's uses are generally not Greek and not substantiated, but the terms are useful as formed nouns; for example, Mithridatids is all the kings in a descent named Mithridates. Not enough cultural data survives to know what they really used, if anything, possibly nothing to do with Mithridates. The numbers after the kings similarly are English ideas, while the knicknames were assigned as convenient identifiers by historians. For example, Ptolemy I Soter did not know he was to be either I or Soter.&lt;/ref&gt; Walking a fine diplomatic balance they managed to coexist with the reigning diadochi (Attalids, Seleucids, etc.), but they made war on each other. When the diadochi were replaced by Roman provincial governors,  [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] attacked [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]], claiming tort at the hands of Nicomedes supported by Rome, and further developing an Anatolian alliance defeated all the Roman commanders, massacring as well the helpless Roman citizens. Rome could not ignore these events.

=====Revolution at Athens=====
The rise of Mithridates offered some hope of independence to the cities of Greece. The Athenian people made Athenion the ambassador to Mithridates on the basis of his skill at oratory and experience of the east. Mithridates had other ideas. Winning the ambassador by banquets and promises he sent him back to Athens, where he set up headquarters in front of the [[Stoa of Attalus]]. The Roman officers were accustomed to address the people at that location. After a running harangue, voting to declare independence, the Athenians elected Athenion as commander-in-chief of their armed forces. The historians refer to him as a [[tyrant]].

The wealthy made it clear that the vote had not been theirs by attempting to escape the city. Posting a guard on the gates and dispatching cavalry to hunt the escapees Athenion held a sequence of drum-head trials for treason of which the result was always the same: death and confiscation of property. Athenaeus' account of other peripatetic tyrants at this time makes it clear that the issue was ideologic, the redistribution of wealth. Athenaeus, however, portrays it as thievery due to greed. He says that Athenion "collected such a quantity of money as to fill several wells." Furthermore, he was lavish in his expenditures. Whether the motives were ideologic or personal is a difficult question to answer either then or now, but Athenion went to extremes. He took to torture to extort money. A curfew was set. The economy declined from want. Rationing was instituted.

Athenion replaced all the magistrates with his own men. Choosing this moment to return to Athens, Apellicon was welcomed as an old comrade. Athenion sent him to [[Delos]] in command of a force with instructions to recapture the Athenian national treasury there and bring the money to Athens. It is peculiar that the force he was given is more of a mob than a detachment of soldiers, and that Apellicon evidences total ignorance of military matters. Landing on the shore at night they encamp without a palisade, fail to set a proper watch, and proceed to drink into the small hours. The commander of the Roman guard, [[Orobius]], leads his soldiers into the camp, slaughters 600 men, takes another 400 captive, and hunts the escapees through the countryside, burning them up in their hiding places. Better at running than fighting, Apellicon manages to escape to Athens, where he disappears from politics, at least in the sources, until the brief notice of his death, apparently not of interest to Sulla until then.

On either side, victory depended on intervention. The Pontians moved first. Accompanying his fleet commander, [[Archelaus (general)|Archelaus]], as admiral Mithridates sails to [[Rhodes]] with his entire fleet. Lucius Cassius, [[Proconsul]] of Asia, had escaped to the fortified harbor in the city of the same name there with whatever refugees he could locate. All the Italians had been struck on a day pre-arranged by Mithridates. Their property was seized by [[Asset forfeiture|forfeit]] under pretext of being for the public good, a motive that Appian, like Athenaeus, tears to shreds. The friends of Mithridates revelled in riches. Their cause was amply funded. Commanding from a state [[quinquereme]], Mithridates throws all his naval resources at Rhodes. Failing to take the place, he retreats to his headquarters at [[Pergamon]], instructing Archelaus to complete the conquest of the [[Cyclades]]. Archelaus overwhelms Delos, sending the treasury back to Athens with one Aristion under guard of 2000 men. He then anchors at [[Piraeus]], fortifies [[Munichia]], and uses the place as a headquarters, sending out forays to subdue new islands and new coastal cities. During this time Aristion is tyrant of Athens, and no more is heard of Athenion.

The sources on these two men are again contradictory. They are both tyrants of Athens. Athenaeus uses "Athenion," as did his source, [[Posidonius]], without mention of "Aristion." Pausanias, Appian, and Plutarch refer to "Aristion" without mentioning "Athenion." The main difference is that Athenion is a peripatetic, while Aristion is an [[Epicureanism|epicurean]]. The scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], proposed without further evidence that they were the same man, that, enrolling as a citizen, Athenion changed his name to Aristion (there was one other instance of the practice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |  last=Cotton | first=George Edward Lynch | year=1870 | title=Aristion | editor-last=Smith | editor-first=William | encyclopedia=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology | volume=Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference continued to be troubling, as the two philosophies were at upposite poles: the Epicureans were [[Atomism|atomists]] following [[Democritus]], while the peripatetics were [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphs]], following [[Plato]]. The sources would have known the difference, even just to be men of letters.

In 1935 fragments of a monument were excavated from the [[Ancient Agora of Athens]], which when joined formed part of a decree (I 2351) establishing a new government at Athens. According to Woodhead,

:”... officials have been chosen by lot or direct election, and a Constitution is being ratified by the ''demos''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=A. Geoffrey | last=Woodhead | title=Inscriptions: the Decrees | series=The Athenian Agora | volume=Volume XVI | year=1997 | location=Princetom | publisher=American School of Classical Studies at Athens | pages=467–469}}. The inscription can be found online at {{cite web | title=Agora XVI 333 |url=http://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/233282?&amp;bookid=395&amp;location=1365 | publisher=The Packard Humanities Institute | website=Searchable Greek Inscriptions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A first analysis dated the Constitution to 84/83 BC, the time of Sulla’s visit after reaching an agreement with Mithridates. On subsequent revision of the text J.H. Oliver noticed that two of the provisions were so close to recommendations in Aristotle’s ''Politics'' that Bekker numbers could be {{nowrap|assigned.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Aristotle 1320b lines 11-14 recommends the combination of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]] and [[oligarchy]] for the most balanced form of government, to be implemented by two types of magistrates, those chosen by lot (democratic) and those chosen by vote (oligarchic). I 2351 Line 9 places the government in the hands of those chosen by “[[sortition|lot]]” (''kleros'') and by “election” (''cheirotonia'', “show of hands,” not the Christian “laying on of hands”). Aristotle 1294a lines 41-42 recommends the “common or middle term” between democracy and oligarchy. I 2351 Line 14 is establishing the ''koine kai mese politeia'', direct quote.&lt;/ref&gt;}} As a peripatetic constitution would not be being restored in 84 BC after the final overthrow of the peripatetics. Oliver redates it to 87/86 BC suggesting that the author was a peripatetic; that is, Athenion with his friends. Furthermore, I 2351 is strong evidence that the recension of Apellicon was in fact close to the ''corpus Aristotelicum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Borja | last=Antela-Bernardez | title=Between Medeios and Mithridates: The Peripatetic Constitution Of Athens (Agora I 2351) | journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik | year=210 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277952468_BETWEEN_MEDEIOS_A_N_D_MITHRIDATES_THE_PERIPATETIC_CONSTITUTION_OF_ATHENS_AGORA_I_2351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antela-Bernardez suggests that after the Delian debacle Mithridates sacked all the peripatetics and elevated his own man, Aristion, to tyrant.

=====Civil war at Rome=====
On the Roman side, the [[Asiatic Vespers]] (the massacre)  resulted in an immediate declaration of war.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;They were perhaps less ethnic than military: the [[Marian Reforms]] of 107 BC had opened the army to propertyless men and provided that at the end of a successful career veterans receive free land, notably in foreign countries. Communities of veterans were becoming an indispensable adjunct to Roman bases.&lt;/ref&gt; Elections were due for the year 88 BC, which began January first. [[Sulla]] and [[Quintus Pompeius Rufus (consul 88 BC)|Rufus]] (“red”) stood for [[consul]]es and won (see [[List of Roman consuls]]). Rufus’ son, an officer under Sulla, had asked for Cornelia’s (Sulla’s eldest daughter’s) hand in marriage and won, a marriage which ended tragically. Sulla himself made a marriage with the daughter of the Chief Priest (Pontfex Maximus). The two consules cast lots for the major obligations, as required by law. Sulla won prosecution of the Mithridatic War.

These electoral victories represent a break-away from the political machine of which [[Gaius Marius]] was boss. He headed the [[Populares]] party; Sulla and Rufus were of the [[Optimates]]. Marius had nevertheless until now sponsored the career of Sulla. Born to the aristocratic [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]], Sulla was said to have had a way with women. His step-mother left him her fortune. He married into more wealth. His personal name, Sulla, was actually a food dish of white cheese sprinkled over a red sauce (pizza?) giving the same appearance as his face. He had joined a troupe of comedians who sang and danced making a mockery of famous people, leaving that to enter government service under Marius’ sponsorship. His taking for himself a position Marius had hoped to control was an unforgivable betrayal.

The animosity between them had begun previously when the ambitious Sulla ran for [[Praetor]], lost, ran again, bought some votes and won, to be ridiculed for it by Julius Caesar. Sent to Asia without troops he brought about peace using the troops of his allies there. On his return the Populares impeached him for extorting an ally but the case was dropped. At the outbreak of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)]] both parties put their differences aside until victory was achieved and the Italians were restored to Roman rule.  Sulla, leading troops recruited at Rome itself, had acquired “the name of a great commander,” but the aging Marius accomplished nothing of note.

Wasting no time, Marius subverted one of the [[Tribune|Tribuni plebis]], “Tribunes of the People,”  [[Publius Sulpicius Rufus]],  a feared politician with a private army of 3000 men, to pass an ordinance giving conduct of the war to Marius. Sulpicius had changed allegiance from the ''optimates'' to the ''populares'' to qualify for the magistracy. As blandishment, Marius promised the relief of Sulpicius’ ruinous debt.  Declaring a preventative cessation of business,  the two consuls were attacked by Sulpicius’ men in assembly. Rufus escaped somehow. His son was killed. Marius offered shelter to Sulla for old time’s sake and in exchange for withdrawal of the cessation.

The tribunes sent to take command of the army at [[Nola]] (near Naples) were stoned to death by it. Sulla had gotten there first. Marius began to murder Sulla’s partisans and confiscate their property. Sulla marched on Rome with six legions. He was met by emissaries from the Senate, who would, they assured him, make things right. Sulla agreed but lied, following the emissaries back to Rome to capture the gate. Halted there by a mob, he set fire to Rome.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Appian paints these violent partisan instances as episodes in the [[Roman civil wars]], defining civil war in the ''Foreward'' of his work of the same name as a sanguinary conflict between factions of the same people, each claiming jurisdiction under the authority of the same government. In their attempt to find a Constitution that would satisfy both the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] and the [[Plebs|Plebeians]] the Romans had created two categories of senior magistrates: the [[Consul]]s and [[Praetors]], and the [[Tribune]]s. With competing duties and of parallel authorities they were expected to cooperate, yielding when superseded. The cooperation vanished in the period of the civil wars. In its place was the ''phonos'', the "slaughter." [[Pliny the Elder]] appears to have supported these historical ideas by terming Sulla's activities the ''bellum civile Sullanum'', "Sullan Civil War." (''Natural History 38.46).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marius fled for his life. Sulla passed a death sentence in absentia (later rescinded). Sulpicius was executed. The elections for 87 were upon them. Rufus had been killed in a mutiny. Knowing he could not win, Sulla did not run. He did control who did win, making it possible for them to perform their duties or preventing them. His choices were [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)]], an optimate (although he disliked Sulla) and [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], a popular. The price for Sulla’s support was that they swear a personal oath to leave Sulla in his command, now as [[Proconsul]]. Cinna broke it immediately, suborning a low-level tribune to trump up an accusation (not known what) on the basis of which he began impeachment proceedings against Sulla.

=====The paradox of the ships=====
Over a year had passed since the hapless Romans in Asia had sent urgent appeals for assistance. Mithridates had established sovereignty over nearly all of Greece. The Roman government seemed paralyzed by incidents of partisan contention. Meanwhile, Bruttius Sura, a [[Legatus|Legate]] of one Gaius Sentius, Praetor of Macedonia, was conducting small-unit operations quasi-autonomously against the Pontians in [[Boeotia]] with minimal success. Boeotia though anti-Pontian was being compelled to submit. In the autumn of 88 BC Sulla's [[Quaestor]] (chief supply officer), one [[Lucullus]] (undoubtedly the same as Lucius Licinius Lucullus, written about by Plutarch), arrived to order Sura back to Macedonia and to make supply arrangements with Boeotia and the states of central Greece. In the spring of 87, Sulla abandoned the suite of impeachment and the Civil War to strike suddenly across the Adriatic into central Greece with 5 [[Roman legion|legions]] and some cavalry, in very round numbers, about 30,000 men, mainly veterans of the Social War, many no doubt from his prior command.

Implied by the sudden strike story is the paradox of the ships. During the [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87-86 BC)|siege of Athens]], lacking ships to conduct an amphibious assault on Piraeus, Sulla sends Lucullus to Egypt by night in disguised vessels to beg ships from [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]]. Denied and redirected to [[Cyprus]], Lucullus avoids an ambush there and collects a motley fleet from the islands. Meanwhile, Sulla has no ships, it is said. When history last saw Sulla’s five legions they had been sent back to the camp at Nola. Either Sulla acquired ships there and sailed around the south of Italy or they marched overland to [[Brindisi]], the preferred port of embarcation for voyages to Greece. The sources give no clue.

The troops next appear at Athens without ships. How did they cross the [[Adriatic Sea]]? Mommsen says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Theodor | last=Mommsen | author-link=Theodor Mommsen | editor-first=Arthur C. | editor-last=Howland | title=Rome From Earliest Times to 44 B.C. | volume=Volume III | year=1906 | publisher=John D. Morris &amp; Company | series=The History of Nations | page=217 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzosAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:”...in the spring of 87 B.C. he landed in Epirus—but with only thirty thousand men: he was without a single ship and his treasury was empty.”

He could not have landed in [[Epirus]] without a single ship except by extraordinary means not explained by Mommsen. Similarly, the contemporaneous Long says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=George | last=Long | author-link=George Long (scholar)  | title=The Decline of the Roman Republic  | volume=Volume 2 | publisher=Bell and Daldy | year= 1866 | page=281 | location=London | url= https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA281&amp;lpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:”Sulla left Italy in b.c. 87 with five legions and some auxiliary cohorts and cavalry. He would sail from Brundisium and land somewhere on the opposite coast of the continent. It was a long and difficult march to Athens.”

The ships have appeared in this scenario (one cannot sail without them) but the march is unnecessarily laborious. There is no need to disembark at all: one enters the [[Gulf of Corinth]], which is 81 miles long, and no more than a few days later arrives off the shores of Attica and Boeotia. If the ships are allowed, there is no necessity to have any “landing” or any “march” at all.

The current solution implied or expressed by the scholars is that by “ships” the sources mean warships capable of defeating Archelaus’ warships, which would otherwise ram and sink any troop transports. Sulla’s quaestorial organization would have acquired sufficient transports  for the crossing in Italy. They did not sail to Athens with them as the seas were ruled by Archelaus. The only other route is through the [[Gulf of Corinth]]. It requires that either the ships be dragged across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] on an overland route through enemy territory or be left behind in the Gulf.

What the army did do depended on the disposition of the states on the east side of the Gulf and the moot question of supply. Mommsen and Long (and many others) speculate that the troops arrived in Epirus with empty larders, so to speak. On the contrary, as the master of Rome, Sulla would have had no trouble commandeering whatever initial supplies and ships he needed. His was not a poverty-stricken army. Armies on the move, however, require supply lines, which is what the Civil War would deny Sulla. As soon as he had departed his enemies assumed power, and they had no intention of supplying his army. He was on his own.

Appian gives the most detail:&lt;ref&gt;''Mithridatic Wars'', 5.30.&lt;/ref&gt;
:”Sulla ...  now for the first time passed over to Greece with five legions and a few cohorts and troops of horse and straightway called for money, reënforcements and provisions from Ætolia and Thessaly.”

There is no mention of any land campaign. [[Aetolia]] was on the north shore of the Gulf. [[Thessaly]] was far to the north on the east coast of central Greece. This distance is the basis for Mommsen’s land campaign, as though Thessaly required one. Thessaly, however, was still pro-Roman.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Sulla'', 11.3.&lt;/ref&gt; One does not devastate the country of an ally to acquire supplies. Apparently, Sulla  landed in Aetolia to receive the assistance promised by both states to Lucullus the previous year.

=====The quaestor's road auction=====
Supplied and augmented by Aetolians Sulla’s force marched through the adjoining country of [[Boeotia]]. As a symbol of Roman presence it was immensely successful. Every city of Boeotia, including the recalcitrant [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], rallied to the Roman cause. His flank now covered, Sulla entered [[Megaris]], which had thrown in its lot with Boeotia. It was an important land link between Attica and the Gulf of Corinth. It had a fortified port, [[Aigosthena]], on the [[Alkyonides Gulf]]. Arriving in the vicinity of Athens, Sulla constructed a larger [[castra]] (base) at [[Eleusis]] to support siege operations, supply {{nowrap|operations,&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Roman accounting was more precise than was believed before the excavations at [[Vindolanda]] uncovered the [[Vindolanda tablets]], records written in [[Roman cursive]] on thin wooden leaves, including accounting records. The quaestorium was a well-organized warehouse.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and winter quarters for the men should that become necessary (it did).

After constructing their castra — a Roman legion was prepared to throw up one of those in a single late afternoon, although a permanent camp may have taken longer — the Romans moved to the [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87–86 BC)|siege of Athens]] on the north side. If Sulla had faced the full weight of the Athenian army as it had been, he would perhaps simply have been cleared out of Attica. As it was, Aristion and his Mithridatic ally, Archelaus, were to demonstrate an astounding incompetence (the sources were astounded) against Roman veteran troops; nevertheless, they put up a strong resistance, Archelaus most of all.

The Athenians had created two fortified defensive communities: the city itself with the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the Marketplace (''[[agora]]''), and the port, [[Piraeus]], with a defensible elevation. The path between them was protected by two parallel “[[Long Walls]].” Thinking them unimportant, the defenders allowed these walls to be taken and demolished, thus splitting their forces in two. Archelaus defending Piraeus could be resupplied and reinforced by sea. Aristion in Athens itself could not. Sulla threw the entire weight of his attack against Aristion.

The defenders did have a defense strategy, plotted between Mithridates and Archelaus, who were in relatively rapid communication by swift vessel. Mithridates dispatched a strike force of 120,000 men under his son, [[Arcathias]] (or Ariathes). He took Macedonia and Thessaly but the force was delayed by the natural death of the son. Had he succeeded in reaching Attica in a timely manner Sulla would have been pinned between three forces. This remedy offers some explanation for Aristion’s strange behavior: he sang and danced on the walls of Athens, mocking Sulla by recalling his early career as an entertainer. One source proposes that he was just a fool who liked to entertain the men of his command. Another informs us that he was trying to anger Sulla to keep him on the attack, which also would be a strange thing to do if he did not expect a relieving force. He succeeded all too well, but the timing went wrong.

Sulla sent for some siege engines from Thebes. It was at this time that he crossed paths unkowingly with Aristotle and also made the originally honest decisions that would lead to the plundering of Greek ''objects d’art''. A mere agreement with the allies to provide supplies in kind was grossly insufficient. Cash was needed to pay the men and to buy the goods and services needed for the siege, such as thousands of working mules, drivers and wagons. Just after he was assigned the Mithridatic War, the Senate voted to:&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''Mithridatic War'', 4.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

:”sell the treasures that King [[Numa Pompilius]] had set apart for his sacrifices to the gods.”

That money was gone and Sulla was cut off from Rome, but there were plenty of temples in Greece, each of which served as a repository of wealth. He and Lucullus made the decision to tax these temples for their valuable objects. Letters of appropriation were sent forthwith, delivered by revenue agents in wagons and ships.

The sources concentrate on the three most famous temples:  the Temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]], the [[Asclepeion]] at [[Epidaurus]], and the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia]], which latter yielded “a vast fortune” according to [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;37.7.&lt;/ref&gt; These were not the only temples taxed; there is evidence that the tax might have been on all temples. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions the removal of the statue of Athena from a temple in [[Aliartos|Haliartus]], Boeotia.&lt;ref&gt;9.33.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Sulla was still arguing national security as a motive. After the war he compensated at least some of the temples by giving them confiscated farmland for a yearly income.

Sulla was primarily interested in currency. He could obtain it either by resale of the art objects or by melting them and issuing coin. We are told he founded a mint in the Peloponnesus and that he issued gold and silver coins of greater than standard weight for “purchasing the services of their soldiers with lavish sums.”&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Sulla'', chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  This money was subsequently called “Lucullian,” according to Plutarch.&lt;ref&gt;''Lucullus'', Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The coin discoveries from the region are consistent with this view, although not conclusive. A gold [[aureus]] and a silver [[denarius]] believed from the times are overweight and bear an image of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], Sulla’s patron goddess, on one side with a double cornucopia and the letter Q for Quaestor on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Marvin | last=Tameanko | title=Lucullus, a Second Best Hero Of The Roman Republic | journal=The Journal of Ancient Numismatics | volume=3 | number=1 | year=2009 | url= http://coinproject.com/jan/volume1/issue3/volume1-3-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minting was not the only disposition of the antiques; Sulla was aware of the high resale value of such objects. He took many objects not of precious metal, such as the antique shields of the Greeks who had stopped [[Brennus (3rd century BC)]] at Thermopylae. These must have been sold to the highest bidder.

=== Recensions of ''Physics'' in the ancient Greek ===
A [[recension]] is a selection of a specific text for publication. The manuscripts on a given work attributed to Aristotle offer textual variants. One recension makes a selection of one continuous text, but typically gives notes stating the alternative sections of text. Determining which text is to be presented as "original" is a detailed scholarly investigation. The recension is often known by its scholar's name.

=== Classical and medieval commentaries on the ''Physics'' ===
A [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] differs from a [[Note (typography)|note]] in being a distinct work analyzing the language and subsumed concepts of some other work classically notable. A note appears within the annotated work on the same page or in a separate list. Commentaries are typically arranged by lemmas, or quotes from the notable work, followed by an analysis of the author of the commentary.

The commentaries on every work of Aristotle are a vast and mainly unpublished topic. They extend continuously from the death of the philosopher, representing the entire history of Graeco-Roman philosophy. There are thousands of commentators and commentaries known wholly or more typically in fragments of manuscripts. The latter especially occupy the vaults of institutions formerly responsible for copying them, such as monasteries. The process of publishing them is slow and ongoing.

Below is a brief representative bibliography of published commentaries on Aristotle's ''Physics'' available on or through the Internet. Like the topic itself, they are perforce multi-cultural, but English has been favored, as well as the original languages, ancient Greek and Latin.

It is the actualization (the becoming visible) of a new instance of a form (or system of forms) in matter that has a potency (capability to receive) for it. Brague makes the attempt to elucidate to moderns.

[[File:Principia philosophiae.tif|thumb|''Principia Philosophiæ'', 1685]]
[[File:Descartes Principles of Philosophy 1.png|thumb|right|The illustration of movement of objects from the ''Principles'']]
'''''Principles of Philosophy''''' ({{lang-la|Principia Philosophiæ}}) is a book by [[René Descartes]]. In essence it is a synthesis of the ''[[Discourse on Method]]'' and ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''&lt;ref name="Durandin"&gt;Guy Durandin, Les Principes de la Philosophie. Introduction et notes, Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, Paris, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written in [[Latin]], published in 1644 and dedicated to [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]], with whom Descartes had a long-standing friendship. A French version (''Les Principes de la Philosophie'') followed in 1647. It set forth the principles of nature—the [[Laws of Physics]]—as Descartes viewed them. Most notably, it set forth the principle that in the absence of external forces, an object's motion will be uniform and in a straight line. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] borrowed this principle from Descartes and included it in his own ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''; to this day, it is still generally referred to as [[Newton's First Law of Motion]].&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Whiteside, ''The prehistory of the Principia'' Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 45, 13 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The book was primarily intended to replace the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] curriculum then used in French and British universities. The work provides a systematic statement of his [[metaphysics]] and [[natural philosophy]], and represents the first truly comprehensive, [[mechanics|mechanistic]] account of the universe.

==Preface to the French edition==
Descartes asked Abbot Claude Picot to translate his Latin ''Principia Philosophiæ'' into French. For this edition he wrote a preface, disguised as a letter to the translator, whose title is "''Letter of the author to the translator of the book, that may be used as a preface''". This was published in 1647, a date already in the maturity final period of his life. In this writing Descartes pours some reflexions about his idea of wisdom and philosophy. Its content may be summarized as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm| title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface|  author=René Descartes| others=John Veitch (trans.)| accessdate=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concept of philosophy'''. Philosophy is the study of ''wisdom'', understood as the ability to conduct the human activities; and also as the perfect knowledge of all the things that a man can know for the direction of his life, maintenance of his health, and knowledge of the arts. Only God is perfectly wise, and the man is more or less wise, in proportion to the knowledge he has of the most important truths.

'''The degrees of knowledge'''. Descartes identifies four degrees of knowledge, he names ''common'', and a fifth one he designates as ''higher''. The first degree consists on clear and evident notions that can be acquired without need of any meditation. The second degree is all that is learned by means of the senses. The third comprises what we learn when talking with other men. The fourth consists on what we can learn from the writings of men capable of giving good instructions.

'''Higher wisdom'''. There have been great men in all times that have sought after a better and more secure wisdom, a ''fifth degree'' of knowledge. This has consisted on the search for the ''first causes'', and those that have followed this pursuit have been named ''philosophers'', but he thinks that no one has been successful yet.

'''Doubt and certainty'''. Since Plato and Aristotle there has been a discussion about doubt and certainty. Those that have favored doubt have arrived to extremes of doubting even the most evident things, and those that have sought certainty have relied excessively on senses. Though it is true that it has been accepted that the senses may mislead us, according to Descartes nobody had yet expressed that the truth can not be based on the senses, but in the ''understanding'', when it is founded on ''evident perceptions''.

'''Meditations on first philosophy'''. The search for the first causes, or basic truths, as undertaken by Descartes is contained in this work. It explains the [[metaphysics|metaphysical principles]] on which to build the rest of knowledge.

'''The tree of philosophy'''. The philosophy is like a tree, whose roots are the ''metaphysics'', its trunk the ''physics'', and the branches the rest of sciences, mainly ''medicine'', ''mechanics'', and ''morals'' that is the last level of wisdom. In the same way that the tree has its fruits in its outer parts, the usefulness of philosophy is also contained in the parts that are learnt at the end.

The '''Registry of Research Data Repositories''' ('''re3data.org''') is an [[Open Science]] tool that offers researchers, funding organizations, libraries and publishers an overview of existing international [[data library|repositories]] for [[research data]].

== Background ==

re3data.org is a global registry of research data repositories from all academic disciplines. It provides an overview of existing research data repositories in order to help researchers to identify a suitable repository for their data and thus comply with requirements set out in data policies.&lt;ref name=Pampel2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pampel|first=Heinz|author2=Vierkant, Paul |author3=Scholze, Frank |author4=Bertelmann, Roland |author5=Kindling, Maxi |title=Making Research Data Repositories Visible: The re3data.org Registry|journal=PLoS ONE|date=4 November 2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e78080|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0078080|pmid=24223762|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078080|accessdate=7 February 2014|bibcode=2013PLoSO...878080P|pmc=3817176|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The registry was officially launched in May 2013.&lt;ref name=Wellander2013&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sparceurope.org/registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched-re3data-org/ | title=Registry of Research Data Repositories launched – re3data.org | author=Wellander, Janna | date= 4 June 2013 | work=SPARC Europe | accessdate= 5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

In March 2014 the registry lists 634 research data repositories from around the world covering all academic disciplines. 586 of these are described in detail using the re3data.org schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=re3data.org – from Funding to Growing|url=http://www.re3data.org/2014/03/re3data-org-from-funding-to-growing/|work=re3data.org|accessdate=21 March 2014|date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project makes all metadata in the registry available for open use under the Creative Commons deed CC0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DataCite, re3data.org, and Databib Announce Collaboration|url=http://www.re3data.org/2014/03/datacite-re3data-org-databib-collaboration/|work=re3data|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DRYAD entry in re3data.org 2014-03-21.png|thumb|A screenshot of the DataDryad entry in re3data.org.]]

== Features ==

The majority of the listed research data repositories are described in detail by a comprehensive schema, namely the re3data.org Schema for the Description of Research Data Repositories.&lt;ref name=Vierkant&gt;{{cite web|last=Vierkant|first=Paul|title=Schema for the description of research data repositories|work=GFZ Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam|accessdate=7 February 2014|author2=Spier, Shaked |author3=Rücknagel, Jessika |author4= et. al. |url=http://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/faces/viewItemFullPage.jsp?itemId=escidoc:301641|doi=10.2312/re3.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information icons support researchers to identify an adequate repository for the storage and reuse of their data.&lt;ref name=Wellander2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fenner|first=Martin|title=registry of research data repositories launched|url=http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2013/06/01/re3data-org-registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched/|work=PLOS Blog|publisher=Gobbledygook|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Journal.pone.0078080.g001.png|thumb|Aspects of a Research Data Repository with the corresponding icons used in re3data.org.]]

== Inclusion criteria ==

A repository is indexed when the minimum requirements for inclusion in re3data.org are met: the repository has to be run by a legal entity, such as a sustainable institution (e.g. library, university) and clearly state access conditions to the data and repository as well as the terms of use. Additionally, an English [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) plus a focus on research [[data]] is needed.&lt;ref name=Vierkant /&gt;

== Partners and Cooperation ==

re3data.org is a joint project of the [[Berlin School of Library and Information Science]], the [[GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]] and the Library of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT). The project is funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (DFG).&lt;ref name=Pampel2013 /&gt;
The project cooperates with other Open Science initiatives like Databib,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kratz|first=John|title=Finding Disciplinary Data Repositories with DataBib and re3data|url=http://datapub.cdlib.org/2014/03/03/finding-disciplinary-data-repositories-with-databib-and-re3data/|work=Data Pub|accessdate=21 March 2014|author2=Nicholls, Natsuko |date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BioSharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases|url=http://www.biosharing.org/biodbcore|work=biosharing|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DataCite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources|url=http://www.datacite.org/resources|work=DataCite|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095924/http://www.datacite.org/resources|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OpenAIRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=re3data.org and OpenAIRE sign Memorandum of Understanding|url=https://www.openaire.eu/it/component/content/article/481-re3data-and-openaire-sign-memorandum-of-understanding|work=OpenAIRE|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several publishers, research institutions and funders refer to re3data.org in their Editorial Policies and guidelines as a tool for the identification of suitable data repositories, e.g. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The paper trail|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-paper-trail-1.13123|work=Nature|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SpringerPlus - Editorial policies|url=http://www.springerplus.com/about#editorialpolicies|work=SpringerPlus|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data in Horizon 2020|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal College of Science for Ireland''' ('''RCScI'''&lt;ref name="ucdrcsci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/merrionstreet/rcsci.html|title=The Royal College of Science for Ireland|year=2011|work=Merrion Street|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an institute for [[higher education]] in Dublin which existed from 1867 to 1926, specialising in [[physical sciences]] and [[applied science]]. It was originally based on [[St. Stephen's Green]],  moving in 1911 to [[Government Buildings|a purpose-built "Royal College of Science" building]] on [[Merrion Street]]. In 1926 it was absorbed into [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) as the [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] of Science and Engineering.

==Foundation==
The Museum of Economic Geology was founded by the [[Dublin Castle administration]] in 1845, with chemist [[Robert Kane (chemist)|Robert Kane]] as curator, and a focus on [[mining in Ireland]] similar to the [[Geological Museum|Museum of Practical Geology]] in London.&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380225 p.ix]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/exhibition-details-outofstorage.aspx?article=5be165bf-d84b-4c9a-a83f-4473c71bea70|title=The Museum of Irish Industry|work=Permanent Exhibitions &gt; Out of Storage|publisher=[[National Museum of Ireland]]|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216193808/http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/exhibition-details-outofstorage.aspx?article=5be165bf-d84b-4c9a-a83f-4473c71bea70|archivedate=16 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Kane was promoted to director, expanding its remit, and renaming it the [[Museum of Irish Industry]] (MII).&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"/&gt; In 1853 a new [[Science and Art Department]] was created within [[Government of the United Kingdom|the Whitehall administration]], and in 1854 the MII placed under its remit.&lt;ref name="sc1864p14"&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380230 p.xiv]&lt;/ref&gt; A School of Science applied to Mining and the Arts was created, modelled on the [[Royal School of Mines]] in London, with four professorships shared jointly by the MII school and the [[Royal Dublin Society]] (RDS).&lt;ref name="sc1864p14"/&gt; The MII and School shared premises at 51, St. Stephen's Green, acquired in 1846 and fitted out by 1852.&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"/&gt; In 1864, a [[select committee]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] recommended that the MII and School be entirely separated from the RDS and broadened into a government-supported College of Science for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380239 p.xxiii §§5–8]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[HM Treasury]] agreed and in 1867 a commission was appointed by the education committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The commission, headed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]], outlined the scope and functions of the proposed college, and the RCScI mission statement on 11 September 1867 was:&lt;ref name="ucdarch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/archives/html/university/rcsi.htm|title=Royal College of Science in Ireland|work=Archives|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:The object of the Royal College of Science is to supply as far as practicable a Complete Course of instruction in Science applicable to the Industrial Arts, especially those which may be classed broadly under the heads of Mining, Agriculture, Engineering, and Manufactures, and to aid in the instruction of Teachers for the local Schools of Science

[[George Sigerson]] complained in 1868 that the RCScI was less open to Catholics than the MII had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Ireland: Its Vital Questions, Secret Societies, and Government |url=https://archive.org/details/modernirelandit00sigegoog |chapterurl=http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/ModIrelandRoyalCollege/index.php |year=1868 |publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer |location=London |pages=197–207 |chapter=The Royal College of Science for Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development==
The RCScI's remit was later changed to exclude include agriculture and include "Physics and Natural Science".&lt;ref name="ucdarch"/&gt;  The number of students enrolled increased gradually.&lt;ref name="ivrla30371"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ucd.ie/view/ivrla:30371|title=RCSI numbers of attendence &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|date=1 December 2009|work=UCD Digital Library|publisher=UCD|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1898 the RCScI had chairs of Mining and Mineralogy, Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Botany, Geology, Applied Mathematics and Mechanism, Descriptive Geometry and Engineering.&lt;ref name="ucdarch"/&gt; In 1900, control was transferred from the Science and Art Department in London to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Dublin, headed by [[Horace Plunkett]].&lt;ref name="ucdrcsci"/&gt; A new building was proposed in 1897 and a site from [[Merrion Street]] to [[Kildare Street]] was chosen in 1898; in 1899 the plan was extended to include government administrative offices as well as the new college.&lt;ref name="ucdnewbldg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/merrionstreet/newbuilding.html|title=The New Building|year=2011|work=Merrion Street|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building was designed by Sir [[Aston Webb]]; the [[foundation stone]] was laid in 1904 by [[Edward VII]] and it was opened in 1911 by [[George V]].&lt;ref name="ucdnewbldg"/&gt;

In 1926 the RCScI was absorbed into UCD where it became the UCD Science and Engineering faculties. Science moved to [[National Concert Hall|UCD's Earlsfort Terrace building]], and on to [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]]  in the 1960s; Engineering moved from Merrion Street to Belfield in 1989. The RCScI building was then absorbed into [[Government Buildings]] with the rest of Aston Webb's complex, lavishly renovated by [[Charles Haughey]] and used to house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/History_of_Government_Buildings/|title=History of Government Buildings: 1904-1922 and 1990|publisher=Department of the Taoiseach|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Grant Award''' was a grant award originally announced in 2000.&lt;ref name="torygraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1350497/4m-set-aside-to-lure-Beckhams-of-science.html "£4m set aside to lure 'Beckhams of science'"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', July 27, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; which has now been superseded by the [[Royal Society Wolfson Fellowship]]s. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/wolfson-research-merit/|title=Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 26 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

It was administered by the [[Royal Society]] and jointly funded by the [[Wolfson Foundation]] and the UK [[Office of Science and Technology]], to give universities additional financial support to attract key researchers to this country or to retain those who might seek to gain higher salaries elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/6MdvAoJ6d&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle the [[brain drain]].&lt;ref name="braindrain"/&gt; They were given in four annual rounds, with up to seven awards per round.&lt;ref name="braindrain"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smaglik | first1 = P. | title = Battling the brain drain | doi = 10.1038/nj6871-03a | journal = Nature | volume = 415 | issue = 6871 | pages = 3–31 | year = 2002 | pmid =  11823808| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; Science 2.0 benefits from openness and sharing, regarding papers and research ideas and partial solutions.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt;

A general view is that Science 2.0 is gaining traction&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; with websites beginning to proliferate,&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; yet at the same time there is considerable resistance within the scientific community about aspects of the transition as well as discussion about what, exactly, the term means. There are several views that there is a "sea change" happening in the [[status quo]] of scientific publishing,&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; and substantive change regarding how scientists share research data.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; There is considerable discussion in the scientific community about whether scientists should embrace the model and exactly how Science 2.0 might work, as well as several reports that many scientists are slow to embrace collaborative methods&lt;ref name=tws2E23/&gt; and are somewhat "inhibited and slow to adopt a lot of online tools."&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt;

The term has many meanings and continues to evolve in scientific parlance. It not only describes what is currently happening in science, but describes a direction in which proponents believe science should move towards, as well as a growing number of websites which promote free scientific collaboration.

[[File:Ben Shneiderman at UNCC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ben Shneiderman]]]]
The term ''Science 2.0'' suggests a contrast between traditional ways of doing science, often denoted ''Science 1.0'', with more collaborative approaches, and suggests that the new forms of science will work with [[Web 2.0]] technologies.&lt;ref name=tws2E1112/&gt; One description from ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' is that Science 2.0 uses the "networking power of the internet to tackle problems with multiple interacting variables - the problems, in other words, of everyday life."&lt;ref name=tws2E34/&gt; A different and somewhat controversial view is that of [[Ben Shneiderman]], who suggested that Science 2.0 combines hypothesis-based inquiries with social science methods, partially for the purpose of improving those new networks.&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt;

While the term describes websites for sharing scientific knowledge, it also includes efforts by existing science publishers to embrace new digital tools, such as offering areas for discussions following published online articles.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Sometimes it denotes [[open access]] which, according to one view, means that the author continues to hold the copyright but that others can read it and use it for reasonable purposes, provided that the attribution is maintained.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Most online scientific literature is behind [[paywall]]s, meaning that a person can find the title of an article on Google but they can not read the actual article.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; People who can access these articles are generally affiliated with a university&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; or secondary school or library or other educational institution, or who pay on a per-article or subscription basis.

{{Quote|Traditional scientific journals are part of this social evolution too, innovating ways to engage scientists online and enable global collaboration and conversation. Even the 187-year-old Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences has joined the digital age. The Academy now permits free public access to selected online content and has digitized every volume dating back to 1823.|Adrienne J. Burke in ''Seed Magazine'', 2012&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt;}}

One view is that ''Science 2.0'' should include an effort by scientists to offer papers in non-technical language, as a way of reaching out to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=tws2E28&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2012-06-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For others, it includes building vast databases of case histories.&lt;ref name=tws2E34/&gt; There is a sense in which ''Science 2.0'' indicates a general direction for scientific collaboration, although there is little clarity about how exactly this might happen. One aim is to "make scientific collaboration as easy as sharing videos of trips home from the dentist," according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E23/&gt;

Closely related terms are "cyberscience" focussing on scientists communicating in the cyberspace&lt;ref&gt;First used by P. Wouters (1996). Cyberscience. Kennis en Methode, 20(2), 155-186, elaborated in: Nentwich, M. (2003) Cyberscience. Research in the Age of Digital Networks. Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences Press [http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/3188-7], {{ISBN|978-3-7001-3188-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "cyberscience 2.0" expanding the notion to the emerging trend of academics using Web 2.0 tools.&lt;ref&gt;Nentwich, M. and König, R.

==History and background==
The rise of the [[Internet]] has transformed many activities such as [[retailing]] and information searching.&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; In [[journalism]], Internet technologies such as [[blogging]], tagging and [[social networking]] have caused many existing media sources such as newspapers to "adopt whole new ways of thinking and operating," according to a report in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2E41&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that while the Internet has transformed many aspects of life, it has not changed scientific research as much as it could. While firms such as eBay, Amazon and Netflix have changed consumer retailing, and online patient-centered medical data has enabled better health care, Science 2.0 advocate Ben Shneiderman said:

{{Quote|It's time for researchers in science to take network collaboration like this to the next phase and reap the potential intellectual and societal payoffs.|Ben Shneiderman, 2008&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt;}}

According to one view, a similar web-inspired transformation that has happened to other areas is now happening to science.&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; The general view is that science has been slower than other areas to embrace the web technology, but that it is beginning to catch up.&lt;ref name=tws2E42&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was done in private. Next, it was submitted to scientific publications and reviewed by editors and gatekeepers and other scientists. Last, it was published.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; This has been the traditional pathway of scientific advancement, sometimes dubbed ''Science 1.0''.

Established journals provided a "critical service", according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Publications such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' have large editorial staffs to manage the peer-review process as well as have hired fact-checkers and screeners to look over submissions. These publications get revenue from subscriptions, including online ones, as well as advertising revenue and fees paid by authors.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; According to advocates of Science 2.0, however, this process of paper-submission and review was rather long.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Detractors complained that the system is "hidebound, expensive and elitist", sometimes "reductionist",&lt;ref name=tws2E1112/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt; as well as being slow and "prohibitively costly".&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Only a select group of gatekeepers—those in charge of the traditional publications—limited the flow of information.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Proponents of [[open science]] claimed that scientists could learn more and learn faster if there is a "friction-free collaboration over the Internet."&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt;

Yet there is considerable resistance within the scientific community to a change of approach. The act of publishing a new finding in a major journal has been at the "heart of the career of scientists," according to one view, which elaborated that many scientists would be reluctant to sacrifice the "emotional reward" of having their discoveries published in the usual, traditional way.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Established scientists are often loath to switch to an open-source model, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt;

Timo Hannay explained that the traditional publish-a-paper model, sometimes described as "Science 1.0",&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt; was a workable one but there need to be other ways for scientists to make contributions and get credit for their work:

{{Quote|The unit of contribution to the scientific knowledge base has become the paper. Journals grew up as a means for scientists to be able to share their discoveries and ideas. The incentive for doing so was that by publishing in journals their contributions would be recognized by citation and other means. So you have this pact: be open with your ideas and share them through journals and you will get credit... There are all kinds of ways in which scientists can contribute to the global endeavor. ... The incentive structure has not caught up with what we really want scientists to do.|Timo Hannay, 2012&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt;}}

There are reports that established journals are moving towards greater openness. Some help readers network online; others enable commenters to post links to websites; others make papers accessible after a certain period of time has elapsed.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; But it remains a "hotly debated question", according to one view, whether the business of scientific research can move away from the model of "peer-vetted, high-quality content without requiring payment for access."&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; The topic has been discussed in a lecture series at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=tws2E1113&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponent Adam Bly thinks that the key elements needed to transform Science 2.0 are "vision" and "infrastructure":

{{Quote|Open science is not this maverick idea; it’s becoming reality. About 35 percent of scientists are using things like blogs to consume and produce content. There is an explosion of online tools and platforms available to scientists, ranging from Web 2.0 tools modified or created for the scientific world to Web sites that are doing amazing things with video, lab notebooks, and social networking. There are thousands of scientific software programs freely available online and tens of millions of science, technology, and math journal articles online. What’s missing is the vision and infrastructure to bring together all of the various changes and new players across this Science 2.0 landscape so that it’s simple, scalable, and sustainable—so that it makes research better.|[[Adam Bly]], 2012&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">The '''Scientific temper''' is a way of life (defined in this context as an individual and social process of thinking and acting) which uses the [[scientific method]] and which may, consequently, include questioning, [[observation|observing]] [[physical body|physical]] [[reality]], [[experiment|testing]], [[hypothesis|hypothesizing]], analysing, and communicating (not necessarily in that order). "Scientific temper" describes an attitude which involves the application of [[logic]]. Discussion, argument and analysis are vital parts of scientific temper. Elements of fairness, equality and democracy are built into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/seta/2005/09/22/stories/2005092200211700.htm|title=Scientific temper and the argumentative Indian |publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2007-09-25|location=Chennai, India|date=2005-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was the first to use the phrase in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahanti|first1=Subodh|title=A Perspective on Scientific Temper in India|journal=Journal of Scientific Temper|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–62|url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/JST/article/view/1099}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later gave a descriptive explanation:
{{quote|"[What is needed] is the scientific approach, the adventurous and yet critical temper of science, the search for [[truth]] and new [[knowledge]], the refusal to accept anything without testing and trial, the capacity to change previous conclusions in the face of new evidence, the reliance on observed fact and not on pre-conceived [[theory]], the hard discipline of the mind—all this is necessary, not merely for the application of science but for life itself and the solution of its many problems."&amp;nbsp;—[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (1946) ''[[The Discovery of India]]'', p. 512}}

Nehru wrote that the scientific temper goes beyond the domains to which science is conventionally understood to be limited to, and deals also with the consideration of ultimate purposes, [[aesthetics|beauty]], goodness and truth. Nehru also contended that the scientific temper is the opposite of the method of religion, which relies on emotion and intuition and is (mis)applied "to everything in life, even to those things which are capable of intellectual inquiry and observation." While religion tends to close the mind and produce "[[Social tolerance|intolerance]], [[credulity]] and [[superstition]], emotionalism and irrationalism", and "a temper of a dependent, unfree person", a scientific temper "is the temper of a [[freedom|free]] man". He also indicated that the scientific temper goes beyond [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and fosters creativity and progress. He envisioned that the spread of scientific temper would be accompanied by a shrinking of the domain of [[religion]], and "the exciting adventure of fresh and never ceasing discoveries, of new panoramas opening out and new ways of living, adding to [life's] fullness and ever making it richer and more complete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jawaharlal |last=1Nehru |title=The Discovery of India |edition= Centenary |publisher=Oxford: University Press |year=1989 |page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nehru states (that) "It is science alone that can solve the problems of [[malnutrition|hunger]] and [[poverty in India|poverty]], of insanitation and [[literacy in India|illiteracy]], of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kar|first1=Devi|title=THE NEED TO FOSTER A SCIENTIFIC TEMPER|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120821/jsp/opinion/story_15874879.jsp#.VJeYScFcBg|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis and development of the idea of the scientific temper is connected to ideas expressed earlier by [[Charles Darwin]] when he said, "[F]reedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=Darwin Correspondence Project|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/entry-12757|work=Darwin, C. R. to Aveling, E. B. 13 Oct 1880|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Karl Marx]] when he said, "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions."

"To develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform" is one of the [[Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India|fundamental duties]] of the people of the [[Republic of India]], according to the [[Constitution of India]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite book| title = Introduction to the Constitution of India| last = Basu| first = Durga Das| year = 1993| edition = 15th| place = New Delhi| publisher = [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall of India]]| isbn = 81-203-0839-5| page = 131| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of India]], through the National Council for Science and Technology Communication, dedicated the 28 February [[National Science Day]] of 2014 to the theme "Fostering Scientific Temper" to spread Nehru's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keshavamurthy|first1=H.R.|title=Fostering Scientific Temper is Fundamental to Innovation and Progress|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx?relid=104309|publisher=Press Information Bureau, India|accessdate=22 December 2014|date=27 February 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources]] launched the scholarly serial ''Journal of Scientific Temper'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Journal of Scientific Temper''|url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/JST/index|publisher=NISCAIR, India|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serendipity''' means an unplanned, fortunate  discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serendipity|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/serendipity|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford dictionary|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of serendipity is a common occurrence throughout the history of scientific innovation. Examples are [[Alexander Fleming]]'s accidental discovery of [[penicillin]] in 1928, the invention of the [[microwave oven]] by Percy Spencer  in 1945, and the invention of the [[Post-it note]] by [[Spencer Silver]] in 1968.

In June 2004, a British translation company voted the word to be one of the ten English [[words hardest to translate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Words hardest to translate – The list by Today Translations. Also defined in modern times as "An unexpected discovery occurring by design". Unknown reference updated on 12/14/2014 by Isaac Lucero, Santa Fe, NM USA |publisher=Global Oneness |date=21 April 2009 |url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Words_hardest_to_translate_-_The_list_by_Today_Translations/id/5596801 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125055716/http://experiencefestival.com/a/Words_hardest_to_translate_-_The_list_by_Today_Translations/id/5596801 |archivedate=January 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to its sociological use, the word has since been exported into many other languages.&lt;ref&gt;For example: [[portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''serendipicidade'' or ''serendipidade''; French ''sérendipicité'' or ''sérendipité'' but also ''heureux hasard'', "fortunate chance"; Italian ''serendipità'' ([http://dizionari.hoepli.it/Dizionario_Italiano/parola/serendipita.aspx?idD=1&amp;Query=serendipit%C3%A0&amp;lettera=S Italian Dictionary Hoepli, cfr.]); [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''serendipiteit''; German ''Serendipität''; Japanese serendipiti (セレンディピティ); [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''serendipitet''; [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''serendipitate''; Spanish ''serendipia'', Polish: ''Serendypność''; [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''serendipiteetti''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first noted use of "serendipity" in the [[English language]] was by [[Horace Walpole]] in 1754. In a letter he wrote to his friend [[Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet|Horace Mann]], Walpole explained an unexpected discovery he had made about a (lost) painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-04|title=Lost artworks|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lost_artworks&amp;oldid=798895435|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Bianca Cappello]] by [[Giorgio Vasari]] by reference to a  Persian fairy tale, ''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]''. The princes, he told his correspondent, were "always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Theodore G. |editor-last=Remer |title=Serendipity and the Three Princes, from the Peregrinaggio of 1557 |page=6|others=Edited, with an Introduction and Notes, by Theodore G. Remer. Preface by W. S. Lewis |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=1965 }} LCC 65-10112&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from ''[[Names of Sri Lanka#Ceylon, Serendip and related names|Serendip]]'', an old name for [[Sri Lanka]] (Ceylon), hence ''Sarandib'' by Arab traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Robert K. Merton, Elinor|title=The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity : A Study in Sociological Semantics and the Sociology of Science|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691126305|pages=1–3|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Sanskrit ''Siṃhaladvīpaḥ'' (Siṃhalaḥ, Sri Lanka + dvīpaḥ, island).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/serendipity|title=serendipity|author=|date=|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and strategy==
M. E. Graebner describes serendipitous value in the context of the acquisition of a business as "windfalls that were not anticipated by the buyer prior to the deal": i.e., unexpected advantages or benefits incurred due to positive synergy effects of the merger.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[Ikujiro Nonaka]]&lt;ref&gt;1991, p.&amp;nbsp;94 November–December issue of [[Harvard Business Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; points out that the serendipitous quality of innovation is highly recognized by managers and links the success of Japanese enterprises to their ability to create knowledge not by processing information but rather by "tapping the tacit and often highly subjective insights, intuitions, and hunches of individual employees and making those insights available for testing and use by the company as a whole".

Serendipity is postulated by Napier and Vuong (2013) as a 'strategic advantage' with which a firm can tap its potential creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdjYAQAAQBAJ Napier, Nancy K., and Vuong Quan Hoang. "Serendipity as a strategic advantage?." ''Strategic Management in the 21st Century; edited by Timothy J. Wilkinson.'', '''2013''', ''1'', 175–199.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serendipity is a key concept in [[competitive intelligence]] because it is one of the tools for avoiding blind spots (see [[Blindspots analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egideria.com/serendip.html Serendipity in Competitive Intelligence by [[Yves-Michel Marti]], Egideria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827142133/http://www.egideria.com/serendip.html |date=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2013}}

==Uses==
Serendipity is used as a [[sociology|sociological]] method in [[Anselm L. Strauss]]' and [[Barney G. Glaser]]'s ''[[grounded theory]]'', building on ideas by sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]], who in ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'' (1949) referred to the "serendipity pattern" as the fairly common experience of observing an unanticipated, anomalous and strategic datum which becomes the occasion for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory. Merton also co-authored (with Elinor Barber) ''The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity'',&lt;ref&gt;Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the origins and uses of the word "serendipity" since it was coined. The book is "a study in sociological semantics and the sociology of science", as the subtitle of the book declares. It further develops the idea of serendipity as scientific "method" (as juxtaposed with purposeful discovery by experiment or retrospective prophecy).

=={{anchor|Zemblanity|Bahramdipity}}Related terms==
[[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] coined the term '''zemblanity''' in the late twentieth century to mean somewhat the opposite of serendipity: "making unhappy, unlucky and unexpected discoveries occurring by design".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, William. ''Armadillo'', Chapter 12, [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], New York, 1998. {{ISBN|0-375-40223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A zemblanity is, effectively, an "unpleasant unsurprise". It derives from [[Novaya Zemlya]] (or Nova Zembla), a cold, barren land with many features opposite to the lush Sri Lanka (Serendip). On this island [[Willem Barents]] and his crew were stranded while searching for a new route to the east.

'''Bahramdipity''' is derived directly from [[Bahram V|Bahram Gur]] as characterized in ''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]''.  It describes the ''suppression'' of serendipitous discoveries or research results by powerful individuals.&lt;ref&gt;(a) [http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1999/feb/opin_990201.html Sommer, Toby J. "'Bahramdipity' and Scientific Research", ''The Scientist'', '''1999''', ''13''(3), 13.] &lt;br /&gt;(b) [http://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/Sommer.pdf Sommer, Toby J.

'''The Science Network (TSN)''' is a non-profit virtual forum dedicated to science and its impact on society. Initially conceived in 2003 by [[Roger Bingham]] and [[Terry Sejnowski]] as a cable science network,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/12/61423?currentPage=1 Wired: Are You Ready for Some Science?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/11/candle-in-the-dark/ Michael Shermer.com, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; TSN would soon become a global digital platform. TSN currently offers free access to over 1100 videos&lt;ref name="search" /&gt; of lectures from scientific meetings and long form one-on-one conversations with prominent scientists and communicators of science, including [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[V.S. Ramachandran]], [[Helen S. Mayberg]], and [[Barbara Landau]], on topics including education, aging, neuroscience, and stem cells.&lt;ref name="search"&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/search?q=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 TSN Search]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its mission, TSN has also sponsored and co-sponsored scientific forums, such as the landmark Symposium and Town Hall meeting, ''Stem cells: science, ethics and politics at the crossroads'', held at the Salk Institute in 2004 &lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/stem-cells-science-ethics-and-politics-at-the-crossroads Stem Cells: Science, Ethics and Politics at the Crossroads]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salk.edu/insidesalk/pdf/InsideSalkNov04.pdf Inside Salk 11 04]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Beyond Belief'' conference series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programgroup/beyond-belief ''Beyond Belief'' conference series]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Beyond Belief'' Conference Series==

TSN's signature series ''Beyond Belief'' was conceived to bring together a community of scientists, philosophers, scholars from the humanities, and social commentators. Speakers at these meetings have included [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Harry Kroto]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], and [[Stuart Kauffman]]. So far, the following three ''Beyond Belief'' conferences were organized:

===2006: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival===
''[[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]]'',  the first of The Science Network's annual Beyond Belief symposia, held from November 5 to November 7, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival ''Beyond Belief: Science, Reason, Religion &amp; Survival'']&lt;/ref&gt; was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "a free-for-all on science and religion," which seemed at times like "the founding convention for a political party built on a single plank: in a world dangerously charged with ideology, science needs to take on an evangelical role, vying with religion as teller of the greatest story ever told." According to participant [[Melvin Konner]], however, the event came to resemble a "den of vipers” debating the issue, "Should we bash religion with a crowbar or only with a baseball bat?”&lt;ref name = "nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/science/21belief.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/T/Tyson,%20Neil%20DeGrasse&amp;_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all ''A Free-for-All on Science and Religion," George Johnson, New York Times, Section F, Page 1, November 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Scientist]] summed up the topics to be discussed as a list of three questions:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225780.142-beyond-belief-in-place-of-god.html Michael Brooks and Helen Phillips, New Scientist, November 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Can [[science]] help us create a new rational narrative as poetic and powerful as those that have traditionally sustained societies?
* Can we treat [[religion]] as a natural phenomenon?
* Can we be good without [[God]]? And if not God, then what?

Speakers included physicists [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], biologist [[Joan Roughgarden]], and astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]].&lt;ref name = "nyt"/&gt;

===2007: Enlightenment 2.0===
''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'' was the second annual symposium and was held from 31 October to 2 November 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-enlightenment-2-0 ''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'']&lt;/ref&gt;  at the Frederic de Hoffmann Auditorium of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

===2008: Candles in the Dark===
''Beyond Belief: Candles in the Dark'' was the third annual Beyond Belief symposium. This event was organized by The Science Network and held from 3 October to 6 October 2008 in La Jolla, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-candles-in-the-dark|title=2008 Official Website|work=The Science Network|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''[[Undergraduate research|Undergraduate Research]] Opportunities Program''' provides funding and/or credit to [[undergraduate]] students who volunteer for faculty-mentored research projects pertaining to all academic disciplines at universities such as [[The University of Queensland]], [[Boston University]], the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Georgia Tech), the [[University of California, Irvine]], [[California State University Long Beach|California State University, Long Beach]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of Michigan-Flint]], [[Florida State University]], the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] (HKUST), the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]], the [[RWTH Aachen University]], [[Imperial College London]], the [[University of New Hampshire]], the [[Nanyang Technological University]] and the [[University of Oregon]].

The MIT program was founded in 1969, and the program at the [[University of Michigan]] was founded in the 1989 (primarily to help [[minorities]] and women break into science and mathematics). The University of California, Irvine founded its program in 1995. In the United Kingdom, [[Imperial College London]] provides a program for doing research in most of its departments for undergraduates at Imperial. Furthermore, the UROP scheme is also available at the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Reading]], the [[University of Essex]] and the [[National University of Singapore]]. In 2008 the [[RWTH Aachen]] University started the first international UROP program for students from the United States and Canada in Germany. The [[University of Sussex]] runs a similar scheme, across all of its departments, where undergraduates are funded for 6 weeks as Junior Research Associates. The California State University, Long Beach program does not serve transfer students.

Students can apply for funding by submitting a proposal during "Calls for Proposals", which occur throughout the school year.

The Calls are announced on the school web sites and distributed to faculty members and the undergraduate counseling offices. Students have approximately one month from the announcement to submit their proposals. All undergraduate students from all disciplines and majors who are participating in a research project with a faculty advisor (usually a full-time professor at the university) eligible to respond to the current Call for Proposals if they are in good academic standing with the school.

Proposals are prepared by the student applicant and jointly submitted by the student and the faculty advisors. UROP funds a variety of projects with grants depending upon the merits of the project. At [[UC Irvine]], an individual student may receive up to $1,000 through UROP for projects during the school year, to help pay for supplies and other necessary materials. Alternatively, [[UC Irvine]] students may also apply for a prestigious summer [[Fellow|fellowship]], by which they may be awarded as much as $3,000 per project, which is meant to reward them for their time and efforts. Higher amounts may be awarded for group projects. The UROP Faculty Advisory Board reviews proposals and decides whether the project merits funding. The UROP Faculty Advisory Board also makes the funding recommendations.

Upon completion of the year-long research project, students are expected to present their findings at the school's research symposium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/news/urop-symposium-features-student-research-projects|title=UROP Symposium features student research projects|work=The Michigan Daily|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although not a requirement, some students may submit their written reports (ranging from 15-25 pages) to the faculty committee in order to be considered for publication in the university's research journals. Publication in the UROP undergraduate research journal is known to be extremely competitive. In many cases, students are asked to submit numerous drafts to the faculty committee for review, only to find out that their papers are later denied publication. In the past, a mere 5% of all submissions were accepted for publication in the [[UC Irvine]] and [[MIT]] journals.

In addition, the [[University of Michigan]] housing also offers a UROP in residence option, called the [[Michigan Research Community]], or MRC. This is an option for UROP students to live with each other and get an in-depth education in the [[University of Michigan|University of Michigan's]] research. Additionally, students can also apply for a summer scholarship fellowship, in which students are given up to $3,000 to fund their own project.
