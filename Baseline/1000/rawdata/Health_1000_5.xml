      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8903">'''Adolescent health''', or youth health, is the range of approaches to preventing, detecting or treating young people’s health and well being &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/adolescent-health-recommendations/en/ WHO 2017, recommendations on adolescent health: guidelines approved by the WHO Review, Geneva: World Health Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The term [[adolescence|adolescent]] and [[youth|young people]] are often used interchangeably, as are the terms Adolescent Health and Youth Health. Young people's health is often complex and requires a comprehensive, biopsychosocial approach.

==Key adolescent health risks==
Some young people engage in risky behaviours that affect their health and therefore the majority of health problems are psychosocial. Many young people experience multiple problems. These behaviours are established as a young person and go on to become the lifestyles of adults leading to chronic health problems. Social, cultural and environmental factors are all important.
Young people have specific health problems and developmental needs that differ from those of children or adults: The causes of ill-health in adolescents are mostly [[psychosocial]] rather than [[biological]]. Young people often engage in health risk behaviours that reflect the processes of [[adolescent development]]: experimentation and exploration, including using [[drugs]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]], and other risk taking that affect their physical and [[mental health]]. Adolescent health also encompasses children's and young people's sexual and reproductive health (SRH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Health Organisation describes the leading health related problems in the age group 10 – 19 years to include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs345/en/ WHO 2017, Adolescents: health risks and solutions. Fact sheet, Updated May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Early [[pregnancy]] and childbirth
*[[HIV]]
*Other [[infectious diseases]]
*[[Mental health]] problems including [[Clinical depression|depression]] and [[suicide]]
*[[Violence]] 
*[[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]] and other drugs
*[[Injuries]] both unintentional and [[self-injury]] 
*[[Sexual health]] / [[Infectious diseases]]
*[[Malnutrition]] and [[obesity]]
*[[Exercise]] and [[Nutrition]]  
*[[Tobacco use]]
*[[Rights]] of adolescents
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Young people]] often lack awareness of the harm associated with risk behaviours, and the skills to protect themselves as well as the lack knowledge about how and where to seek help for their health concerns &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080127131706/http://www.caah.chw.edu.au/resources/#03 Chown P, Kang M, Sanci L, Newnham V and Bennett D 2008, Adolescent Health: enhancing the skills of General Practitioners in caring for young people from culturally diverse backgrounds, NSW Centre for the Advancement of Adolescent Health and Transcultural Mental Health Centre.]&lt;/ref&gt;. By intervening at this early life stage, many chronic conditions later in life can be prevented.

==Key principles in adolescent health==
[[Evidence-based]] practices include [[harm reduction]] and [[health promotion]] to intervene early in the life course and illness trajectory. Youth health is founded on [[collaborative]] approaches that address [[social justice]]. [[Youth development]] approaches include [[youth empowerment]] and [[youth participation]]. Their aim is to promote [[youth rights]], [[youth voice]] and [[youth engagement]].

== Access to quality health-care services for adolescents==
Studies about young people's access to healthcare have identified major barriers including concerns about confidentiality, practitioners attitudes and communication style, environment, availability of services, cost and the developmental characteristics of young people. Marginalised young people can have greater difficulty accessing health services&lt;ref&gt;Robards F, Kang M, Usherwood T, Sanci L, How marginalized young people access, engage with, and navigate health-care systems in the digital age: Systematic review Journal of Adolescent Health, First online Feb 2018, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2017.10.018].&lt;/ref&gt; and need support to navigate the health system.&lt;ref&gt;Robards F, Kang M, Tolley K, Hawke C, Sanci L, Usherwood T, Marginalised young people’s healthcare journeys: Professionals’ perspectives, Health Education Journal, First online Feb 2018, [https://doi.org/10.1177/0017896917752965].&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organisation 'Global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents' include: &lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/183935/1/9789241549332_vol1_eng.pdf?ua=1 WHO 2015, Global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents: a guide to implement a standards-driven approach to improve the quality of health care services for adolescents. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adolescents’ health literacy 
* Community support 
* Appropriate package of services 
* Providers’ competencies 
* Facility characteristics 
* Equity and non-discrimination 
* Standard Data and quality improvement 
* Adolescents’ participation

==Key health services for young people==
Youth Health includes [[adolescent medicine]] as a speciality, along with other primary and tertiary care services. Health services for young people include [[mental health]] services, [[child protection]], drug and alcohol services, [[sexual health]] services. [[General Practitioners]] work alongside multidisciplinary health practitioners including [[psychology]], [[social Work]] and Youth health [[nursing]] and [[school health services]]. [[Youth work]] and [[youth development]] services support and engage young people. Web based supports, such as [[Reach Out!]], provide early intervention.

Youth health services ('one-stop-shops' for young people) are specialist services providing multi-disciplinary, [[primary health care]] to young people. Focusing on engaging disadvantaged young people, they deliver flexible and unique services to young people in relaxed and comfortable youth-friendly environments. Youth health services work in partnership with other government and non-government services. Youth health services provide a range of entry-points and non-threatening services (such as creative arts, basic services such as showers and laundries, a drop in service, sports and recreational facilities), which encourage young people to connect with the service on their own terms. They also provide informal links to other support services and sectors including [[education]], [[housing]], [[financial support]] and [[legal services]], offering support to young people who are dealing with complex issues. Youth health services understand the need to respond immediately to young people’s requests for support and assistance and they share a common operating philosophy, which values [[social justice]], [[Equity (economics)|equity]], and a [[holistic]] view of young people’s health and well being.

[[Capacity building]] organisations support the Youth Health sector by providing access to information and resources, conducting research and providing training.

:''See also: [[Electronic health record#United States]]''

The move to [[electronic medical record]]s (EMRs) is becoming increasingly prevalent in health care delivery systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Garets&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Patient Records: EMRs and EHRs |url=http://www.providersedge.com/ehdocs/ehr_articles/Electronic_Patient_Records-EMRs_and_EHRs.pdf |work=Healthcare Informatics Online |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies |author1=Dave Garets |author2=Mike Davis |date=October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714033442/http://www.providersedge.com/ehdocs/ehr_articles/Electronic_Patient_Records-EMRs_and_EHRs.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Due to the enactment of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], there has been a rise in the number of federal investments in programs that increase EMR adoption.&lt;ref name=Desroches&gt;{{cite web|title=Small, Nonteaching, And Rural Hospitals Continue To Be Slow In Adopting Electronic Health Record Systems|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2012/04/19/hlthaff.2012.0153.abstract|work=Health Affairs|author1=Catherine M. DesRoches |author2=Chantal Worzala |author3=Maulik S. Joshi |author4=Peter D. Kralovec |author5=Ashish K. Jha |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0153|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] portion of this stimulus law provides payments for providers that show they have reached the standard for “meaningful use”.&lt;ref name="Desroches" /&gt; This has led more hospitals to adopt EMR, though they have had different experiences in adopting electronic medical records.

There are several steps that need to be taken in order to adopt electronic medical records. 
# A supportive environment, adequate training and resources, a clear direction, and engaged people are a few things needed.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Change Management Strategies for an Effective EMR Implementation|url=http://www.himss.org/content/files/CHANGEMANAGEMENT.pdf|work=HIMSS|author1=Claire McCarthy |author2=Douglas Eastman |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# A strong leader is also necessary in order to facilitate the changing environment and using meetings and announcements as adoption promotion tactics have been shown to be useful.&lt;ref name="Silo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Electronic Health Records to Improve Quality and Efficiency: The Experiences of Leading Hospitals|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Issue%20Brief/2012/Jul/1608_SilowCarroll_using_EHRs_improve_quality.pdf|work=The Commonwealth Fund|author1=Sharon Silow-Carroll |author2=Jennifer N. Edwards |author3=Diana Rodin |date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Having the clinical staff involved is also a key feature in successfully adopting electronic medical records. Many hospitals use “physician champions,” who are essentially physicians who educate their peers on the benefits of electronic medical records.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; 
# Furthermore, the importance of quality department leaders has been stressed in order to make sure the electronic medical records system is beneficial in providing quality care.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt;
Hospitals have been using different suppliers of health data systems in order to adopt electronic medical records. The key suppliers of health data systems are [[Epic Systems]], [[Allscripts]], [[Meditech]], [[Cerner]], [[IBM]], McKesson, [[Siemens]], [[Healthland]], [[CPSI]], and [[GE Healthcare]].&lt;ref name="Freudenheim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digitizing Health Records, Before It Was Cool|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/business/epic-systems-digitizing-health-records-before-it-was-cool.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;|work=The New York Times|author =Milt Freudenheim|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of choosing an EMR [[vendor]] like Epic or Meditech can fall on either hospital leadership or the corporate level based on the size of the system.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; If an organization only has one hospital, the hospital leaders select the vendor. If the system is larger, the decision is made at the corporate level, though several people from the hospitals remain involved.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; There are several criteria for deciding the vendor. [[Sentara Healthcare]] was able to make their selection by looking for a vendor with high outpatient care integration, technical support at all levels of integration, and one that customized a system to their needs.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt;

The length of time it takes to implement electronic medical records can vary but usually takes two to three years.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; The first stage of implementation is called “design, build, validate,” where the vendor is selected and the plans are put in place. This is followed by a “big bang” implementation, which means all the departments transfer to the system at once, due to the interconnectedness of hospitals this is necessary.

Though the adoption of electronic medical records is increasing, there is a range in the level of implementation. The [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society|HIMSS]] Analytics Database shows the eight stages of adoption in their [[United States]] EMR Adoption Model. Stage 0 implies “All three ancillaries not installed,” while in Stage 7 there is a shift to complete EMR. The EMR Adoption Model shows that in 2011, the number of acute care hospitals achieving Stage 5 or Stage 6 increased by more than 80 percent.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt; Meanwhile, the number of hospitals at Stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 has decreased. Furthermore, adoption has increased most among large hospitals and those in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Desroches" /&gt;{{clarify|reason=This part about stages had poor context. It needs to be re-written|date=September 2015}}

== Implementation ==
EMR implementation experiences among hospitals and healthcare delivery systems vary. Some systems have successful experiences, while others do not have as seamless of a transition. For example, in 2002, [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, CA]] attempted to implement a new EMR system, but the US$34 million system failed due to numerous factors. The physicians were unhappy because of the new physician order entry system for [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]], [[Medical laboratory|labs]] and procedures was more time consuming than doing the orders by hand. Physicians often found themselves spending extra time to avoid the system's warnings because there was not room for flexibility within the EMR system.&lt;ref name=Kumar&gt;{{cite web|title=Overcoming barriers to electronic medical record (EMR) implementation in the US healthcare system: A comparative study|url=http://jhi.sagepub.com/content/16/4/306.full.pdf+html|work=Health Informatics Journal|author1=Sameer Kumar |author2=Krista Aldrich |doi=10.1177/1460458210380523|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was the new system more time consuming, but it also alerted physicians with numerous electronic reminders and alerts that the physicians felt were excessive. The system was implemented with numerous decision support mechanisms, which created alerts that could not be overridden by physicians.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; This flaw was a result of not obtaining adequate physician input for the EMR system and not enough prior testing.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; These problems then made it very difficult to obtain buy-in from the physicians, which ultimately caused several hundred physicians employed at Cedars to refuse to use the system after only 3 months.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smelcer&gt;{{cite web|title=Usability of Electronic Medical Records|url=http://www.upassoc.org/upa_publications/jus/2009february/smelcer4.html|work=Journal of Usability Studies|author1=John B. Smelcer |author2=Hal Miller-Jacobs |author3=Lyle Kantrovich |date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure was not only due to technology design and inefficiencies, but also to poor training and implementation. The hospital had implemented the system with very little prior testing, and did not gradually phase in the system but rather implemented it all at once.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; There was also not full buy-in from the staff at all levels of the organization, and insufficient training to ensure that the staff was ready for implementation.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The example of failed EMR implementation at Cedars shows the complexities that health systems face in EMR implementation. However, there are numerous positive EMR experiences as well.

Both [[Geisinger Health System]] and [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]] have been cited as having successful implementations of EMR systems.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; Both of these systems utilized key strategies that ultimately led to successful implementation.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; To create success, both Geisinger and NY Presbyterian utilized clinical teams to develop the EMR system, and therefore gained staff and physician buy-in.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; Another strategy used to reach successful implementation is for the organization to focus on training. At Geisinger, for example, the hospital provided “shadowers” for physicians and nurses throughout the day during the implementation phase.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; Then, as physicians and nurses gradually become proficient with the new system, the number of trainers needed gradually decreased. Both hospitals also clearly emphasized that training was mandatory for all staff and that all staff must pass a proficiency test before they can access the EMR system.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; Another strategy for successful EMR implementation used by these two hospitals is to use the EMR system for performance improvement through standardized care protocols. To successfully do this, NY Presbyterian gradually utilized more hard stops{{clarify|date=September 2015}} within their protocols over time to ensure that protocols were being followed. However, these hard stops were created collaboratively to achieve physician buy-in and ensure that they were appropriate for care delivery. Allowing tailoring of the EMR system is essential to both before implementation and afterwards, and physicians and clinical staff must be used in this development process to create success.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt;

==Results==
Currently, there has been little research and evaluation on the post-implementation of commercial electronic medical records (EMR). MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, OH, has published an evaluation of the EpicCare EMR by Epic Systems five years after implementation. MetroHealth’s methods included a web-based survey for primary care providers to measure their level of utilization of the EpicCare EMR. The physicians surveyed were those in the internal medicine, family medicine, and the pediatric units of the hospital. Prior to the survey, physicians were given eight hours of training by consultants on how to navigate the EMR system. The survey subsequently taken showed a response rate of 35% or 59 of 154 providers. Questions included whether providers have a computer at home, whether they access EpicCare from home, and their level of expertise on using a computer. The results showed that 97% had a computer at home, while 53% accessed EpicCare from home, and 11% were computer novice, 76% intermediate, and 13% were advance users. {{clarify|text=Using a scale of 1 to 4, 87% of providers surveyed rated the EpicCare system as either good or excellent.|reason=how are "good" and "excellent" between "1" and "4"?|date=September 2015}} &lt;ref name=Kaelber&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of a Commercial Electronic Medical Record (EMR) by Primary Care Physicians 5 Years after Implementation|author1=David Kaelber |author2=Peter Greco |author3=Randall D Cebul |year=2005|pmc=1560716|volume=2005|pages=1002|journal=AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings|pmid=16779289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey showed that in terms of the overall level of satisfaction with the EMR, 6% of respondents felt that EpicCare was inferior to a paper-based system, 81% felt that it was superior, while 13% were indifferent. In the area of training, 46% of respondents felt that their training was inadequate, and 75% would like to receive additional training. The implementation of the EpicCare EMR has impacted the way physicians treated their patients as evidenced by 12% of respondents reporting that they had changed medications based on the medication alerts and 15% reporting that they followed the EMR’s best practices alerts. The survey results revealed several areas that can benefit from improvement, such as ongoing training and support as well as the optimal utilization of all EMR functions.&lt;ref name="Kaelber" /&gt;

JKL Healthcare System, a nonprofit organization that employs a 450-employee physician group and operates three acute care hospitals, implemented an EMR system in 2001. The cost of "Epic", the new system, was $35 million. Their goal is for every physician in their organization to adapt the EMR at a 100% utilization rate in order to increase efficiency and reduce adverse patient outcomes. 450 physicians were required to attend a 16-hour training session in order to obtain a certification that would allow them to admit patients. 1,700 Non-physician employees were required to attend the same training to receive their certification as well.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementation of the EPIC Electronic Medical Record/Physician Order- Entry System|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/695253/implementation_of_the_epic_electronic_medical_recordphysician_order_entry_system/|work=Journal of Healthcare Management|publisher=Health Administration Press|author =Mary S. O'Brien|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A physician survey was conducted two months after implementation which showed that out of 73 respondents, 90% of physicians felt that the Epic system made their jobs easier and more efficient. Admissions for the hospitals have risen since implementation as well as physician support, which indicated that the EMR has been implemented successfully. During the May – August 2004 period of post implementation, outpatient visits increased by 3%, medication errors were eliminated completely, and patient satisfaction surveys showed that overall satisfaction increased to their highest level since 2000. EMR utilization has saved JKL Healthcare approximately $50,000 on office supplies and has significantly reduced the number of medical records staff.&lt;ref name="O'Brien" /&gt;

The JKL Healthcare System was one of the first successful implementers of EMR using the Epic System, and they became a model site for other healthcare systems. JKL Healthcare received the Davies Award in September 2004, which is the most prestigious award in the IT industry for its implementation of the most comprehensive EMR system in the US.&lt;ref name="O'Brien" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Altitude sickness''', the mildest form being '''acute mountain sickness''' ('''AMS'''), is the negative health [[effects of high altitude on humans|effect of high altitude]], caused by rapid exposure to low [[Breathing gas#Partial pressure of oxygen|amounts of oxygen]] at [[high altitude|high elevation]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro&gt;{{cite web |title=Altitude Diseases - Injuries; Poisoning |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/injuries-poisoning/altitude-diseases/altitude-diseases |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |accessdate=3 August 2018 |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms may include [[headache|headaches]], vomiting, tiredness, trouble sleeping, and [[dizziness]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Acute mountain sickness can progress to [[high altitude pulmonary edema]] (HAPE) with associated [[shortness of breath]] or [[high altitude cerebral edema]] (HACE) with associated confusion.&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt; [[Chronic mountain sickness]] may occur after long term exposure to high altitude.&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Altitude sickness typically only occurs above {{convert|2500|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, though some are affected at lower altitudes.&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sim2018/&gt; Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness, a high degree of activity, and a rapid increase in elevation.&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt; Diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities.&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinical Examination Systematic Review 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=D|last2=Collet|first2=TH|last3=Locatelli|first3=I|last4=Cornuz|first4=J|last5=Kayser|first5=B|last6=Simel|first6=DL|last7=Sartori|first7=C|title=Does This Patient Have Acute Mountain Sickness?: The Rational Clinical Examination Systematic Review.|journal=JAMA|date=14 November 2017|volume=318|issue=18|pages=1810–1819|doi=10.1001/jama.2017.16192|pmid=29136449}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended that at high-altitude any symptoms of headache, nausea, shortness of breath, or vomiting be assumed to be altitude sickness.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | title=A Comprehensive Guide to Wilderness &amp; Travel Medicine - 3rd edition | last=Weiss | first=Eric | date=2005 | isbn=0-9659768-1-5 | chapter=Altitude Illness | pages=137-141 | quote=The Golden Rules of Altitude Illness 1) Above 8,000 feet, headache, nausea, shortness of breath, and vomiting should be considered to be altitude illness until proven otherwise. 2) No one with mild symptoms of altitude illness should ascend any higher until symptoms have resolved. 3) Anyone with worsening symptoms or severe symptoms of altitude illness should descend immediately to a lower altitude. }} &lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention is by gradually increasing elevation by no more than {{convert|300|m|ft|sigfig=1}} per day.&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Being physically fit does not decrease the risk.&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt; Treatment is generally by descending to a lower altitude and sufficient fluids.&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt; Mild cases may be helped by [[ibuprofen]], [[acetazolamide]], or [[dexamethasone]].&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt; Severe cases may benefit from [[oxygen therapy]] and a [[portable hyperbaric bag]] may be used if descent is not possible.&lt;ref name=Fer2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferri |first1=Fred F. |title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017 E-Book: 5 Books in 1 |date=2016 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323448383 |page=590 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA590 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment efforts, however, have not been well studied.&lt;ref name=Sim2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simancas-Racines |first1=D |last2=Arevalo-Rodriguez |first2=I |last3=Osorio |first3=D |last4=Franco |first4=JV |last5=Xu |first5=Y |last6=Hidalgo |first6=R |title=Interventions for treating acute high altitude illness. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=30 June 2018 |volume=6 |pages=CD009567 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009567.pub2 |pmid=29959871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
AMS occurs in about 20% of people after rapidly going to {{convert|2500|m|ft|sigfig=1}} and 40% of people going to {{convert|3000|m|ft|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro/&gt; While AMS and HACE occurs equally frequently in males and females, HAPE occurs more often in males.&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; The earliest description of altitude sickness is attributed to a Chinese text from around 30 BCE which describes "Big Headache Mountains" possibly referring to the [[Karakoram Mountains]] around [[Kilik Pass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=John B. |title=High Life: A History of High-Altitude Physiology and Medicine |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781461475736 |pages=2–7 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=o0rhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Peripheral edema of a woman's face, before and after; Annapurna Base Camp, 2015.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Right: A woman with a swollen face while trekking at high altitude ([[Annapurna]] Base Camp, Nepal; 4130 m). Left: The same woman at normal altitude.]]
People have different susceptibilities to altitude sickness; for some otherwise healthy people, acute altitude sickness can begin to appear at around {{convert|2000|m}} above sea level, such as at many mountain ski resorts, equivalent to a pressure of {{convert|80|kPa|atm|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author1=K. Baillie |author2=A. Simpson | title=Acute mountain sickness| url=http://www.altitude.org/high_altitude.php | publisher=Apex (Altitude Physiology Expeditions) | accessdate=8 August 2007}}&amp;nbsp;— High altitude information for laypeople&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most frequent type of altitude sickness encountered. Symptoms often manifest themselves six to ten hours after ascent and generally subside in one to two days, but they occasionally develop into the more serious conditions. Symptoms include headache, fatigue, stomach illness, dizziness, and sleep disturbance.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{Cite web | author = A. A. R. Thompson | title = Altitude Sickness | url = http://www.altitude.org/altitude_sickness.php | publisher = Apex | accessdate = 8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exertion aggravates the symptoms.

Those individuals with the lowest initial partial pressure of end-tidal pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the lowest concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] at the end of the respiratory cycle, a measure of a higher alveolar ventilation) and corresponding high oxygen saturation levels tend to have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness than those with high end-tidal pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and low oxygen saturation levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglas|first=Danielle|author2=Robert Schoene|title=End-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and acute mountain sickness in the first 24 hours upon ascent to cusco, peru (3326 meters)|journal=Wilderness and Environment Medicine|year=2010|volume=21|pages=109–113|doi=10.1016/j.wem.2010.01.003|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary symptoms===
[[Headache]]s are the primary symptom used to diagnose altitude sickness, although a headache is also a symptom of [[dehydration]]. A headache occurring at an altitude above {{convert|2400|m}}{{snd}}a pressure of {{convert|76|kPa|atm}}{{snd}}combined with any one or more of the following symptoms, may indicate altitude sickness:

===Severe symptoms===
Symptoms that may indicate life-threatening altitude sickness include:
; [[Pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the lungs)
: Symptoms similar to [[bronchitis]]
: Persistent dry cough
: Fever
: Shortness of breath even when resting

; [[Cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain):
: Headache that does not respond to analgesics
: Unsteady gait
: Gradual loss of consciousness
: Increased nausea and vomiting
: Retinal hemorrhage

The most serious symptoms of altitude sickness arise from [[edema]] (fluid accumulation in the tissues of the body). At very high altitude, humans can get either [[high altitude pulmonary edema]] (HAPE), or [[high altitude cerebral edema]] (HACE). The physiological cause of altitude-induced edema is not conclusively established. It is currently believed, however, that HACE is caused by local vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels in response to [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], resulting in greater blood flow and, consequently, greater capillary pressures. On the other hand, HAPE may be due to general vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation (normally a response to regional ventilation-perfusion mismatches) which, with constant or increased cardiac output, also leads to increases in capillary pressures. For those suffering HACE, [[dexamethasone]] may provide temporary relief from symptoms in order to keep descending under their own power.

HAPE can progress rapidly and is often fatal. Symptoms include fatigue, severe [[dyspnea]] at rest, and cough that is initially dry but may progress to produce pink, frothy [[sputum]]. Descent to lower altitudes alleviates the symptoms of HAPE.

HACE is a life-threatening condition that can lead to coma or death. Symptoms include headache, fatigue, visual impairment, bladder dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, loss of coordination, paralysis on one side of the body, and confusion. Descent to lower altitudes may save those afflicted with HACE.

Altitude sickness can first occur at 1,500 metres, with the effects becoming severe at extreme altitudes (greater than 5,500 metres). Only brief trips above 6,000 metres are possible and supplemental oxygen is needed to avert sickness.

As altitude increases, the available amount of oxygen to sustain mental and physical alertness decreases with the overall air pressure, though the relative percentage of oxygen in air, at about 21%, remains practically unchanged up to {{convert|21,000|m|-4}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = FSF Editorial Staff | url = http://flightsafety.org/hf/hf_may-jun97.pdf | title = Wheel-well Stowaways Risk Lethal Levels of Hypoxia and Hypothermia | journal = Human Factors and Aviation Medicine | page = 2 | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | date = May–June 1997 | publisher = Flight Safety Foundation | accessdate = 28 October 2010 | quote = The relative amount of oxygen in the air (21 percent) does not vary appreciably at altitudes up to 21,350 meters (70,000 feet). | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101128161251/http://flightsafety.org/hf/hf_may-jun97.pdf| archivedate= 28 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Root mean square speed|RMS velocities]] of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen are very similar and thus no change occurs in the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen until stratospheric heights.

[[Dehydration]] due to the higher rate of water vapor lost from the lungs at higher altitudes may contribute to the symptoms of altitude sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0028-4793| volume = 345| issue = 2| pages = 107–114| last = Hackett| first = P H|author2=R C Roach| title = High-altitude illness| journal = The New England Journal of Medicine| date = 12 July 2001| doi = 10.1056/NEJM200107123450206| pmid = 11450659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of ascent, altitude attained, amount of physical activity at high altitude, as well as individual susceptibility, are contributing factors to the onset and severity of high-altitude illness.

Altitude sickness usually occurs following a rapid ascent and can usually be prevented by ascending slowly.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; In most of these cases, the symptoms are temporary and usually abate as altitude acclimatization occurs. However, in extreme cases, altitude sickness can be fatal.

=== High altitude ===
At high altitude, {{convert|1500|to|3500|m|ft}}, the onset of physiological effects of diminished inspiratory oxygen pressure (PiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) includes decreased exercise performance and increased ventilation (lower arterial [[partial pressure of carbon dioxide]]: PCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). While arterial oxygen transport may be only slightly impaired the [[Oxygen saturation (medicine)|arterial oxygen saturation]] (SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generally stays above 90%. Altitude sickness is common between 2,400 and 4,000&amp;nbsp;m because of the large number of people who ascend rapidly to these altitudes.&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2007"&gt;{{cite book  |last=Auerbach |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Auerbach |title=Wilderness Medicine |publisher=Mosby Elsevier |edition=5th |year=2007 |isbn=0-323-03228-1 |ref=Auer07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Very high altitude ===
At very high altitude, {{convert|3500|to|5500|m|ft}}, maximum SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; falls below 90% as the arterial PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; falls below 60mmHg. Extreme [[hypoxemia]] may occur during exercise, during sleep, and in the presence of high altitude pulmonary edema or other acute lung conditions. Severe altitude illness occurs most commonly in this range.&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2007"/&gt;

=== Extreme altitude ===
Above {{convert|5500|m|ft}}, marked hypoxemia, [[hypocapnia]], and alkalosis are characteristic of extreme altitudes. Progressive deterioration of physiologic function eventually outstrips acclimatization. As a result, no permanent human habitation occurs above {{convert|6000|m}}. A period of acclimatization is necessary when ascending to extreme altitude; abrupt ascent without supplemental oxygen for other than brief exposures invites severe altitude sickness.&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2007"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
The [[Breathing#Air pressure|physiology of altitude sickness]] centres around the [[alveolar gas equation]]; the atmospheric pressure is low, but there is still 20.9% Oxygen, water vapour still occupies the same pressure too, this means that there is less oxygen pressure available in the lungs and blood. Compare these two equations comparing the amount of oxygen in blood at altitude:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=James PR|last2=Grocott|first2=Michael PW|date=2013-02-01|title=Humans at altitude: physiology and pathophysiology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjaed/article/13/1/17/281180/Humans-at-altitude-physiology-and-pathophysiology|journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care &amp; Pain|volume=13|issue=1|pages=17–22|doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mks047|issn=1743-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
The hypoxia leads to an increase in minute ventilation (hence both low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and subsequently bicarbonate), Hb increases through haemoconcentration and erythrogenesis. Alkylosis shifts the haemaglobin dissociation constant to the left, 2,3-DPG increases to counter this. Cardiac output increases through an increase in heart rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The body's response to high altitude includes the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* ↑ Erythropoietin → ↑ hematocrit and hemoglobin
* ↑ [[2,3-BPG]] (allows ↑ release of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a right shift on the Hb-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; disassociation curve)
* ↑ kidney excretion of bicarbonate (use of acetazolamide can augment for treatment)
* Chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (can cause right ventricular hypertrophy)
People with high-altitude sickness generally have reduced hyperventilator response, impaired gas exchange, fluid retention or increased sympathetic drive. There is thought to be an increase in cerebral venous volume because of an increase in cerebral blood flow and hypocapnic cerebral vasoconstriction causing oedema.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis can be assisted with a number of different scoring systems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Examination Systematic Review 2017"/&gt;

==Prevention==
Ascending slowly is the best way to avoid altitude sickness.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; Avoiding strenuous activity such as skiing, hiking, etc. in the first 24 hours at high altitude reduces the symptoms of AMS. Alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants, and thus slow down the acclimatization process and should be avoided. Alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates AMS. Thus, avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24–48 hours at a higher altitude is optimal.

===Pre-acclimatization===
Pre-acclimatization is when the body develops tolerance to low oxygen concentrations before ascending to an altitude. It significantly reduces risk because less time has to be spent at altitude to acclimatize in the traditional way. Additionally, because less time has to be spent on the mountain, less food and supplies have to be taken up. Several commercial systems exist that use [[altitude tent]]s, so called because they mimic altitude by reducing the percentage of oxygen in the air while keeping air pressure constant to the surroundings.

===Altitude acclimatization===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] --&gt;
Altitude acclimatization is the process of adjusting to decreasing [[oxygen]] levels at higher elevations, in order to avoid altitude sickness.&lt;ref name=Acclimatization&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Muza, S.R. |author2=Fulco, C.S. |author3=Cymerman, A. |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide |journal=U.S. Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=USARIEM–TN–04–05 |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=5 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once above approximately {{convert|3000|m|-3}}{{snd}}a pressure of {{convert|70|kPa|atm}}{{snd}}most climbers and high-altitude trekkers take the "climb-high, sleep-low" approach. For high-altitude climbers, a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a [[base camp]], climb up to a higher camp (slowly), and then return to base camp. A subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay. This process is then repeated a few times, each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there, a process that involves the production of additional [[Homeostasis#Blood oxygen content|red blood cells]].&lt;ref name=tortora&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P.| title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |pages=444–445|edition= Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|publication-date= 1987 |isbn= 0-06-350729-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the climber has acclimatized to a given altitude, the process is repeated with camps placed at progressively higher elevations. The rule of thumb is to ascend no more than {{convert|300|m|-2|abbr=on}} per day to sleep. That is, one can climb from {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} ({{convert|70|kPa|atm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to {{convert|4500|m|-3|abbr=on}} ({{convert|58|kPa|atm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in one day, but one should then descend back to {{convert|3300|m|abbr=on}} ({{convert|67.5|kPa|atm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to sleep. This process cannot safely be rushed, and this is why climbers need to spend days (or even weeks at times) acclimatizing before attempting to climb a high peak. Simulated altitude equipment such as [[altitude tent]]s provide hypoxic (reduced oxygen) air, and are designed to allow partial pre-acclimation to high altitude, reducing the total time required on the mountain itself.

Altitude acclimatization is necessary for some people who move rapidly from lower altitudes to intermediate altitudes (e.g., by aircraft and ground transportation over a few hours), such as from sea level to {{convert|8000|ft|m}} as in many Colorado, USA mountain resorts. Stopping at an intermediate altitude overnight (for example, staying overnight when arriving through [[Denver]], at {{convert|5500|ft|m}}, when traveling to the aforementioned Colorado resorts) can alleviate or eliminate occurrences of AMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.altitudemedicine.org/altitude-illness/ |title=Altitude Illness |publisher=Institute for Altitide Medicine  |location=Telluride, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===

This change in pH stimulates the respiratory center to increase the depth and frequency of respiration, thus speeding the natural acclimatization process. An undesirable side-effect of acetazolamide is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance. Other minor side effects include a tingle-sensation in hands and feet.

Prior to the onset of altitude sickness, [[ibuprofen]] is a suggested non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and painkiller that can help alleviate both the headache and nausea associated with AMS. It has not been studied for the prevention of [[cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain) associated with extreme symptoms of AMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2012/march/altitude.html | title= Ibuprofen decreases likelihood of altitude sickness, researchers find | author= John Sanford |date=March 2012 | accessdate= 19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] such as the [[Aymaras]] of the [[Altiplano]], have chewed [[coca]] leaves to try to alleviate the symptoms of mild altitude sickness. In Chinese and Tibetan traditional medicine, an extract of the root tissue of ''[[Rhodiola rosea|Radix rhodiola]]'' is often taken in order to prevent the same symptoms, though neither of these therapies has been proven effective in clinical study.

===Oxygen enrichment===
In high-altitude conditions, oxygen enrichment can counteract the hypoxia related effects of altitude sickness. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At {{convert|3400|m}} ({{convert|67|kPa|atm|abbr=on|disp=or}}), raising the oxygen concentration level by 5% via an [[oxygen concentrator]] and an existing ventilation system provides an effective altitude of {{convert|3000|m|-3|abbr=on}} ({{convert|70|kPa|atm|abbr=on|disp=or}}), which is more tolerable for those unaccustomed to high altitudes.&lt;ref name="pmid7777705"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = West JB | title = Oxygen enrichment of room air to relieve the hypoxia of high altitude | journal = Respiration physiology | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–232 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7777705 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(94)00094-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen from gas bottles or liquid containers can be applied directly via a nasal cannula or mask. Oxygen concentrators based upon [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA), VSA, or vacuum-pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) can be used to generate the oxygen if electricity is available. Stationary oxygen concentrators typically use PSA technology, which has performance degradations at the lower barometric pressures at high altitudes. One way to compensate for the performance degradation is to utilize a concentrator with more flow capacity. There are also portable oxygen concentrators that can be used on vehicular DC power or on internal batteries, and at least one system commercially available measures and compensates for the altitude effect on its performance up to {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}}. The application of high-purity oxygen from one of these methods increases the partial pressure of oxygen by raising the [[FIO2|FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (fraction of inspired oxygen).

===Other methods===
Increased water intake may also help in acclimatization&lt;ref name="dannen"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Dannen | first = Kent | authorlink = | last2=Dannen |first2=Donna | title = Rocky Mountain National Park | publisher = Globe Pequot | year = 2002 | location =  | pages = 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=txzevi145t8C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22drinking+plenty+of+water%22+%22altitude+sickness%22 | isbn = 0-7627-2245-2 | quote = Visitors unaccustomed to high elevations may experience symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)[...s]uggestions for alleviating symptoms include drinking plenty of water[.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the fluids lost through heavier breathing in the thin, dry air found at altitude, although consuming excessive quantities ("over-hydration") has no benefits and may cause dangerous [[hyponatremia]].

== Treatment ==
The only reliable treatment, and in many cases the only option available, is to descend. Attempts to treat or stabilize the patient ''in situ'' (at altitude) are dangerous unless highly controlled and with good medical facilities. However, the following treatments have been used when the patient's location and circumstances permit:
* Oxygen may be used for mild to moderate AMS below {{convert|3700|m|-3}} and is commonly provided by physicians at mountain resorts. Symptoms abate in 12 to 36 hours without the need to descend.
* For more serious cases of AMS, or where rapid descent is impractical, a [[Gamow bag]], a portable plastic [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric chamber]] inflated with a foot pump, can be used to reduce the effective altitude by as much as {{convert|1500|m|-3|abbr=on}}. A Gamow bag is generally used only as an aid to evacuate severe AMS patients, not to treat them at altitude.
* [[Acetazolamide]] 250&amp;nbsp;mg twice daily dosing assists in AMS treatment by quickening altitude acclimatization.&lt;ref name="pmid5916650"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Cain SM, Dunn JE | title = Low doses of acetazolamide to aid accommodation of men to altitude | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 1195–200 |date=July 1966 | pmid = 5916650}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Denali Medical Research Project concluded: "In established cases of acute mountain sickness, treatment with acetazolamide relieves symptoms, improves arterial oxygenation, and prevents further impairment of pulmonary gas exchange."&lt;ref name="pmid1739236"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Grissom CK, Roach RC, Sarnquist FH, Hackett PH | title = Acetazolamide in the treatment of acute mountain sickness: clinical efficacy and effect on gas exchange | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–5 |date=March 1992 | pmid = 1739236 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-116-6-461}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The folk remedy for altitude sickness in [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] is a tea made from the coca plant. See [[Coca tea|mate de coca]].
* [[Steroids]] can be used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary or cerebral edema, but do not treat the underlying AMS.
* Two studies in 2012 showed that Ibuprofen 600 milligrams three times daily was effective at decreasing the severity and incidence of AMS; it was not clear if HAPE or HACE was affected.&lt;ref name="Lipman 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Grant S |last=Lipman |first2=Nicholas C |last2=Kanaan |first3=Peter S |last3=Holck |first4=Benjamin B |last4=Constance |first5=Jeffrey H |last5=Gertsch |title=Ibuprofen prevents altitude illness: a randomized controlled trial for prevention of altitude illness with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |date=June 2012 |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=484–490 |pmid=22440488 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2012.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gertsch 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gertsch |first=Jeffrey H |first2=B |last2=Corbett |first3=Peter S |last3=Holck |first4=A |last4=Mulcahy |first5=M |last5=Watts |title=Altitude Sickness in Climbers and Efficacy of NSAIDs Trial (ASCENT): randomized, controlled trial of ibuprofen versus placebo for prevention of altitude illness |journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine |year=2012 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=307–315 |pmid=23098412 |doi=10.1016/j.wem.2012.08.001|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back labor may be noted when the baby is face up in the birth canal (occiput posterior), and not face down, so that the back of the baby's skull ([[occiput]]) is pushed against the mother's [[sacrum]].

'''Capitation''' is a payment arrangement for [[health care]] service providers such as [[physician]]s, [[physician assistants]] or [[nurse practitioner]]s. It pays a physician or group of physicians a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to them, per period of time, whether or not that person seeks care. These providers generally are [[contract]]ed with a type of [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO) known as an [[independent practice association]] (IPA), which enlists the providers to care for HMO-enrolled [[patient]]s. The amount of remuneration is based on the average expected health care utilization of that patient, with greater payment for patients with significant medical history.

==Types==
Primary capitation is a relationship between a managed care organization (MCO) and primary care physician (PCP), in which the PCP is paid directly by the MCO for those enrolled members who have selected the physician as their provider.&lt;ref&gt;Arrow K, Auerbach A, Bertko J, Brownlee S, Casalino LP, Cooper J, Crosson FJ, Enthoven A, Falcone E, Feldman RC, Fuchs VR, Garber AM, Gold MR, Goldman D, Hadfield GK, Hall MA, Horwitz RI, Hooven M, Jacobson PD, Jost TS, Kotlikoff LJ, Levin J, Levine S, Levy R, Linscott K, Luft HS, Mashal R, McFadden D, Mechanic D, Meltzer D, Newhouse JP, Noll RG, Pietzsch JB, Pizzo P, Reischauer RD, Rosenbaum S, Sage W, Schaeffer LD, Sheen E, Silber BM, Skinner J, Shortell SM, Thier SO, Tunis S, Wulsin L, Yock P, Nun GB, Bryan S, Luxenburg O, van de Ven WP. [[Toward a 21st-century health care system: recommendations for health care reform.]] Ann Intern Med. 2009; 150 (7): 493-5
&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary capitation is a relationship arranged by the MCO between a PCP and a secondary or specialist provider, such as an X-ray facility or ancillary facility such as a durable medical equipment supplier whose secondary provider is also paid capitation based on that PCP’s enrolled membership.

Global capitation is a relationship based on a provider who provides services and is reimbursed per-member per-month (PMPM) for the entire network population.

==Incentives==
Under capitation, physicians are given an incentive to consider the cost of treatment. Pure capitation pays a set fee per patient, regardless of their degree of infirmity, giving physicians an incentive to avoid the most costly patients.&lt;ref name="BetterWays"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Harold D. Miller]] | title = From volume to value: better ways to pay for health care | journal = [[Health Affairs (Project Hope)]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 1418–1428 |date=September–October 2009 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.28.5.1418 | pmid = 19738259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care==
Providers who work under such plans focus on [[preventive health care]], as there is a greater financial reward in the prevention of illness than in the treatment of the ill. Such plans divert providers from the use of expensive treatment options.

==Insurance==
The financial risks providers accept in capitation are traditional [[insurance]] risks. Provider revenues are fixed, and each enrolled patient makes a claims against the full resources of the provider. In exchange for the fixed payment, physicians essentially become the enrolled clients' insurers, who resolve their patients' claims at the point of care and assume the responsibility for their unknown future health care costs.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2001" /&gt; Large providers tend to manage the risk better than do smaller providers because they are better prepared for variations in service demand and costs, but even large providers are inefficient risk managers in comparison to large insurers. Providers tend to be small in comparison to insurers and so are more like individual consumers, whose annual costs as a percentage of their annual cash flow vary far more than do those of large insurers. For example, a capitated eye care program for 25,000 patients is more viable than a capitated eye program for 10,000 patients. The smaller the roster of patients, the greater the variation in annual costs and the more likely that the costs may exceed the resources of the provider. In very small capitation portfolios, a small number of costly patients can dramatically affect a provider's overall costs and increase the provider's risk of insolvency.

Physicians and other health care providers lack the necessary [[actuarial]], [[underwriting]], [[accounting]] and finance skills for insurance risk management, but their most severe problem is the greater variation in their estimates of the average patient cost, which leaves them at a financial disadvantage as compared to insurers whose estimates are far more accurate.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt; Because their risks are a function of portfolio size, providers can reduce their risks only by increasing the numbers of patients they carry on their rosters, but their inefficiency relative to that of the insurers' is far greater than can be mitigated by these increases. To manage risk as efficiently as an insurer, a provider would have to assume 100% of the insurer's portfolio. HMOs and insurers manage their costs better than risk-assuming healthcare providers and cannot make risk-adjusted capitation payments without sacrificing profitability. Risk-transferring entities will enter into such agreements only if they can maintain the levels of profits they achieve by retaining risks.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2010" /&gt;

===Reinsurance===
Providers cannot afford [[reinsurance]], which would further deplete their inadequate capitation payments, as the reinsurer's expected loss costs, expenses, profits and risk loads must be paid by the providers. The goal of reinsurance is to offload risk and reward to the reinsurer in return for more stable operating results, but the provider's additional costs make that impractical. Reinsurance assumes that the insurance-risk-transferring entities do not create inefficiencies when they shift insurance risks to providers.

Without any induced inefficiencies, providers would be able to pass on a portion of their risk premiums to reinsurers, but the premiums that providers would have to receive would exceed the premiums that risk-transferring entities could charge in competitive insurance markets.&lt;ref name="Cox2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2001" /&gt; Reinsurers are wary of contracting with physicians, as they believe that if providers think they can collect more than they pay in premiums, they would tend to revert to the same excesses encouraged by fee-for-service payment systems.

'''Cristina Possas de Albuquerque''' (born 5 June 1948) is a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] and [[emerging infectious disease]]s from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, N., "Epidemiology and the web of causation: has anyone seen the spider?"

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199750351}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, her approach to social ecosystem complexity is quite different from the four-fold eco-social approach of Harvard's Nancy Krieger in that she has proposed in a 2001 English-language article in the ''Brazilian Journal of Public Health Reports'' the concept of "social ecosystem health" where ecosystems are increasingly changed by social human activity, favoring the emergence of diseases, so the term "social" should precede the prefix "eco".&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001. Social ecosystem health: confronting the complexity and emergence of infectious diseases.

Her mentor and former colleague, Dr. [[Richard Levins]], had used the phrase "ecosocial view of health."&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, she is known for (a) developing her new conceptual approach to [[social epidemiology]], incorporating the economic concept of structural heterogeneity into an epidemiological model to identify the epidemiological profiles of heterogeneous populations in different social and economic strata and the conditions for emergence of diseases; (b) contributions of health policy and health reform in Brazil; and research on health transition, ecological change, complex systems, and emergence of new diseases.

She is a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University in Boston,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/fellowships/takemi-fellowship-program/ Takemi Program], [[Harvard T.H.

As a Brazilian Brazilian [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cristina Possas de Albuquerque (Cristina Possas) has as a policymaker long worked closely with public health and environmental scientists and with human rights and social justice civil organizations.

She also is a full professor at [[FIOCRUZ]] in Brazil, where in 1998 she had earned a PhD in [[public health]], and where she now does research on infectious diseases and teaches a course named "Scientific Methodology" in the Masters and Doctoral Programs.

She has been also a Professor of Health Policy at the National School of Public Health at the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], Brazil.  She was nominated in 1987 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health/Fiocruz to be the National Technical Coordinator of seven Groups supporting the Health Reform in Brazil, whose contributions were later incorporated into the new Brazilian 1988 Constitution.

For a decade, she also has been a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University, a Visiting Scientist and [[Fulbright Fellowship|Fulbright Fellow]], and a member of the Harvard New Diseases Group, coordinated by the late [[Richard Levins]] and by [[Tamara Awerbuch-Friedlander]], collaborating with them and other outstanding members of the group in the organizing committee of the Woods Hole Conference on New Diseases, with articles with the group later published in a special supplement of the ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' on this conference and in other journals. She had held for 10 years a national position as the Head of the Research and Development Unit of the Brazilian National AIDS Program.

She has worked for more than five decades in several national and international positions with the scientific community and civil society organizations.  For ten years, she had been National Director of the Research and Technological Development Unit at the Brazilian [[AIDS]] Program in the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which has been recognized globally as an outstanding public health initiative with innovative approaches to the pandemics, always centering on free and universal access to prevention and treatment.  She was invited by the Director of the National AIDS Program to conceive and create a new and innovative Research and Technological Development Unit in the Program’s structure.

She has given interviews on [[AIDS]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqG-W1Xyoac Entrevista, Dr. Cristina Possas discusses AIDS, Dec 16, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[dengue fever|dengue]], and [[zika fever|zika]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Sonoline B by Baby Doppler .jpg|alt=Fetal Heart Rate and Activity Monitor - Baby Doppler |thumb|Fetal Heart Rate and Activity Monitor - Baby Doppler ]]A '''Doppler fetal monitor''' is a hand-held [[ultrasound]] transducer used to detect the [[fetal heartbeat]] for [[prenatal care]].  It uses the [[Doppler effect]] to provide an audible simulation of the heart beat.  Some models also display the [[heart rate]] in beats per minute (BPM). Use of this monitor is sometimes known as '''Doppler [[auscultation]]'''. The Doppler fetal monitor is commonly referred to simply as a ''Doppler'' or ''fetal Doppler''. It may be classified as a form of [[Doppler ultrasonography]] (although usually not technically [[-graphy]] but rather sound-generating).

Doppler fetal monitors provide information about the fetus similar to that provided by a [[fetal stethoscope]]. One advantage of the Doppler fetal monitor over a (purely acoustic) fetal stethoscope is the electronic audio output, which allows people other than the user to hear the heartbeat. One disadvantage is the greater complexity and cost and the lower reliability of an electronic device.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The device was invented in 1958 by Dr. Edward H. Hon,&lt;ref&gt;Roger K. Freeman, Thomas J. Garite, Michael P. Nageotte, ''Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring'' Third Edition, 2003, p. 3. "The earliest preliminary report of FHR monitoring came in 1958 from Edward Hon, MD,... via fetal [[ECG]] monitor on the maternal abdomen."
[https://books.google.com/books?id=WH_1eln4aVgC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=SaSJMoV82p&amp;dq=Edward%20Hon%20doppler%201958&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Hon%20doppler%201958&amp;f=false Google Books citation]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended for use by health care professionals, this device is becoming popular for personal use.

==Types==
Dopplers for home or hospital use differ in the following ways: 
*Manufacturer: popular manufacturers are Baby Doppler, Sonoline, Ultrasound Technologies, Newman Medical, Nicolet (purchased by Natus), Arjo-Huntleigh, and Summit Doppler (now Cooper Surgical). 
*Probe type: waterproof or not.  Waterproof probes are used for [[water birth]]s.
*Probe frequency: 2-[[MHz]] or 3-[[MHz]] probes. Most practitioners can find the heart rate with either probe.  A 3-MHz probe is recommended to detect a heart rate in early pregnancy (8–10 weeks [[gestation]]). A 2-MHz probe is recommended for pregnant women who are overweight. The newer EchoHeart 5-MHz transvaginal probes aids in the detection of fetal heart tones (FHT) early in pregnancy (6–8 weeks) and for patients who have a retroverted uterus or throughout pregnancy for FHT detection for women who are obese.
*Heart rate display: some Dopplers automatically display the heart rate on a built-in LCD; for others the fetal heart rate must be counted and timed by the practitioner.

A major advantage of being able to record and share the recording is that it can be emailed to a healthcare professional to be checked if there are any concerns about whether or not it is the fetus's heart rate and whether or not is normal.  Typically, they work from about 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawes|first=G. S.|date=September 1981|title=Numerical analysis of the human fetal heart rate: The quality of ultrasound records|url=https://www.ajog.org/article/0002-9378(81)90673-6/abstract|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=141|pages=43-52|via=AJOG}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to increasing home usage of clinical fetal doppler systems, the FDA issued a formal statement recommending against at-home use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm095508.htm|title=Avoid Fetal "Keepsake" Images, Heartbeat Monitors|last=Vaezy|first=Shahram|date=December 2014|website=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetal dopplers using 2-3GHz ultrasound are prescription devices designed and developed for use by licensed and trained health care professionals. System misuse (duration, angulation) and systems operating outside of intended range can produce thermal and non-thermal effects on fetal tissue, including the possibility for over-heating fetal tissue and introducing mechanical stress on the fetus due to cavitation, radiation force, and acoustic streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Church|first=Charles|date=April 2007|title=Quantification of risk from fetal exposure to diagnostic ultrasound|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610706000988|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|volume=93|pages=331-353|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=M.J.|date=July 2009|title=Effects of heat on embryos and foetuses|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0265673021000039628|journal=International Journal of Hyperthermia|volume=19|pages=295-324|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The use of the word ''Sonicaid'' for Doppler fetal monitors comes from the products of the UK company [[Sonicaid]] Ltd. Sonicaid products included the D205/206 portable fetal Dopplers and FM2/3/4 series of fetal monitors. The company was acquired by Oxford Instruments in 1987 to form Oxford Sonicaid.

==Doppler auscultation in adults==
It was recently demonstrated that continuous Doppler enables the [[auscultation]] of [[valvular movement]]s and blood flow sounds that are undetected during cardiac examination with a stethoscope in adults. The Doppler auscultation presented a sensitivity of 84% for the detection of [[aortic regurgitation]]s, while classic stethoscope auscultation presented a sensitivity of 58%. Moreover, Doppler auscultation was superior in the detection of impaired ventricular relaxation  Since the physics of Doppler auscultation and classic auscultation are different,  it has been suggested that both methods could complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mc Loughlin MJ, Mc Loughlin S | year = 2012 | title = Cardiac auscultation: Preliminary findings of a pilot study using continuous Wave Doppler and comparison with classic auscultation | url = | journal = Int J Cardiol | volume = 167| issue = | pages = 590–591| doi = 10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.09.223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auscultación Cardíaca Normal Con Estetoscopio Doppler Continuo: Un nuevo método 200 años después de Laennec (Spanish Edition) https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=mc%20loughlin%20santiago&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental Health Officers''' (also known as '''Public Health Inspectors''' or '''Environmental Health Practitioners''') are responsible for carrying out measures for protecting public health, including administering and enforcing legislation related to [[environmental health]] and providing support to minimize health and safety hazards. Environmental Health Practitioners are multi-skilled in many areas with individuals being highly trained, usually to degree level, and often requiring additional professional training, professional competency assessment and continuing professional development in order to continue to practise in the field.
They are involved in a variety of activities, for example inspecting food facilities, investigating public health nuisances, and implementing disease control, conducting work place safety assessments and accident investigation. Environmental health officers are focused on prevention, consultation, investigation, and education of the community regarding health risks and maintaining a safe environment.

EHOs bring to the position an understanding of microbiology, risk assessment, environmental science and technology, food science, knowledge of the built environment as well as the skills and knowledge related to the tracking and control of communicable disease, investigation of environmental health related incidents and criminal investigations. They therefore must also have strong investigative skills and a thorough understanding of the application of legislation related to public health, the built environment, pollution control and workplace safety. Working in partnership with Government Ministries (such as Health, Agriculture and Environment), local municipalities, businesses, community groups, other agencies and individual members of the community, the EHO plays a major role in protecting public health. They are allowed with a permit to select what to inspect.

Some past/historic titles include inspector of nuisances, sanitarian, and sanitary inspector. Other titles that currently exist include environmental health specialist/practitioner/professional, public health officer, health officer, health inspector, and health official. The legal title used will depend on the definitions found in local legislation/jurisdiction.

Environmental health professionals are usually employed by local government or state health authorities to advise on and enforce [[public health]] standards. However, many are employed in the [[private sector]] the [[military]] and other third sector agencies such as charities and NGOs.

==Jobs==
The following represents jobs that can be found in either the public or private sectors:
* Inspection and enforcement services
* Environmental health consulting and education
* Communicable disease investigations and outbreak control
* Food safety course training
* Community planning
* Sewage disposal (septic) systems planning
* Floor plan review and approval
* Housing standards/quality inspection and control
* Urban renewal 
* Pest control
* Emergency contingency planning and implementation
* Noise control
* Air quality monitoring
* Health and safety at work inspection and control
* Water testing (drinking water &amp; recreational water)
* Tobacco control
* Community care facilities licensing
* Public Buildings
* Quality Improvement

The common identifier of environmental health personnel is that they are responsible for the identification, evaluation and management of risks to human health from factors in the environment, whether on behalf of government agencies or commercial and industrial concerns.

==Roles==
A Public Health Inspector (also known as an Environmental Health Officer) investigates health hazards in a wide variety of settings, and will take action to mitigate or eliminate the hazards. Usually the public perception of a health inspector is someone who examines restaurants and ensures they maintain sanitary standards for food safety set by the regulating authority. However, public health inspectors have much broader job duties, including inspecting swimming pools, substandard housing conditions, public schools, day cares, nursing homes, and personal service establishments such as tattoo parlours. Depending on their jurisdiction, Registered Environmental Health Officers often permit and inspect wells, private water systems, and individual subsurface sewage disposal (septic) systems. Other tasks include: campground inspections, tanning salon inspections, beauty salon inspections, correctional facility inspections and mobile home park inspection. The public health inspector (environmental health officer) also plays a vital role in community projects such as those concerning health promotion, tobacco reduction, healthy built environments/healthy communities, food security, and emergency preparedness.
  
They may also respond to complaints such as animal bites, garbage complaints, odor complaints, or sewage overflows. Due to their educational background they can provide information and referrals with regards to; lead, radon, mold, and emerging diseases such as West Nile Virus and Avian Flu. The field also overlaps with hazardous materials (Hazmat) and many Hazmat responders are also Licensed Environmental Health Practitioners or Registered Environmental Health Specialists.

==Working conditions==
Environmental health officers work with many different people in a variety of environments. Their jobs often involve considerable fieldwork, and some travel frequently. Many environmental health officers work long and often irregular hours. They inspect pools, childcare centers, restaurants, septic systems, and many other types of establishments that relate to health and safety.

Environmental health officers may be exposed to many of the same physically strenuous conditions and hazards as industrial employees, and the work may be performed in unpleasant, stressful, and dangerous working conditions. They may find themselves in an adversarial role if the management of an organization disagrees with the recommendations for ensuring a safe working environment.

==History==
The field of environmental health can be traced back to the 1840s in England. [[Edwin Chadwick]], a Poor Law Commissioner, conducted an inquiry into the causes of poverty which concluded that people often became poor because of ill health due to a bad environment. He believed that improving sanitation was the key to breaking this vicious cycle.

Chadwick led a vigorous campaign for change which eventually won over the establishment, resulting in the [[Public Health Act 1848]]. The Act provided for the appointment of Inspectors of Nuisances – the forerunners of today’s environmental health practitioners – in areas of need.

The Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors – the organisation which was to become the United Kingdom's [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]] – was established in 1883. Over subsequent decades, the role of environmental health practitioners changed and grew, with standards of qualification rising until, in the 1960s, it became a graduate profession. The grant of a Royal Charter in 1984 set the seal on this enhanced role and status. As a result of changing roles, the titles have changed over the decades from inspector of nuisances -&gt; sanitary inspector -&gt; public health inspector / environmental health officer (see Inspector of Nuisances below). This is also true internationally, as the titles have changed to reflect the advanced education and roles of environmental health officers today.

===Inspector of Nuisances===
An Inspector of Nuisances was the title of an office in several English-speaking jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions this term is now archaic, the position and/or term having been replaced by others. In the United Kingdom from the mid 19th century this office was generally associated with public health and sanitation.

The first Inspector of Nuisances appointed by a UK local authority Health Committee was [[Thomas Fresh]]  in Liverpool in 1844. Both the 1855 Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act and the Metropolis Management Act 1855 defined such an office but with the title of 'Sanitary Inspector'. In local authorities that had established a Board of Health, the title was 'Inspector of Nuisances'. Eventually the title was standardized across all UK local authorities as 'Sanitary Inspector'. An Act of Parliament later changed the title to 'Public Health Inspector'. Similar offices were established across the British Empire.

The nearest modern equivalent of this position in the UK is an Environmental Health Officer. This title being adopted by local authorities on the recommendation of Central Government after the Local Government Act 1972. Today, Registered UK Environmental Health Officers working in non-enforcement roles (e.g. in the private sector) may prefer to use the generic term 'Environmental Health Practitioner'.

In the United States, a modern example of an officer with the title 'Inspector of Nuisances' but not the public health role is found in Section 3767[7] of the Ohio Revised Code which defines such a position to investigate nuisances, where this term broadly covers establishments in which lewdness and alcohol are found. Whereas in the United States the environmental health officer role in local authorities is taken by officers with the titles 'Registered Environmental Health Specialist' or 'Registered Sanitarian' depending on the jurisdiction. The role in the US Public Health Service is undertaken by Commissioned (uniformed) 'Environmental Health Officers'.

==Qualifications==
Environmental health is a graduate career in most countries. The minimum requirements in most countries include an approved university degree program, field training and professional certification &amp; registration.

===Australia – General===
[[Environmental Health Australia]] accredits Australian Environmental Health Degree and Graduate Diploma programs in accordance with the Environmental Health Australia  [http://accreditation.eh.org.au/ Accreditation Policy] to ensure course content meets nationally consistent requirements for practice as an EHO anywhere in Australia. As at 1 July 2009 there are EHA-accredited Universities in every State and the Northern Territory.

The [http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/pco/prod/FileStore.nsf/Documents/MRDocument:15509H/$FILE/HealthAct1911_14-k0-00.html?OpenElement Health Act 1911 (as amended)] defines the role of 'environmental health officer', and empowers the Executive Director, Public Health to appoint EHOs to local government health authorities and as public health officials employed by State government. The Executive Director, Public Health is advised by the [http://www.public.health.wa.gov.au/3/816/3/environmental_health_officers.pm Western Australia Environmental Health Officer Professional Review Board] on Environmental Health Graduate and Postgraduate qualifications that are deemed suitable to allow practice in Western Australia, and the qualifications are published from time to time in the Government Gazette.

Currently [[Curtin University of Technology]] and [[Edith Cowan University]] offer Environmental Health degrees in Western Australia which are also accredited by Environmental Health Australia.

===New Zealand===
Entrants to the profession must have either a BAppSc Health Protection or BHSc Environmental Health. Alternatively, suitably qualified science graduates can obtain a graduate diploma in environmental health.
* [http://www.nzieh.org.nz Career info]

===Republic of Ireland===
To become an Environmental Health Officer it is necessary to hold an environmental health degree approved by the Department of Health &amp; Children. The study of Environmental Health in Ireland also requires students to undertake a period of professional practice with the Health Service Executive. Following the period of professional practice, competence must then be demonstrated through an experiential learning logbook and oral examination.
* [http://www.ehoa.ie/html/careers.shtml Career info]

===United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland===
EHOs often hold at least an undergraduate (or postgraduate) qualification recognised by (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) the [[Environmental Health Registration Board]].&lt;ref name="Environmental Health Officer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://careersadvice.direct.gov.uk/helpwithyourcareer/jobprofiles/profiles/profile590/ |title=Environmental Health Officer |work=Careers Advice |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924190810/http://careersadvice.direct.gov.uk/helpwithyourcareer/jobprofiles/profiles/profile590/ |archivedate=2008-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Environmental Health Officers/Public Health Inspectors have a university degree in environmental health and a national professional certificate – the [[CPHI(C)|Certificate in Public Health Inspection (Canada), CPHI(C)]]. 
* [http://www.ciphi.ca/boc Career info]

Public Health Inspectors are highly trained individuals whose training include a bachelor's degree in environmental health followed by certification by the [[Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors]] (CIPHI). To become nationally certified, public health inspectors must complete a field training practicum, submit a number of reports and pass the Institute's exam. Some inspectors have additional training in areas such as biology, toxicology and epidemiology.

Only six schools in Canada offer degree programs approved by the CIPHI as meeting the educational component for certification: British Columbia Institute of Technology, Cape Breton University, Concordia University of Edmonton, Conestoga College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, First Nations University of Canada, and Ryerson University. These programs are generally four years long, however fast-track programs are available in some schools for those who have completed a previous science degree.

===Sri Lanka===
[[Public Health Inspector (Sri Lanka)|Public Health Inspectors]] appointed by the Department of Health, must have passed the Public Health Inspectors Examination conducted by the Department of Health to joined the service as a Public Health Inspector Grade III, thereafter they receive training to a Diploma level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15083">'''Enzyte''' is an herbal [[nutritional supplement]] originally manufactured by Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals.  The marketing of Enzyte resulted in a conviction and prison term for the company's owner and bankruptcy of the company. The product is now marketed by Vianda, LLC of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. The manufacturer has claimed that Enzyte promotes "natural [[male enhancement]]," which is a [[euphemism]] for enhancing erectile function. However, its effectiveness has been called into doubt and the claims of the manufacturer have been under scrutiny from various state and federal organizations. Kenneth Goldberg, medical director of the Male Health Center at [[Baylor University]], says, "It makes no sense medically. There's no way that increasing blood flow to the penis, as Enzyte claims to do, will actually increase its size."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-04-18-enzyte.htm |title=Why is this man smiling |publisher=''[[USAToday]]'' |date=2002-04-18 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, following thousands of consumer complaints to the [[Better Business Bureau]], federal agents raided Berkeley facilities, gathering material that resulted in a 112-count [[indictment|criminal indictment]]. The company's founder and CEO, Steven M Warshak and his mother, Harriet Warshak, were found guilty of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit [[mail fraud]], [[bank fraud]], and [[money laundering]], and in September 2008 they were sentenced to prison and ordered to forfeit $500&amp;nbsp;million in assets.&lt;ref name="McKee"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convictions and fines forced the company into [[bankruptcy]], and in December 2008 its assets were sold for $2.75&amp;nbsp;million to investment company Pristine Bay, which continued operations.&lt;ref name="Pristine"&gt;[http://nutrition-de.com/progain-350-und-testinate-250/ "Testinate 250, ultimate testosterone booster" - January 15, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106143203/http://nutrition-de.com/progain-350-und-testinate-250/ |date=January 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enzyte is widely advertised on U.S. television as "the once daily tablet for natural male enhancement." The commercials feature a character known as "Smilin' Bob," acted out by Canadian actor Andrew Olcott, who, in the commercials, always wears a smile that is implied to be caused by the enhancing effects of Enzyte; these advertisements feature [[double entendre]]s. Some such commercials also feature an equally smiling "Mrs. Bob." (Olcott, who was married and a father in real life, was also a visual artist, and he later owned and operated a small advertising firm.)

Because Enzyte is an herbal product, no testing is required by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]. An official of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] division that monitors advertising says the lack of scientific testing is "a red flag right away. There's no science behind these claims."&lt;ref name="Newsday"/&gt; The company has conceded that it has no scientific studies that substantiate any of its Enzyte claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43388-2004Sep22.html |title=TV Ads for Sex Supplement Challenged |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2004-09-23|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ira Sharlip, a spokesman for the [[American Urological Association]], has said, "There is no such thing as a penis pill that works. These are all things that are sold for profit. There's no science or substance behind them."&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/345405781.html?dids=345405781:345405781&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+10%2C+2003&amp;author=Dawn+Wotapka.+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;desc=%27No+Science%27+Behind+Male+Pill%27s+Claims+%2F+Best+bet%3F+Deal+with+it&amp;pqatl=google 'No Science' Behind Male Pill's Claims / Best bet?

==Ingredients==
Enzyte's formulation was reportedly developed for Vianda by Marilyn Barrett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Barrett | first = Marilyn | title = Providing a Scientific Foundation for Herbal Medicine | publisher = Pharmacognosy.com | year = 2015 | url = http://pharmacognosy.com | accessdate = 2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enzyte is said to contain:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Supplements | first = Vianda | title = Enzyte - Official Enzyte 24/7, male enhancement and performance leader from Vianda | publisher = ViandaLife.com | year = 2015 | url = http://viandalife.com/prod-mens-enzyte-247.aspx#tabsINGREDIENTS | accessdate = 2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asian Ginseng Root Extract
* Grape Seed Extract
* ''[[Epimedium]]'' (Horny Goat Weed)
* [[Zinc oxide]]
* [[Muira puama]]
* ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]''
* [[Niacin]]
* [[Copper]]

Most of the above ingredients are commonly available as [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] herbal or dietary supplements, and most have anecdotal reports, but marginal or unproven scientific evidence, of efficacy on various systems in the human body. Several of the herbal ingredients are included only in very low quantities.

One notable ingredient, [[yohimbe]], was included in the original formulation of Enzyte, produced until at least 2004; however, as yohimbe's legal status in Canada is unclear, Enzyte produced after 2004 no longer contains yohimbe extract.

Additionally, zinc is an ingredient in Enzyte. Some men who have low zinc levels in their body have had success using zinc supplements to treat erection problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rhodes |first=Monica |title=Erection Problems (Erectile Dysfunction) |publisher=NYU Langone Medical Center |year=2006 |url=http://www.med.nyu.edu/healthwise/article.html?hwid=hw112768 |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823234649/http://www.med.nyu.edu/healthwise/article.html?hwid=hw112768 |archivedate=2010-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Currently, the effectiveness of Enzyte is unproven.

A civil lawsuit alleged Enzyte does not work as advertised.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hagens-berman.com/files/enzytefaq1090006698639.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite manufacturer claims that Enzyte will increase penis size, girth, and firmness and improve sexual performance, there exists no scientific evidence that Enzyte is capable of making good on these claims. In fact, Enzyte has never been scientifically tested by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] or other independent third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casewatch.org/cp/enzytecmp.pdf |title=Enzyte Complaint - Final Version (00009634.DOC;1) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Enzyte is required by current U.S. law to be marketed as an [[herbal supplement]] and may not legally be called a drug. In keeping with FTC rulings, Enzyte is not allowed to claim these benefits in its advertising. However, as of June 2010, TV commercials for the product still use the phrase "natural male enhancement."

== Federal indictment and trial==
Thousands of consumer complaints were made to the [[Better Business Bureau]] about the company's business practices, especially the "autoship" program that repeatedly charged customers' credit cards for refills even after they canceled their orders. Federal agents raided Berkeley facilities in March 2005, gathering material that led to criminal charges. On September 21, 2006, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals; its owner and president, Steve Warshak; and five other individuals were indicted by the United States, Southern District of Ohio, U.S. Attorney Greg Lockhart, on charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[money laundering]], and [[Mail fraud|mail]], wire, and bank fraud. The indictment alleged that the company defrauded consumers and banks of [[United States dollar|US$]]100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="McKee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxIndict"&gt;{{cite news |title='Natural Male Enhancement' Company Owner Indicted on Fraud, Other Charges |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215087,00.html?sPage=fnc.national/crime |work=FOXNews.com |agency=Associated Press |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], and other agencies participated in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In testimony during the trial, a former executive with Berkeley testified that the enhancements the company claimed were achieved by use of Enzyte were fabricated, and the company defrauded customers by continuing to charge them for additional shipments of the supplement. He further testified that company employees were instructed to make it as difficult as possible for unhappy customers to receive refunds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Conviction and sentencing ===
On February 22, 2008, Steven 
Warshak was found guilty of 93 counts of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering. On August 27, 2008, he was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Arthur Spiegel to 25&amp;nbsp;years in prison and ordered to pay $93,000 in fines. Warshak was an inmate at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Elkton|Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Elkton, Ohio]]. His company, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals, along with other defendants, was ordered to forfeit $500&amp;nbsp;million. His 75-year-old mother, Harriet Warshak, was sentenced to two years in prison&lt;ref&gt;New York Times "Ohio company owner gets 25&amp;nbsp;years in fraud case." https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Enzyte-Maker-Sentencing.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Kinney |title=Ohio company owner gets 25 years in fraud case |work= |agency=Associated Press |date=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but released on bond pending appeal after turning over her house, bank accounts, and other assets related to her crimes.&lt;ref name=grandmother&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2009/07/22/Smilin-Bob-grandmother-avoids-jail/UPI-82631248302461/ |title='Smilin' Bob' grandmother avoids jail |publisher=Upi.com |date=2009-07-22 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Steven and Harriet Warshak appealed their convictions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in ''[[United States v. Warshak]]'' (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2010) 631 F.3d 266, upheld Steven Warshak's convictions and all convictions against Harriet Warshak except for money laundering and vacated their sentences, remanding the sentencing to the lower court.

On September 21, 2011, Steven Warshak's sentence was reduced from 25 years to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[Warshak's 25-year sentence cut to 10 - Cincinnati.com http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20110920/NEWS010702/109210332/Warshak-s-25-year-sentence-cut-10]&lt;/ref&gt; With credit for time served, he could be out in five years. His mother's sentence was reduced from two years to one day, and she never served any time in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communitypress.cincinnati.com/article/AB/20110914/NEWS010702/109150312/Warshak-s-mom-has-sentence-cut-1-day Warshak's mom has sentence reduced - Cincinnati.com ]&lt;/ref&gt; Factors in reducing the sentence were that the amount of total loss by customers may have been less than $400 million and that the sentences of co-defendants were only two years. Warshak was released from prison on June 14, 2017 according to the Federal Prison Inmate Locator system.

==Continued company operation==
The Warshaks' convictions and fines forced the company into [[bankruptcy]]. In December 2008, its assets were acquired from bankruptcy court for $2.75&amp;nbsp;million by investment company Pristine Bay, which is affiliated with Cincinnati developer Chuck Kubicki. Kubicki said he wanted to save the jobs of the company's 200&amp;nbsp;employees and retain a major tenant in one of his properties in suburban Cincinnati at [[Forest Park, Ohio]]. He said he would change the company name but would keep the brand.&lt;ref name="Pristine"/&gt; In March 2009, Hamilton County commissioners unanimously voted to give a $195,000 property tax break to the company based on projected jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[County gives 'Smilin Bob' tax break http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090325/NEWS0108/303250061/-1/today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Tax breaks keep Berkeley in Forest Park http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2009/03/23/daily34.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, the company name was changed to Vianda LLC. In a press release, the company announced plans to expand, hiring as many as 400 additional workers.&lt;ref name="Vianda"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|last=Bernard-Kuhn|first=Lisa|date=2009-06-27|title=Enzyte firm changes name, adding jobs|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090626/BIZ01/906270333/Enzyte+firm+changes+name}} Link Missing/Removal&lt;/ref&gt; On December&amp;nbsp;14, 2009, Cincinnati Business Courier reported employment of 180, revision of sales projections of 400% growth to $120&amp;nbsp;million downward to an estimated 33% growth to $40&amp;nbsp;million, management team changes, and continued customer complaints of improper billing.&lt;ref&gt;[Cincinnati's Chuck Kubicki juggles lineup at Vianda http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2009/12/14/story1.html?page=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''erection''' (clinically: '''penile erection''' or '''penile tumescence''') is a physiological phenomenon in which the [[penis]] becomes firm, engorged, and enlarged. Penile erection is the result of a complex interaction of psychological, neural, vascular, and endocrine factors, and is often associated with [[sexual arousal]] or [[sexual attraction]], although erections can also be spontaneous. The shape, angle, and direction of an erection varies considerably in humans.

Physiologically, erection is triggered by the [[parasympathetic]] division of the [[autonomic nervous system]], causing [[nitric oxide]] (a  [[vasodilation|vasodilator]]) levels to rise in the  [[Trabeculae of corpora cavernosa of penis|trabecular]] [[artery|arteries]] and [[smooth muscle]] of the penis. The arteries  [[Vasodilation|dilate]] causing the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] of the penis (and to a lesser extent the [[corpus spongiosum]]) to fill with [[blood]]; simultaneously the [[ischiocavernosus muscle|ischiocavernosus]] and [[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbospongiosus]] muscles compress the [[vein]]s of the corpora cavernosa restricting the egress and circulation of this blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic activity reduces to baseline.

As an autonomic nervous system response, an erection may result from a variety of stimuli, including [[sexual stimulation]] and [[sexual arousal]], and is therefore not entirely under conscious control. Erections during sleep or upon waking up are known as [[nocturnal penile tumescence]] (NPT). Absence of nocturnal erection is commonly used to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[impotence]].

The state of a penis which is partly, but not fully, erect is sometimes known as semi-erection (clinically: '''partial tumescence'''); a penis which is not erect is typically referred to as being flaccid, or soft.

==Physiology==

[[File:Erection Development V2.jpg|thumb|Composite image showing the development of a penile erection with Peyronie's disease]]
An erection occurs when two tubular structures, called the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]], that run the length of the penis, become engorged with [[venous blood]]. This may result from any of various [[physiology|physiological]] stimuli, also known as [[sexual stimulation]] and [[sexual arousal]]. The [[corpus spongiosum]] is a single tubular structure located just below the corpora cavernosa, which contains the [[urethra]], through which [[urine]] and [[semen]] pass during [[urination]] and [[ejaculation]] respectively. This may also become slightly engorged with blood, but less so than the corpora cavernosa.

The [[scrotum]] may, but not always, become tightened during erection. Generally, the [[foreskin]] automatically and gradually retracts, exposing the [[glans penis|glans]], though some men may have to manually retract their foreskin.

===Autonomic control===
In the presence of mechanical stimulation, erection is initiated by the [[parasympathetic]] division of the [[autonomic nervous system]] with minimal input from the [[central nervous system]]. Parasympathetic branches extend from the [[sacral plexus]] into the [[arteries]] supplying the erectile tissue; upon stimulation, these nerve branches release [[acetylcholine]], which in turn causes release of [[nitric oxide]] from [[endothelial cell]]s in the [[Trabeculae of corpora cavernosa of penis|trabecular]] arteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/legacy/college/boyer/0470003790/cutting_edge/viagra/viagra.gif wiley.com &gt; Viagra function image] Retrieved on Mars 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Nitric oxide diffuses to the [[smooth muscle]] of the arteries (called ''trabecular smooth muscle''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vascularweb.org/APDVS/BasicScienceCurriculum/Pages/AnatomyandPhysiologyofNormalErection.aspx APDVS &gt; 31. Anatomy and Physiology of Normal Erection] Retrieved on Mars 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;), acting as a [[vasodilation|vasodilating]] agent.&lt;ref name=Marieb&gt;{{cite book | last = Marieb | first = Elaine | title = Anatomy &amp; physiology | publisher = Benjamin-Cummings | location =  | page= 895 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780321887603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;       The arteries dilate, filling the ''corpus spongiosum'' and ''corpora cavernosa'' with blood.  The [[ischiocavernosus muscle|ischiocavernosus]] and [[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbospongiosus]] muscles also compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa, limiting the venous drainage of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Keith|title=Essential Clinical Anatomy, Third Edition|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=0-7817-6274-X|page=265|author2=Anne Agur}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erection subsides when parasympathetic stimulation is discontinued; baseline stimulation from the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic division]] of the autonomic nervous system causes constriction of the penile arteries, forcing blood out of the erectile tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Richard, Wayne Vogl and Adam Mitchell, Grey's Anatomy for Students. Philadelphia, 2004. ({{ISBN|0-443-06612-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[ejaculation]] or cessation of stimulation, erection usually subsides, but the time taken may vary depending on the length and thickness of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Robie H. (et al.), It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex And Sexual Health. Boston, 1994. ({{ISBN|1-56402-199-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary and involuntary control===
The [[cerebral cortex]] can initiate erection in the absence of direct mechanical stimulation (in response to visual, auditory, olfactory, imagined, or tactile stimuli) acting through erectile centers in the lumbar and sacral regions of the [[spinal cord]]. The cortex may suppress erection, even in the presence of mechanical stimulation, as may other psychological, emotional, and environmental factors.

=== Nocturnal erection ===
{{main article|nocturnal penile tumescence}}
The penis may erect during sleep or be erect on waking up. Such an erection is medically known as [[nocturnal penile tumescence]] (informally: ''morning wood'' or ''morning glory'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizemed.com/morning-erections/ Morning Erections: Sizemed] retrieved 28 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After Prostate Cancer: A What-Comes-Next Guide to a Safe and Informed recovery: p.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Listen To Your Hormones, Abraham Harvey Kryger - 2004. p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Janell L.

== Socio-sexual aspects ==
===Social===
Erection is a common indicator of [[sexual arousal]] and is required for a male to effect vaginal penetration and [[sexual intercourse]].

Erections are common for children and infants, and even occur before birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livestrong.com/article/267344-erections-in-babies/ erections in babies] retrieved 11 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching [[puberty]], erections occur much more frequently.&lt;ref name="Madaras2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynda Madaras|title=What's Happening to My Body?

An unusual aversion to the erect penis is sometimes referred to as [[phallophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldblatt|first1=Howard|title=Worlds Apart: Recent Chinese Writing and Its Audiences|date=1990|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spontaneous or random erections===
Spontaneous erection, also known as involuntary, random or unwanted erection, is commonplace and a normal part of male physiology. Socially, such erections can be [[embarrassment|embarrassing]] if they happen in public or when undesired.&lt;ref name="Madaras2007"/&gt; Erections can occur spontaneously at any time of day, and if clothed may cause a bulge which (if required)  can be disguised or hidden by wearing close-fitting underwear, a long shirt, or baggier clothes.&lt;ref name="Attwood2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Attwood|title=Making Sense of Sex: A Forthright Guide to Puberty, Sex and Relationships for People with Asperger's Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLqwYAzogiwC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=15 May 2008|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-84642-797-8|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erect penis shaved.JPG|thumb|right|An erect human penis]]
The length of the flaccid penis does not necessarily correspond to the length of the penis when it becomes erect; some smaller flaccid penises grow much longer, while some larger flaccid penises grow comparatively less.&lt;ref name=kinsey&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kinsey Institute|year=2009|title=Penis Size FAQ &amp; Bibliography |url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/bib-penis.html |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally, the size of an erect penis is fixed throughout post-[[puberty|pubescent]] life. Its size may be increased by surgery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li CY, Kayes O, Kell PD, Christopher N, Minhas S, Ralph DJ |title=Penile suspensory ligament division for penile augmentation: indications and results |journal=Eur. Urol. |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=729–733 |year=2006 |pmid=16473458 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2006.01.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[penis enlargement|penile enlargement]] is controversial, and a majority of men were "not satisfied" with the results, according to one study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Fox News]] |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/02/16/most-men-unsatisfied-with-penis-enlargement-results/ |title=Most Men Unsatisfied With Penis Enlargement Results |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the average size of a human erect penis, a study of 15,521 men, and the best research to date on the topic, as the subjects were measured by health professionals, rather than self-measured, has concluded that the average length of an erect human penis is 13.12 cm (5.17 inches) long, while the average circumference of an erect human penis is 11.66 cm (4.59 inches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2015/03/03/is_your_penis_normal_theres_a_chart_for_that_109106.html|title=Is Your Penis Normal? There's a Chart for That - RealClearScience|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direction===
Although many erect penises point upwards, it is common and normal for the erect penis to point nearly vertically upwards or nearly vertically downwards or even horizontally straight forward, all depending on the tension of the suspensory ligament that holds it in position. An erect penis can also take on a number of different shapes, ranging from a straight tube to a tube with a curvature up or down or to the left or right. An increase in penile curvature can be caused by  [[Peyronie's disease]]. This may cause physical and psychological effects for the affected individual, which could include [[erectile dysfunction]] or pain during an erection. Treatments include oral medication (such as [[colchicine]]) or surgery, which is most often reserved as a last resort.

The following table shows how common various erection angles are for a standing male. In the table, zero degrees (0°) is pointing straight up against the abdomen, 90 degrees is horizontal and pointing straight forward, while 180 degrees would be pointing straight down to the feet. An upward pointing angle is most common.

== Medical conditions ==

=== Erectile dysfunction===
{{Main article|Erectile dysfunction}}

Erectile dysfunction (also known as ED or "(male) impotence") is a [[sexual dysfunction]] characterized by the inability to develop and/or maintain an erection.&lt;ref&gt;Milsten, Richard (et al.), The Sexual Male. Problems And Solutions. London, 2000. ({{ISBN|0-393-32127-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16828320"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sadeghipour H, Ghasemi M, Ebrahimi F, Dehpour AR |title=Effect of lithium on endothelium-dependent and neurogenic relaxation of rat corpus cavernosum: role of nitric oxide pathway |journal=Nitric Oxide |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=54–63 |year=2007 |pmid=16828320 |doi=10.1016/j.niox.2006.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of erectile dysfunction within medicine is known as [[andrology]], a sub-field within [[urology]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Warwick, It's Up To You: Overcoming Erection Problems. London, 1989. ({{ISBN|0-7225-1915-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Erectile dysfunction occurs for a variety of reasons. Please see below and also refer to the separate entry on [[erectile dysfunction]] and the references therein. Ultimately, the cause for erectile dysfunction is that not enough Nitrous oxide (NO) is released by the vascular [[endothelium]] of the branches of the [[perineal artery]], a branch of the [[internal pudendal artery]]. 
     
Erectile dysfunction can occur due to both [[physiological]] and [[psychological]] reasons, most of which are amenable to treatment. Common physiological reasons include diabetes, kidney disease, chronic alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, vascular disease, and neurologic disease which collectively account for about 70 percent of ED cases.&lt;ref name=Marieb/&gt; Some drugs used to treat other conditions, such as [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] and [[paroxetine]], may cause erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref name="pmid16828320"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sadeghipour H, Ghasemi M, Nobakht M, Ebrahimi F, Dehpour AR |title=Effect of chronic lithium administration on endothelium-dependent relaxation of rat corpus cavernosum: the role of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase pathways |journal=BJU Int. |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=177–182 |year=2007 |pmid=17034495 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06530.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erectile dysfunction, tied closely as it is to cultural notions of [[Virility|potency]], [[social status|success]] and [[masculinity]], can have devastating psychological consequences including feelings of [[shame]], [[Grief|loss]] or inadequacy;&lt;ref&gt;Tanagho, Emil A. (et al.), Smith's General Urology. London, 2000. ({{ISBN|0-8385-8607-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong [[conspiracy of silence (expression)|culture of silence]] and inability to discuss the matter. In fact, around one in ten men will experience recurring impotence problems at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Erectile-dysfunction/Pages/Introduction.aspx?url=Pages/what-is-it.aspx|title=Erectile dysfunction (impotence)|website=nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Priapism ===
[[Priapism]] is a painful condition in which the penis does not return to its flaccid state, despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation. Priapism lasting over four hours is a medical emergency.

At the time of penetration, the [[canine penis]] is not erect, and only able to penetrate the female because it includes a narrow bone called the [[baculum]], a feature of most [[placental mammals]]. After the male achieves penetration, he will often hold the female tighter and thrust faster, and it is during this time that the male's penis expands. Unlike human sexual intercourse, where the male penis commonly becomes erect before entering the female, canine copulation involves the male first penetrating the female, after which swelling of the penis to erection occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/dog.html |title=Semen Collection from Dogs |publisher=Arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu |date=2002-09-14 |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205044421/http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/dog.html |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[elephant's penis]] is S-shaped when fully erect and has a Y-shaped [[External urethral orifice (male)|orifice]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoshani, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the small amount of erectile tissue in a [[bull's penis]], there is little enlargement after erection. The penis is quite rigid when non-erect, and becomes even more rigid during erection. Protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the [[retractor penis muscle]] and straightening of the sigmoid flexure.&lt;ref name="Reece2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=William O.

==Terminology==
{{Wiktionary|penis}}
Clinically, erection is often known as "penile erection", and the state of being erect, and process of erection, are described as "tumescence" or "penile tumescence". The term for the subsiding or cessation of an erection is "[[wikt:detumescence|detumescence]]".

[[Colloquialism|Colloquially]] and in [[slang]], erection is known by many informal terms. Commonly encountered [[English language|English]] terms include 'stiffy', 'hard-on', 'boner' and 'woody'.&lt;ref name="Morrissey2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabrielle Morrissey|title=Urge: Hot Secrets For Great Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRx_227VB7cC&amp;pg=PT6|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=27 January 2005|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-7304-4527-2|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several slang words, euphemisms and synonyoms for an erection in English and in other languages.

'''Ergosterol''' (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a [[sterol]] found in [[cell membrane]]s of [[fungus|fungi]] and [[protozoa]], serving many of the same functions that [[cholesterol]] serves in [[animal]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.  Because many fungi and protozoa cannot survive without ergosterol, the [[enzymes]] that synthesize it have become important targets for [[drug discovery]]. Ergosterol is a [[provitamin]] form of [[Ergocalciferol|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]; exposure to [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light causes a chemical reaction that produces vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Role in fungi==
Ergosterol (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a [[sterol]] found in fungi, and named for [[ergot]], the common name of members of the fungal genus ''[[Claviceps]]'' from which ergosterol was first isolated.  Ergosterol is a component of [[yeast]] and other [[fungus|fungal]] [[cell membrane]]s, serving many of the same functions that [[cholesterol]] serves in [[animal]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Weete JD, Abril M, Blackwell M.
Phylogenetic distribution of fungal sterols. PLoS One. 2010 May 28;5(5):e10899. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0010899. {{PMID|20526375}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its specificity in higher fungi is thought to be related to the climatic instabilities (highly varying humidity and moisture conditions) encountered by these organisms in their typical ecological niches (plant and animal surfaces, soil). Thus, despite the added energy requirements of ergosterol synthesis (if compared to cholesterol), ergosterol is thought to have evolved as a nearly ubiquitous, evolutionarily advantageous fungal alternative to cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dupont S. |author2=Lemetais G. |author3=Ferreira T. |author4=Cayot P. |author5=Gervais P. |author6=Beney L. | year = 2012 | title = Ergosterol biosynthesis: a fungal pathway for life on land? | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01667.x/full | journal = Evolution | volume = 66 | issue = 9| pages = 2961–2968 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01667.x | pmid=22946816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Target for antifungal drugs ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Because ergosterol is present in cell membranes of fungi, yet absent in those of animals, it is a useful target for [[antifungal drug]]s.  Ergosterol is also present in the cell membranes of some protists, such as [[Trypanosomatida|trypanosome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roberts CW, McLeod R, Rice DW, Ginger M, Chance ML, Goad LJ |title=Fatty acid and sterol metabolism: potential antimicrobial targets in apicomplexan and trypanosomatid parasitic protozoa |journal=Mol.

[[Amphotericin B]], an antifungal drug, targets ergosterol. It binds physically to ergosterol within the membrane, thus creating a polar pore in fungal membranes. This causes ions (predominantly [[potassium]] and [[protons]]) and other molecules to leak out, which will kill the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis D |title=Amphotericin B: spectrum and resistance |journal=J.

[[Fluconazole]], [[miconazole]], [[itraconazole]], and [[clotrimazole]] work in a different way, inhibiting synthesis of ergosterol from [[lanosterol]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; by interfering with [[Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase|14α-demethylase]].&lt;ref name="lv"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The synthesis, regulation, and functions of sterols in Candida albicans: Well-known but still lots to learn |journal=Virulence|volume=7|issue=6|pages=649–659|doi=10.1080/21505594.2016.1188236|pmid=27221657|pmc=4991322|year=2016 |last1=Lv |first1=Quan-Zhen |last2=Yan|first2=Lan|last3=Jiang|first3=Yuan-Ying}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ergosterol is a smaller molecule than lanosterol; it is synthesized by combining two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a 15-carbon-long terpenoid, into lanosterol, which has 30 carbons. Then, two methyl groups are removed, making ergosterol. The "azole" class of antifungal agents [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] the enzyme that performs these [[demethylation]] steps in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and ergosterol.&lt;ref name=lv/&gt;

== As a vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor ==

Ergosterol is a [[provitamin|biological precursor]] of [[Ergocalciferol|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the chemical name of which is [[ergocalciferol]].  Exposure to [[ultraviolet light]] causes a [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reaction that converts ergosterol to ergocalciferol.&lt;ref&gt;Haytowitz, DB [http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Articles/AICR09_Mushroom_VitD.pdf Vitamin D in Mushrooms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;Arnold Lippert Hirsch.

Academic Press, May 12, 2011  {{ISBN|978-0123819789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This happens naturally to a certain extent, and many mushrooms are irradiated after harvest to increase their Vitamin D content.   Fungi are also grown industrially so that ergosterol can be extracted and converted to Vitamin D for sale as a [[dietary supplement]] and [[food additive]].&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt;

Preparations of irradiated ergosterol containing a mixture of previtamin and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were called Viosterol in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Science Service (1930) [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed007p166 Viosterol official name for irradiated ergosterol], J. Chem. Educ. 7(1) 166, DOI: 10.1021/ed007p166 Accessed 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toxicity ==
Ergosterol powder is an irritant to skin, eyes, and the respiratory tract. Ingestion of large amounts can cause [[hypercalcemia]], which (if prolonged) can lead to calcium salt deposits in the soft tissues and, in particular, the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/28224.htm Material Safety Data Sheet], Fisher Scientific&lt;/ref&gt;

International competitions are organized regularly by the ''International FitKid Division'', in addition to national competitions. A routine stands of four types of elements: strength, flexibility, acrobatics, and jumps. All elements are graded by difficulty from A to H. A elements being worth 0.1 points, B 0.2, C 0.3, and so on until H which is worth 0.8. Routines get evaluated in three categories: technique, artistry, and content (execution of elements). Competition is divided by age groups (I. to IX. (or Senior in A category)), and categories ( which are based on knowledge). There three categories (from hardest to easiest) A, B, and C, also called Dance. In each categories there are group and individual routines. In C Category (here group routines are also called Dance Show) team member can go from 4 to 8. In A and B category there are duos, small groups (3-4), and big groups (5-6). In C category, individually 4 elements have to be performed ( one from each type), A or B difficulty, and in groups, two are optional. In B category individually  8 elements need to be performed ( two from each type) A-D difficulty ( but max. two elements can be D), and in groups 4 (same as C category individual). In A category team and individual, 8 elements need to be performed (same as B category) and an acrobatic connection is optional. Skills in A category can be any difficulty. &lt;ref&gt;[http://fitkiddivision.org/?page_id=70 Competitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

(Jacobson, 2013) The difference between the disability and impairment is that disability is the restriction of the ability caused by the actual decrement of functioning, aka impairment, of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=World Report on Disability.|last=World Health Organisation|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geography of disability studies the experience of disabled people and examines the relationship between the disability and space, ranging from the accessibility, mobility and the landscape, in terms of socio-economic, environmental and political perspectives. Hawkesworth, a scholar refers the Geography of disability as “a set of discursive and performative practice”, which intersects more with in the social and cultural aspects, instead of solely on the physical impairment.

According to the World report on disability published by the World Health Organisation, around 15% of the world population, which is approximately 1.14billion people, lives with a disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe and America, the disability ratio is one in five people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are some major factors that give rise to the risk of non-congenital disability, which are age, their living environment, their gender and the access to healthcare. The report had shown that there is a strong correlation between age and the risk of disability, the elder tends to have a higher risk of disability such as Alzheimer, cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a global correlation between the disability and poverty due to the short of resources and government investment to medical service, and lack of access to healthcare. Inadequate infrastructure and investment could worsen the condition. In Australia, a research on disability conducted by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra had demonstrated a strong correlation that the more economically disadvantaged area or community people living in, the higher probability of these people will suffer from disability problem or severe disability, justified by the social gradient of disability correlation coefficient. The likelihood of having severe disability of the population who live in the disadvantaged area in Sydney were 2.6% higher than the population who live in the most economically and socially advantaged area in Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319908376|title=The geography of disability and economic disadvantage in Australian capital cities|last=Louise.|first=O'Rance,|date=2009|publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|others=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.|isbn=9781740249102|location=Canberra|oclc=319908376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlation could also be seen in the United State. In the US, according to the 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report conducted by Institute on Disability/UCED of University of New Hampshire, the distribution of people with disabilities aged from 18-64 has concentrated in the Southeast United States, including Georgia Tennesse, Louisiana and Arkansas etc, which are also the most economically disadvantaged area among the state. For examples, in Memphis, Tennesse, a city with 26.2% poverty rate is also one of the cities with the densest disabled population, 12.6%-17.8% of its working population (aged from 18-64) live with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/21/economic-blight-50-worst-american-cities-live/415609001/|title=These are America's worst cities for crime, employment, housing costs|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://disabilitycompendium.org/sites/default/files/user-uploads/2017_AnnualReport_2017_FINAL.pdf|title=2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report|last=Kraus, L., Lauer, E., Coleman, R., and Houtenville, A.|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures also indicated that female is riskier of being disability than male regardless of their age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe, according to the Eurostat, women are 3% more prone to suffering from a longstanding health problem, daily activity difficulties or both than men in Europe in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Disability_statistics_-_health|title=Disability statistics - health - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Recent development of Geography of Disability: [https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf] ===
Geography scholars had been recognizing the issues of disability since the 1930s. The study has then been extended to a range of socio-spatial processes relating to the issue arisen from disability, that interacts among power, space, and society. There were some analyses of disability within the socio-spatial perspectives, though these analyses tended to isolate from each other instead of integrating all ideas together as a critical discourse.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also changed the definition of disability from a medical point of view towards the socio-spatial determinants.

Imrie, explained the recent development in ''The Geographies of Disability'' as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

“An opening observation is that what has emerged, since the mid 1990’s, has been a broadening of the substantive focus of studies of space and disability, beyond some of the earlier foci of health, cognition and behaviour, welfare, design, and architecture. In particular, the study of disability is evident in most parts of human geography, and not just confined to a specialist or sub-part of the discipline.

However, up to the early 1990’s, the study of geography and disability had been the preserve of specific niche areas of research activity, with some scholars, like Park et al (1998), suggesting that human geography had rarely engaged with studies of 7 disability.’’

The narratives and discursive practices, suggested by Hawkesworth, is also emerged in the geography of disability studies. It has developed to the interrelationships between the body, the feeling of a place and disability, suggested by Imrie, which lead to a wider and deeper scope and the focus of the studies especially regarding to different age groups with different extent and types of disability, for examples, children with learning difficulties vs elderly people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The socio-economic of disability ==

The disabled are often seen as the oppressive socialization of a given form of physiological difference, experiencing who suffer the common socially.

=== The models of disability ===
(link to an external article: Social Model of disability [[Social model of disability|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability]] )

The medical model of refers Disability as the physical problem, the incapability of a disabled person to perform as ‘normal’ as a person that has no disability. Disability intrigues a further disclosure on easing the inconvenience and improving a disabled’s daily experience. For example, introducing advanced assistive devices or aids like mobile wheelchair for disabled individuals who live on their own. On the other hand,  the social model of disability evokes the idea of social integration through demonstrating the difficulties faced by the disabled in the wake of their physical or mental functioning decrement. The social model of disability encourages the mainstream social and cultural structure to accommodate the disabled individuals with more assistive infrastructure and social attitude.

In the Geography of disability, the research mainly focuses on discussing the relationships between the disabled, their basic human rights and the social development, as in the inclusion and the marginalization. This was one of the main study to research and approach the disabled’s need, address the problem without additional negative effects or embarrassment to the disabled pupils.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of the disabilities do not have equal access to the resources aka the materiality or the basic human rights aka the non-materiality inequality as ‘the normal’ population, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. . Their weak and limited physical ability led to higher and extreme level of difficulty to make earning and accumulate wealth by their own power as a non-disabled. This, as a result, make it more difficult for them to live out of poverty or economic disadvantage. What’s more, discrimination, inequality and social exclusion reflected from the ‘mainstream’ society and thus received by the disabled population in different areas creates a virus circle of the disabled experience. Children and teenagers who has learning difficulties is more likely to cause them a discrimination, getting rejected by the mainstream school. The young disabled population aged 15–24 are 10 times more prone to receiving discrimination than the elder disabled population aged 65 and over. And it seems to them doomed to be/ inevitably be socially marginalized and excluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imrie(2007) further described in his article of how the geographical research methodology is carried out and work well for the social research on disabled people.

“Hall and Kearns (2001: 243), for example, comment that ‘traditional’ research methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, ‘can fail to represent the geographical lives of intellectually disabled people’ (also, see Hall, 2004). Similarly, a project by Kitchin (2000), about the opinions of disabled people about social research, shows that most do not like the use of methods that fail to capture the complexities of disability. Such methods include pre-set questions that collect quantitative data and statistics. These observations suggest that the use of particular qualitative or interpretative methods are a preferred way of giving voice to disabled people’s experiences, and open up scope for inclusive research practices. In this respect, there have been some important methodological developments in geographical research that seek to articulate the different ways that disabled people know and experience the world.“&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Environmental politics of Disability  ==

=== The environmental politics of Disability ===
A disabled person’s origin and living environment, including the mobility, accessibility, space, living condition, greatly determine and impact his daily experience, and even affect his physical and mental condition. Space, resources, and investment to be invested in the infrastructure needed by the disabled population are somehow considered to be ‘extra’, as the mainstream society has neglected, somehow judged and less inclined to put forward about it. One of the aim to be achieved through the geography studies of disability is to  highlight the issue and problem the disabled population come across on daily basis so as to create a more including and less-tension society and community.

=== Accessible Tourism ===
The concept of the Accessible tourism is one of the significant developments derived from the development of the geography of disability. The idea behind the accessible tourism is to strive for a basic human right for the disabled to participate in tourism, and to promote the best accessibility practices in tourism by engaging representatives of international tourism sector as well as the representatives of disabled individuals and also non-governmental parties to cooperate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajadacz|first=Alina|date=2015-01-01|title=The Contribution Of The Geography Of Disability To The Development Of ‘Accessible Tourism’|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/tour/25/1/article-p19.xml|journal=Turyzm|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.2478/tour-2014-0016|issn=0867-5856}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the development of disability researches, along with the awareness of the need of tourists, the concept and the idea of accessible tourism which aim to promote ‘tourism without barriers’ has gradually drawn people’s attention as well as the World Tourism Organisation’s publication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism UNWTO] has since published a range of information including Manuals on Accessible Tourism for tourism stakeholders to ensure the quality and quantity of the supply of good accessible tourism practises, and recommendations on Accessible Tourism for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism|title=Accessible Tourism {{!}} Ethics, Culture and Social Responsibility|website=ethics.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research results of the geography of disability intrigue a further studies of universe design of space in relation to the mobility and accessibility, and the improvement of the assistive technologies to confront the barriers encountered by the disabled. The geographical model of disability was created during research of the geography of disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Zajadacz, he stated that: “In recent years, geographers have made significant strides towards understanding the spatially of disability. This research has presented disability as a characteristic of the population that inevitably leads to marginalization and spatial exclusion from otherwise normal social arenas and spaces within the built environment. Geographers claimed that throughout the research on the geography of disability, they connected the cause of disability in terms of social and spatial environment and helped the promotion of more accommodating resolution which “provide access to sites and the full scope of life within society taking different degrees and types of disability into consideration.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gaining the idea of disability from the social model of disability and the geographical model of disability, the definition and the attitude towards Disability no longer limited only to the physical decrement of an individual, but evolve further to the consideration to disabled’s daily experience relating to social and spatial aspects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Discrimination Law and Policy ==
In WHO’s report about the disabling barriers, it said:

“Beliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education, employment, health care, and social participation. For example, the attitudes of teachers, school administrators, other children, and even family members affect the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Misconceptions by employers that people with disabilities are less productive than their non-disabled counterparts, and ignorance about available adjustments to work arrangements limits employment opportunities.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Australia, The ''Disability Discrimination Act 1992(DDA)'' illegitimate any direct or indirect discriminating actions towards a person, either temporarily or permanently disabled, or with the future potential of being disabled, in areas including employment, education, access to services and public places and rights to purchase premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/disability-discrimination|title=Disability discrimination|last=connie.kwan|date=2015-02-18|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Gestational diabetes is formally defined as "any degree of [[glucose intolerance]] with onset or first recognition during pregnancy".&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Metzger | first1 = B. E. | last2 = Coustan | first2 = D. R. | title = Summary and recommendations of the Fourth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.

These two groups are further subdivided according to their associated risks and management.&lt;ref name="OBSTETRICS"&gt;Gabbe S.G., Niebyl J.R., Simpson J.L. OBSTETRICS: Normal and Problem Pregnancies. Fourth edition. Churchill Livingstone, New York, 2002. {{ISBN|0-443-06572-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two subtypes of gestational diabetes under this classification system are: 
* Type A1: abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), but normal blood glucose levels during fasting and two hours after meals; diet modification is sufficient to control glucose levels
* Type A2: abnormal OGTT compounded by abnormal glucose levels during fasting and/or after meals; additional therapy with insulin or other medications is required

[[Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy|Diabetes which existed prior to pregnancy]] is also split up into several subtypes under this system:{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

* Type B: onset at age 20 or older and duration of less than 10 years.
* Type C: onset at age 10–19 or duration of 10–19 years.
* Type D: onset before age 10 or duration greater than 20 years.
* Type E: overt diabetes mellitus with calcified pelvic vessels.
* Type F: [[diabetic nephropathy]].
* Type R: proliferative [[retinopathy]].
* Type RF: [[retinopathy]] and [[nephropathy]].
* Type H: [[ischemic heart disease]].
* Type T: prior kidney transplant.

An early age of onset or long-standing disease comes with greater risks, hence the first three subtypes.{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

About 40–60% of women with GDM have no demonstrable risk factor; for this reason many advocate to screen all women.&lt;ref name=precis&gt;{{cite book|title=Precis V.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:insulin glucose metabolism.jpg|thumbnail|'''Effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism.''' Insulin binds to its receptor (1) on the cell membrane which in turn starts many protein activation cascades (2). These include: translocation of Glut-4 transporter to the [[plasma membrane]] and influx of glucose (3), [[glycogen]] synthesis (4), [[glycolysis]] (5) and [[fatty acid]] synthesis (6).]]
The precise mechanisms underlying gestational diabetes remain unknown. The hallmark of GDM is increased [[insulin resistance]]. Pregnancy hormones and other factors are thought to interfere with the action of insulin as it binds to the [[insulin receptor]]. The interference probably occurs at the level of the [[cell signaling]] pathway beyond the insulin receptor.&lt;ref name="clinicaldiabetes"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carr DB, Gabbe S | year = 1998 | title = Gestational Diabetes: Detection, Management, and Implications | url = http://journal.diabetes.org/clinicaldiabetes/v16n1J-F98/pg4.htm | journal = Clin Diabetes | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | page = 4 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010144040/http://journal.diabetes.org/clinicaldiabetes/v16n1J-F98/pg4.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since insulin promotes the entry of glucose into most cells, insulin resistance prevents glucose from entering the cells properly. As a result, glucose remains in the bloodstream, where glucose levels rise. More insulin is needed to overcome this resistance; about 1.5–2.5 times more insulin is produced than in a normal pregnancy.&lt;ref name="clinicaldiabetes"/&gt;

Insulin resistance is a normal phenomenon emerging in the second trimester of pregnancy, which in cases of GDM progresses thereafter to levels seen in a non-pregnant person with type 2 diabetes. It is thought to secure glucose supply to the growing fetus. Women with GDM have an insulin resistance that they cannot compensate for with increased production in the β-cells of the pancreas. [[Placenta]]l [[hormones]], and to a lesser extent increased [[fat]] deposits during pregnancy, seem to mediate insulin resistance during pregnancy. [[Cortisol]] and [[progesterone]] are the main culprits, but [[human placental lactogen]], [[prolactin]] and [[estradiol]] contribute, too.  Multivariate stepwise regression analysis reveals that, in combination with other placental hormones, leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and resistin are involved in the decrease in insulin sensitivity occurring during pregnancy, with tumor necrosis factor alpha named as the strongest independent predictor of insulin sensitivity in pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} An inverse correlation with the changes in insulin sensitivity from the time before conception through late gestation accounts for about half of the variance in the decrease in insulin sensitivity during gestation: in other words, low levels or alteration of TNF alpha factors corresponds with a greater chance of, or predisposition to, insulin resistance or sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gabbe |first1=Steven G. |title=Obstetrics normal and problem pregnancies |date=2012 |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=9781455733958 |page=890 |edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear why some women are unable to balance insulin needs and develop GDM; however, a number of explanations have been given, similar to those in type 2 diabetes: [[autoimmunity]], single gene [[mutations]], obesity, along with other mechanisms.&lt;ref name="pathophysiology"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buchanan | first1 = T. A. | last2 = Xiang | first2 = A.

Though the clinical presentation of gestational diabetes is well characterized, the biochemical mechanism behind the disease is not well known. One proposed biochemical mechanism involves insulin-producing β-cell adaptation controlled by the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway. β-cell adaption refers to the change that pancreatic islet cells undergo during pregnancy in response to maternal hormones in order to compensate for the increased physiological needs of mother and baby. These changes in the β-cells cause increased insulin secretion as a result of increased β-cell proliferation.&lt;ref name="SorensonBrelje2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorenson|first1=R.|last2=Brelje|first2=T.|title=Adaptation of Islets of Langerhans to Pregnancy: β-Cell Growth, Enhanced Insulin Secretion and the Role of Lactogenic Hormones|journal=Hormone and Metabolic Research|volume=29|issue=06|year=2007|pages=301–307|issn=0018-5043|doi=10.1055/s-2007-979040}}&lt;/ref&gt;
HGF/[[c-MET]] has also been implicated in β-cell regeneration, which suggests that HGF/c-MET may help increase β-cell mass in order to compensate for insulin needs during pregnancy.  Recent studies support that loss of HGF/c-MET signaling results in aberrant β-cell adaptation.&lt;ref name="Alverez-Perez, 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvarez-Perez|first1=J.

c-MET is a [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] (RTK) that is activated by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and is involved in the activation of several cellular processes. When HGF binds c-MET, the receptor homodimerizes and self-phosphorylates to form an SH2 recognition domain. The downstream pathways activated include common signaling molecules such as RAS and MAPK, which affect cell motility, cell motility, and cell cycle progression.&lt;ref name="Organ, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Organ|first1=S. L.|last2=Tsao|first2=M.-S.|title=An overview of the c-MET signaling pathway|journal=Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology|volume=3|issue=1 Suppl|year=2011|pages=S7–S19|issn=1758-8340|doi=10.1177/1758834011422556|pmid=22128289|pmc=3225017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that HGF is an important signaling molecule in stress related situations where more insulin is needed. Pregnancy causes increased insulin resistance and so a higher insulin demand. The β-cells must compensate for this by either increasing insulin production or proliferating. If neither of the processes occur, then markers for gestational diabetes are observed. It has been observed that pregnancy increases HGF levels, showing a correlation that suggests a connection between the signaling pathway and increased insulin needs. In fact, when no signaling is present, gestational diabetes is more likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Alverez-Perez, 2014" /&gt;

The exact mechanism of HGF/c-MET regulated β-cell adaptation is not yet known but there are several hypotheses about how the signaling molecules contribute to insulin levels during pregnancy. c-MET may interact with FoxM1, a molecule important in the cell cycle, as [[FOXM1]] levels decrease when c-MET is not present. Additionally, c-MET may interact with [[p27 (gene)|p27]] as the protein levels increase with c-MET is not present. Another hypothesis says that c-MET may control β-cell apoptosis because a lack of c-MET causes increases cell death but the signaling mechanisms have not been elucidated.&lt;ref name="Alverez-Perez, 2012" /&gt;

Although the mechanism of HGF/c-MET control of gestational diabetes is not yet well understood, there is a strong correlation between the signaling pathway and the inability to produce an adequate amount of insulin during pregnancy and thus it may be the target for future diabetic therapies.&lt;ref name="Alverez-Perez, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alverez-Perez, 2012" /&gt;

Because glucose travels across the placenta (through [[Facilitated diffusion|diffusion facilitated]] by [[GLUT1]] carrier), which is located in the syncytiotrophoblast on both the microvillus and basal membranes, these membranes may be the rate-limiting step in placental glucose transport. There is a two- to three-fold increase in the expression of syncytiotrophoblast glucose transporters with advancing gestation. Finally, the role of GLUT3/GLUT4 transport remains speculative. If the untreated gestational diabetes fetus is exposed to consistently higher glucose levels, this leads to increased fetal levels of [[insulin]] (insulin itself cannot cross the placenta). The growth-stimulating effects of insulin can lead to excessive growth and a large body ([[macrosomia]]). After birth, the high glucose environment disappears, leaving these newborns with ongoing high insulin production and susceptibility to low blood glucose levels ([[hypoglycemia]]).&lt;ref name="controversies"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = L. | last2 = Evans | first2 = L. | last3 = Messenger | first3 = D. | title = Controversies around gestational diabetes.

A number of screening and diagnostic tests have been used to look for high levels of [[glucose]] in [[Blood plasma|plasma]] or [[Blood serum|serum]] in defined circumstances. One method is a stepwise approach where a suspicious result on a screening test is followed by diagnostic test. Alternatively, a more involved diagnostic test can be used directly at the first prenatal visit for a woman with a high-risk pregnancy. (for example in those with [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] or [[acanthosis nigricans]]).&lt;ref name="controversies"/&gt;

Non-challenge blood glucose tests involve measuring glucose levels in blood samples without challenging the subject with glucose solutions. A blood glucose level is determined when fasting, 2 hours after a meal, or simply at any random time. In contrast, challenge tests involve drinking a glucose solution and measuring glucose concentration thereafter in the blood; in diabetes, they tend to remain high. The glucose solution has a very sweet taste which some women find unpleasant; sometimes, therefore, artificial flavours are added. Some women may experience nausea during the test, and more so with higher glucose levels.&lt;ref name="taste"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sievenpiper | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Jenkins | first2 = D.

Some pregnant women and careproviders choose to forgo routine screening due to the absence of risk factors, however this is not advised due to the large proportion of women who develop gestational diabetes despite having no risk factors present and the dangers to the mother and baby if gestational diabetes remains untreated.&lt;ref name=precis /&gt;

===Non-challenge blood glucose tests===
When a plasma glucose level is found to be higher than 126&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (7.0&amp;nbsp;mmol/l) after fasting, or over 200&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (11.1&amp;nbsp;mmol/l) on any occasion, and if this is confirmed on a subsequent day, the diagnosis of GDM is made, and no further testing is required.&lt;ref name="ADA2004"/&gt; These tests are typically performed at the first antenatal visit. They are simple to administer and inexpensive, but have a lower test performance compared to the other tests, with moderate [[Sensitivity and specificity#Sensitivity|sensitivity]], low [[Sensitivity and specificity#Specificity|specificity]] and high [[false positive]] rates.&lt;ref name="FGTreview"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Agarwal | first1 = M.

===Screening glucose challenge test===
The screening glucose challenge test (sometimes called the O'Sullivan test) is performed between 24–28 weeks, and can be seen as a simplified version of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). No previous fasting is required for this screening test,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddeamc.amedd.army.mil/clinical/pathology/DPALSGTT.aspx GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212203107/http://www.ddeamc.amedd.army.mil/clinical/pathology/DPALSGTT.aspx |date=2012-12-12 }} at the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center]]. Last Modified November 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the OGTT. The O'Sullivan test involves drinking a solution containing 50&amp;nbsp;grams of glucose, and measuring blood levels 1 hour later.&lt;ref name=niddk&gt;{{cite web | author=Boyd E. Metzger, M.D., Susan A. Biastre, R.D., L.D.N., C.D.E., Beverly Gardner, R.D., L.D.N., C.D.E. | title=What I need to know about Gestational Diabetes | publisher=National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse | work=National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse | url=http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/gestational/ | year=2006 | accessdate=2006-11-27 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126044339/http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/gestational/ | archivedate=2006-11-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the cut-off point is set at 140&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (7.8&amp;nbsp;mmol/l), 80% of women with GDM will be detected.&lt;ref name="ADA2004"/&gt; If this threshold for further testing is lowered to 130&amp;nbsp;mg/dl,  90% of GDM cases will be detected, but there will also be more women who will be subjected to a consequent OGTT unnecessarily.

===Oral glucose tolerance test===
A standardized [[oral glucose tolerance test]] (OGTT)&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus_preg_glucose"&gt;{{cite web |title=Glucose screening tests during pregnancy |url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007562.htm |website=Medline Plus |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be done in the morning after an overnight fast of between 8 and 14 hours. During the three previous days the subject must have an unrestricted diet (containing at least 150 g [[carbohydrate]] per day) and unlimited physical activity. The subject should remain seated during the test and should not smoke throughout the test.

The test involves drinking a solution containing a certain amount of glucose, usually 75 g or 100 g, and drawing blood to measure glucose levels at the start and on set time intervals thereafter.

The diagnostic criteria from the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) have been used most often, but some centers rely on the Carpenter and Coustan criteria, which set the cutoff for normal at lower values. Compared with the NDDG criteria, the Carpenter and Coustan criteria lead to a diagnosis of gestational diabetes in 54 percent more pregnant women, with an increased cost and no compelling evidence of improved perinatal outcomes.&lt;ref name=NCBI2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Coustan | first2 = D. R. | title = Criteria for screening tests for gestational diabetes | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 144 | issue = 7 | pages = 768–773 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7148898 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(82)90349-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are the values which the [[American Diabetes Association]] considers to be abnormal during the 100 g of glucose OGTT:

* Fasting blood glucose level ≥95&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (5.33&amp;nbsp;mmol/L)
* 1 hour blood glucose level ≥180&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (10&amp;nbsp;mmol/L)
* 2 hour blood glucose level ≥155&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (8.6&amp;nbsp;mmol/L)
* 3 hour blood glucose level ≥140&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (7.8&amp;nbsp;mmol/L)

An alternative test uses a 75 g glucose load and measures the blood glucose levels before and after 1 and 2 hours, using the same reference values. This test will identify fewer women who are at risk, and there is only a weak concordance (agreement rate) between this test and a 3-hour 100 g test.&lt;ref name="comparison"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mello | first1 = G. | last2 = Elena | first2 = P. | last3 = Ognibene | first3 = A. | last4 = Cioni | first4 = R. | last5 = Tondi | first5 = F. | last6 = Pezzati | first6 = P. | last7 = Pratesi | first7 = M. | last8 = Scarselli | first8 = G. | last9 = Messeri | first9 = G. | title = Lack of Concordance between the 75-g and 100-g Glucose Load Tests for the Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 9 | pages = 1679–1684 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16873295 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2005.058040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The glucose values used to detect gestational diabetes were first determined by O'Sullivan and Mahan (1964) in a [[retrospective cohort study]] (using a 100&amp;nbsp;grams of glucose OGTT) designed to detect risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. The values were set using whole blood and required two values reaching or exceeding the value to be positive.&lt;ref name=AMN&gt;{{cite web | title=Gestational Diabetes | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work=Diabetes Mellitus &amp; Pregnancy – Gestational Diabetes | url=http://www.health.am/pregnancy/gestational-diabetes/ | year=2006 | accessdate=2006-11-27 | first1=C. | last1=Janzen | first2=J.S. | last2=Greenspoon | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105021030/http://www.health.am/pregnancy/gestational-diabetes/ | archivedate=2007-01-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent information led to alterations in O'Sullivan's criteria. When methods for blood glucose determination changed from the use of whole blood to venous plasma samples, the criteria for GDM were also changed.

===Urinary glucose testing===
Women with GDM may have high glucose levels in their urine ([[glucosuria]]). Although [[dipstick]] testing is widely practiced, it performs poorly, and discontinuing routine dipstick testing has not been shown to cause underdiagnosis where universal screening is performed.&lt;ref name="routine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhode | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = H. | last3 = Jones Ow | first3 = 3. | title = Indicated vs. Routine prenatal urine chemical reagent strip testing | journal = The Journal of reproductive medicine | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 214–219 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17465289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[glomerular filtration rate]]s during pregnancy contribute to some 50% of women having glucose in their urine on dipstick tests at some point during their pregnancy. The sensitivity of glucosuria for GDM in the first 2 trimesters is only around 10% and the [[positive predictive value]] is around 20%.&lt;ref name="glucosuria"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alto | first1 = W.

Diet and physical activity interventions designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain reduce the rates of gestational diabetes. However, the impact of these interventions varies with the body-mass index of the person as well as with the region in which the studies were performed.&lt;ref name="pmid29698713"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bennett CJ, Walker RE, Blumfield ML, Gwini SM, Ma J, Wang F, Wan Y, Dickinson H, Truby H |title=Interventions designed to reduce excessive gestational weight gain can reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials |journal=Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice |volume=141 |issue= |pages=69–79 |date=July 2018 |pmid=29698713 |doi=10.1016/j.diabres.2018.04.010 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A repeat OGTT should be carried out 6 weeks after delivery, to confirm the diabetes has disappeared. Afterwards, regular screening for type 2 diabetes is advised.&lt;ref name="ACHOISreview"/&gt;

Lifestyle interventions include exercise, diet advice, behavioural interventions, relaxation, self-monitoring glucose, and combined interventions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Julie|last2=Alwan|first2=Nisreen A.|last3=West|first3=Jane|last4=Brown|first4=Stephen|last5=McKinlay|first5=Christopher Jd|last6=Farrar|first6=Diane|last7=Crowther|first7=Caroline A.|date=2017|title=Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of women with gestational diabetes|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|pages=CD011970|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011970.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28472859|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with gestational diabetes who receive lifestyle interventions seem to have less postpartum depression, and were more likely to reach their weight loss targets after giving birth, than women who had no intervention.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Their babies are also less likely to be large for their gestational age, and have less percentage of fat when they are born.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More research is needed to find out which lifestyle interventions are best.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If a [[diabetic diet]] or [[G.I. Diet]], exercise, and oral medication are inadequate to control glucose levels, insulin therapy may become necessary.

The development of macrosomia can be evaluated during pregnancy by using [[obstetric ultrasonography|sonography]].  Women who use insulin, with a history of stillbirth, or with hypertension are managed like women with overt diabetes.&lt;ref name=precis/&gt;

===Lifestyle===
Counselling before pregnancy (for example, about preventive [[folic acid]] supplements) and multidisciplinary management are important for good pregnancy outcomes.&lt;ref name="diabetespregnancy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kapoor | first1 = N. | last2 = Sankaran | first2 = S. | last3 = Hyer | first3 = S. | last4 = Shehata | first4 = H. | title = Diabetes in pregnancy: A review of current evidence | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 586–590 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18007138 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282f20aad }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most women can manage their GDM with dietary changes and exercise.

==Prognosis==
Gestational diabetes generally resolves once the baby is born. Based on different studies, the chances of developing GDM in a second pregnancy, if a woman had GDM in her first pregnancy, are between 30 and 84%, depending on ethnic background. A second pregnancy within 1 year of the previous pregnancy has a large likelihood of GDM recurrence.&lt;ref name="recurrence"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = C. | last2 = Berger | first2 = D.

The two main risks GDM imposes on the baby are growth abnormalities and chemical imbalances after birth, which may require admission to a [[neonatal intensive care unit]]. Infants born to mothers with GDM are at risk of being both [[large for gestational age]] (macrosomic)&lt;ref name="HAPO2008"/&gt; in unmanaged GDM, and [[small for gestational age]] and [[Intrauterine growth retardation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Setji|first=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28746">'''Global Health Initiatives''' ('''GHIs''') are humanitarian initiatives that raise and disburse additional funds for infectious diseases– such as [[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]]– for [[immunization]] and for strengthening health systems in developing countries. GHIs classify a type of global initiative, which is defined as an organized effort integrating the involvement of organizations, individuals, and stakeholders around the world to address a global issue (i.e.: climate change, human rights, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shiffman|first=Jeremy|last2=Smith|first2=Stephanie|date=2007-10-13|title=Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673607615797|journal=The Lancet|volume=370|issue=9595|pages=1370–1379|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61579-7|issn=0140-6736|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of GHIs are the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] (Global Fund), and the [[World Bank]]'s [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTAFRHEANUTPOP/EXTAFRREGTOPHIVAIDS/0,,contentMDK:20415735~menuPK:1001234~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:717148,00.html Multi-country AIDS Programme] (MAP), all of which focus on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].  The [[Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance|Gavi]] (formerly the GAVI Alliance) focuses on immunization, particularly with respect to child survival.

==GHI Functions==
In terms of their institutional structure, GHIs have little in common with each other. In terms of their function – specifically their ability to raise and disburse funds, provide resources and coordinate and/or implement disease control in multiple countries – GHIs share some common ground, even if the mechanisms through which each of these functions is performed are different.&lt;ref&gt;Biesma R., Brugha R., Harmer A., Walsh A., Spicer N. and Walt G.

PEPFAR - an initiative established in 2003 by the Bush Administration - and PEPFAR II (PEPFAR’s successor in 2009 under the Obama Administration&lt;ref&gt;In May 2009, the Obama Administration announced that it would be launching a six-year aid programme called the Global Health Initiative with a commitment of $63bn.&lt;/ref&gt;) are [[bilateralism|bilateral agreements]] between the United States and a recipient of its development aid for HIV/AIDS – typically an international non-government organisation [[INGO]] or a recipient country’s government. The Global Fund, established in 2002, and the GAVI Alliance, launched in 2000, are [[public-private partnerships]] that raise and disburse funds to treat AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and for immunization and vaccines. The [[World Bank]] is an [[International financial institution]]. It is the largest funder of HIV/AIDS within the United Nations system and has a portfolio of HIV/AIDS programmes dating back to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;By way of comparison, UNAIDS' [http://www.unaids.org/en/AboutUNAIDS/UBW/default.asp Unified Workplan 2010/11] has a budget of $US484m over the two-year period. Of this, $US136.4m (the interagency fund), is set aside to pay for country level activities and staff&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Bank launched the first phase of its response to HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa – the Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP).

== Political Economy of GHIs ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=Check for original research, needs more sourcing, general cleanup|date=June 2018}}

The amount of political priority given to Global Health Initiatives varies between national and international governing powers. Though evidence shows that there exists an inequity between resource allocation for initiatives concerning issues such as child immunization, HIV/AIDS, and family planning in comparison to initiatives for high-burden disorders such as malnutrition and pneumonia, the source of this variance is unknown due to lack of systematic research pertaining to this subject. Global political priority is defined as the extent to which national and international political leaders address an issue of international concern through support in the forms of human capital, technology, and/or finances in order to aid efforts to resolve the problem. Global political priority is demonstrated through national and international leaders expressing sustained concern both privately and publicly, political systems and organizations enacting policies to help alleviate the issue, and national and international agencies providing resource levels that reflect the severity of the given crisis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The amount of attention a given global initiative receives is considerably dependent on the power and authority of actors connected to the issue, the power and impact of ideas defining and describing the issue, the power of political contexts framing the environments in which the actors operate to address the issue, as well as the weight and power of issue characteristics indicating the severity of the issue (i.e.: statistical indicators, severity metrics, efficacy of proposed interventions, etc.). Factors including objective measurability, scalability of the issue and proposed interventions, ability to track and monitor progress, risk of perceived harm, as well as simplicity and affordability of proposed solutions all contribute to the degree to which a given global initiative is likely to receive political attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, case studies have shown that the likelihood of global initiatives garnering public and political attention is not limited to the aforementioned factors. For example, initiatives concerning polio eradication continue to receive substantial resources in spite of the relatively small global burden of disease as compared to chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and some communicable diseases such as pneumonia which comparatively attract fewer worldwide resources irrespective of the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with such diseases. These cases highlight the need for extensive research methods and evaluative measures to assess the relative causal weights of factors used to determine how global political priority is attributed to global health initiatives. Existing debates also attribute factors such as the increasing influences of economic globalization, international organizations, and economic actors with little to no previous health remit as each contributing to the evolution of global health governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230249486_1|title=Global Health Governance|last=Kay|first=Adrian|last2=Williams|first2=Owain|date=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|isbn=9781349302284|series=International Political Economy Series|pages=1–23|language=en|doi=10.1057/9780230249486_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of GHIs on Country Health Systems==
There is much discussion about the extent to which the volume of these additional funds creates multiple effects that positively and/or negatively impact both health systems and health outcomes for specific diseases. Assessing the direct impact of GHIs on specific diseases and health systems poses challenges pertaining to the issue of attributing particular effects to individual GHIs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As such, a common response in evaluations of GHIs is to acknowledge the inherent limitations of establishing causal chains in what is a highly complex public health environment, and to base conclusions on adequacy statements resulting from trends that demonstrate substantial growth in process and impact indicators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, existing literature argues that this approach towards evaluating GHIs can inadvertently result in overlooking the impact of social determinants on a disease, as implementers and evaluators are less likely to tackle the complexity of a disease within the larger social, political, cultural, and environmental system. Even if a GHI is effectively evaluated– perhaps showing a decrease in disease prevalence– the challenge remains of comprehensively analyzing the long-term impacts of the GHI by addressing the root social, political, or environmental causes of the disease. Accordingly, existing debates suggest that GHIs should be less concerned with the eradication of specific diseases, and should instead focus primarily on factors– such as basic living conditions, sanitation, and access to nutritious food– that are essential to delivering a sustainable heath program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Paul E.|last2=Nizeye|first2=Bruce|last3=Stulac|first3=Sara|last4=Keshavjee|first4=Salmaan|date=October 2006|title=Structural violence and clinical medicine |journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e449|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 |pmc=1621099|pmid=17076568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on the effects of GHIs==
A small number of institutions have shaped, and continue to shape, research on GHIs.  In 2003, researchers at [http://www.abtassociates.com/ Abt Associates] devised an influential framework for understanding the system-wide effects of the Global fund which has informed much subsequent research, including their own studies of system-wide effects of the Global Fund in Benin, Ethiopia, Georgia and Malawi - often referred to as the 'SWEF' studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalfund.org/documents/library/studies/evaluation_framework/EF1_full.pdf Bennett S. and Fairbank A, The system-wide effects of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria: A conceptual framework, Oct 2003, Partners for Health Reform''plus'' and Abt Associates Inc.] Document summaries and links to each of the SWEF studies are accessible through the [http://ghinet.org/database.asp Global health Initiatives Network database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abt continues to support ongoing research on the effects of GHIs in multiple countries. The Washington-based [[Center for Global Development]] has also been very active in its analysis of GHIs, particularly PEPFAR financing. The Center's [http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/hivmonitor HIV/AIDS Monitor] is essential reading for researchers of GHIs. With hubs in London and Dublin, the [http://ghinet.org/index.asp Global Health Initiatives Network] (GHIN) has been coordinating and supporting research in 22 countries on the effects of GHIs on existing health systems.

Knowledge of the effects of GHIs on specific diseases and on health systems comes from multiple sources.[[Longitudinal studies]] enable researchers to establish baseline data and then track and compare GHI effects on disease control or country health systems over time. In addition to Abt Associates' SWEF studies, additional early examples of this type of analysis were three-year, multi-country studies of the Global Fund in Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=59 Brugha et al (2005) Global Fund Tracking Study: A Cross-country Comparative Analysis, LSHTM, London]. PDFs of each country study is accessible through the [http://ghinet.org/database.asp GHIN database]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, research findings were published from tracking studies in [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_europe_kyrgyzstan.asp Kyrgyzstan], [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_americas_peru.asp Peru] and [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_europe_ukraine.asp Ukraine] that sought to identify the health effects of the Global Fund at national and sub-national levels.

In contrast to longitudinal studies, multi-country analyses of GHIs can provide a ‘snapshot’ of GHI effects but are often constrained by “aggressive timelines”.&lt;ref&gt;Interactions between Global Health Initiatives and Health Systems: Evidence from Countries. The Maximising Positive Synergies Academic Consortium, June 2009, p6.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.who.int/healthsystems/GHIsynergies/en/index.html Maximising Positive Synergies Academic Consortium], for example, reported in 2009 on the effects of the Global Fund and PEPFAR on disease control and health systems, drawing on data from 20 countries.&lt;ref&gt;World health Organisation Maximising Positive Synergies Collaborative Group, An assessment of interactions between global health initiatives and country health systems. Lancet 2009, 373:2137-69&lt;/ref&gt; Most GHI evaluations – both internally and externally commissioned – rely on this type of short-term analysis and, inevitably, there is often a trade-off between depth and breadth of reporting.

Synthesis of data from multiple sources is an invaluable resource for making sense of the effects of GHIs. Early synthesis studies include a 2004 synthesis of findings on the effects of the Global Fund in four countries&lt;ref&gt;Brugha et al (2004) The Global Fund: Managing Great Expectations, Lancet, 364:95-100&lt;/ref&gt; by researchers at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] (LSHTM), a 2005 study by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]]&lt;ref&gt;Global health Partnerships: Assessing Country Consequences, 2005, McKinsey and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; and an assessment of the comparative advantages of the Global Fund and World Bank AIDS programs.&lt;ref&gt;Shakow A. Global Fund and world Bank HIV/AIDS Program: Comparative Advantage Study, 2006, Global Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

Two wide-ranging studies were published in 2009: a study of interactions between GHIs and country health systems commissioned by the World Health Organisation&lt;ref&gt;WHO Maximising Positive Synergies Collaborative Group. An assessment of interactions between global health initiatives and country health systems. The Lancet 373, June 20th pp2137-2169&lt;/ref&gt; and a study by researchers from LSHTM and the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]. The latter study - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=117 The effects of global health initiatives on country health systems: a review of the evidence from HIV/AIDS control] – reviewed the literature on the effects of the Global fund, the World Bank MAP and PEPFAR on country health systems with respect to: 1) national policy; 2) coordination and planning; 3) stakeholder involvement; 4) disbursement, absorptive capacity and management; 5) [[monitoring &amp; evaluation]]; and 6) human resources (Table 2).

==Evaluations of GHIs==
In a comparison between the three largest donors in sponsoring efforts to win the fight against AIDS in Africa, a research study found that PEPFAR performs best in money transfer and data collection; the Global Fund outperforms in tailoring programmatic initiatives and sharing data; and MAP performs highest in collaborating with government systems, strengthening health systems, and helping to build the capacity of local recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Oomman, Nandini, et al. ''Following the Funding for HIV/AIDS: a Comparative Analysis of the Funding Practices of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and World Bank MAP in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia''. Center for Global Development, HIV/AIDS Monitor, 2007, p. xvii, ''Following the Funding for HIV/AIDS: a Comparative Analysis of the Funding Practices of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and World Bank MAP in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia'', www.popline.org/node/199919.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the four GHIs summarized has been evaluated at least once since 2005 and all four produce their own annual reports.

===World Bank MAP===
The primary purpose of the MAP initiative was to introduce a major upscaling of multi-sectoral approach to responding to the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa by involving a multitude of stakeholders including community-based organizations (CBOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), line ministries, and state governments at the highest levels.&lt;ref name="Sophie Harman 2007, pp. 485-492"/&gt;

[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=46 A comprehensive study of MAP programs] published in 2007 reviewed whether MAP was implemented as designed, but did not evaluate MAP or assess its impact. In addition, there have been two evaluations that provide important additional insight into the effectiveness of the Bank's HIV/AIDS programmes (though not specifically MAP focused). In 2005, the Bank conducted an internal evaluation - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=51 Committing to Results: Improving the Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS Assistance] - which found that National AIDS strategies were not always prioritised or costed.

Supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), were weak; civil society had not been engaged; political commitment and capacity had been overestimated, and mechanisms for political mobilisation were weak; and bank research and analysis, whilst perceived to be useful, was not reaching policy makers in Africa.  In 2009, a hard-hitting evaluation of the Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population support – [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTOED/EXTWBASSHEANUTPOP/0,,contentMDK:22153992~menuPK:6080533~pagePK:64829573~piPK:64829550~theSitePK:4422776~isCURL:Y,00.html Improving Effectiveness of Outcomes for the Poor in Health, Nutrition and Population] – found that a third of the Bank’s HNP lending had not performed well, and that while the performance of the Bank’s [[International Finance Corporation]] investments had improved, accountability was weak.

===Global Fund===
Unlike many implementing agencies, the Global Fund has no presence in the countries it supports; rather it is a financial mechanism which provides funding to countries in the form of grants through a Secretariat in Geneva on the competitive basis of country proposals. Special emphasis is placed on proposals demonstrating country ownership as well as those that meet other evidence-based, performance-based, and inclusivity-based criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707263866|title=Handbook of transnational governance : institutions and innovations|date=2011|publisher=Polity|others=Hale, Thomas (Thomas Nathan), Held, David.|isbn=9780745650609|location=Cambridge|oclc=707263866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year, comprehensive evaluation of the Global Fund published a synthesis report in 2009 of findings from three Study areas. The Fund’s Technical Evaluation Research Group (TERG) [http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/terg/evaluations/5year/ Five Year Evaluation] (5YE) of the Global Fund drew on data from 24 countries to evaluate the Fund’s [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=131 organisational effectiveness and efficiency], partnership environment and [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=119 impact on AIDS, TB and Malaria]. The Evaluation highlighted the possible decline in HIV incidence rate in some countries, and rapid scale up of funding for HIV/AIDS, access and coverage, but also identified major gaps in support for national health information systems, and poor drug availability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Macro International Inc. 2009, The Impact of Collective Efforts on the Reduction of Disease Burden, Global Fund FiveYear Evaluation: Study Area 3, Submitted to the Global Fund, Macro International Inc., Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though GHIs have been instrumental in bringing national and international attention to crucial global health issues, existing debates suggest that they can also negatively impact country health systems. As such, disease-specific GHIs such as GAVI have worked to integrate health system strengthening (HSS) measures into programmatic implementation. However, the existing global debate questions the efficacy of HSS programs aimed at targeting technical solutions with clear measurable outcomes versus those more broadly focused on supporting holistic health systems.&lt;ref&gt;Katerini T. Storeng (2014) The GAVI Alliance and the ‘Gates approach’ to health system strengthening, Global Public Health, 9:8, 865-879, DOI: 10.1080/17441692.2014.940362&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an evaluation of GAVI’s vaccine and immunization support - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=124 Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 performance] - reported increased coverage of HepB3, Hib3 and DTP3 and increased coverage in rural areas but also a lack of cost data disaggregated by vaccine that prevented GAVI from accurately evaluating the cost effectiveness of its programs and vaccines, and an “unrealistic” reliance by GAVI on the market to reduce the cost of vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;Chee G., Molldrem V., Hsi N. and Chankova S. (2008) Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 Performance. Abt Associates Inc. p15&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, a study of the financial sustainability of GAVI vaccine support - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=122 Introducing New Vaccines in the Poorest Countries: What did we learn from the GAVI Experience with] - found that although GAVI funding equated to $5 per infant in developing countries per year for the period 2005-10, resource need was accelerating faster than growth in financing.

Findings from two evaluations of GAVI’s support for [[health systems strengthening]] (HSS) were published in 2009. An external evaluation by [http://www.hlsp.org/ HLSP]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=142 GAVI Health Systems Strengthening Support Evaluation: Key Findings and Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt; found insufficient technical support provided to countries applying for GAVI grants, an under-performing Independent Review Committee (IRC), and weaknesses in GAVI’s monitoring of grant activities. The study also found that countries were using GAVI grants for ‘downstream’ short-term HSS fixes rather than ‘upstream’ and long-term structural reform.
A study by [[John Snow, Inc]] praised the multi-year, flexible and country-driven characteristics of GAVI HSS grant funding and encouraged GAVI to continue this support. But also found weak M&amp;E of grant activity, low Civil Society involvement in the HSS proposal development process, unclear proposal writing guidelines, and over-reliance by countries on established development partners for assistance in implementing health system reform.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman B. and Abramson W.

===PEPFAR===
A quantitative study by Stanford University in 2009 – [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=115 The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes] – calculated a 10.5% reduction in the death rate in PEPFAR’s 12 focus countries, equating to 1.2 million lives saved at a cost of $2450 per death averted. In 2007, an evaluation of PEPFAR by the [[Institute of Medicine]] found that PEPFAR had made significant progress in reaching its targets for prevention, treatment and care but also reported that budget allocations "limit the Country Teams ability to harmonize PEPFARs activities with those of the partner government and other donors", and PEPFARs ABC (Abstinence, Be faithful, and correct and consistent Condom use) priorities "fragment the natural continuum of needs and services, often in ways that do not correspond with global standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medicine|first=Institute of|date=2007-09-17|title=PEPFAR Implementation|url=https://doi.org/10.17226/11905|language=en|doi=10.17226/11905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PEPFAR program has brought about substantial impact in its recipient countries. The level of urgency and scale of initiatives led through the PEPFAR program were commensurate with that of the HIV/AIDS epidemic at the time of implementation. Existing debates suggest that the next phase of the program consider placing emphasis on the development of knowledge surrounding HIV/AIDS programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Padian, Nancy|last2=B|first2=Holmes, Charles|last3=I|first3=McCoy, Sandra|last4=Rob|first4=Lyerla,|last5=D|first5=Bouey, Paul|last6=P|first6=Goosby, Eric|title=Implementation Science for the US Presidentʼs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)|url=https://www.academia.edu/33942595/Implementation_Science_for_the_US_President%CA%BCs_Emergency_Plan_for_AIDS_Relief_PEPFAR_|journal=JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes|language=en|volume=56|issue=3|issn=1525-4135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glucose''' (also called '''dextrose''') is a simple [[sugar]] with the [[Chemical formula#Molecular formula|molecular formula]] {{Chemical formula|C|6|H|12|O|6}}. Glucose is the most abundant [[monosaccharide]],&lt;ref name="DombKost1998"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLjhl6AvfIsC&amp;pg=PA275 |isbn=978-1-4200-4936-7 |page=275|title=Handbook of Biodegradable Polymers |last1=Domb |first1=Abraham J. |last2=Kost |first2=Joseph |last3=Wiseman |first3=David |date=1998-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a subcategory of [[carbohydrates]]. Glucose is mainly made by [[plants]] and most [[algae]] during [[photosynthesis]] from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. There it is used to make [[cellulose]] in [[cell wall]]s, which is the most abundant carbohydrate.&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Kamide: ''Cellulose and Cellulose Derivatives''. Elsevier, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-080-45444-3}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[energy metabolism]], glucose is the most important source of energy in all [[organism]]s. Glucose for metabolism is partially stored as a [[polymer]], in plants mainly as [[starch]] and [[amylopectin]] and in animals as [[glycogen]]. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as [[blood sugar]]. The naturally occurring form of glucose is D-glucose, while [[L-glucose]] is produced synthetically in comparably small amounts and is of lesser importance.

Glucose is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1 |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=22 April 2014 |date=October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423005004/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1 |archivedate=23 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name glucose derives through the French from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γλυκός, which means "sweet," in reference to [[must]], the sweet, first press of grapes in the making of [[wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=glucose |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126065057/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=glucose |archivedate=2016-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thénard, Gay-Lussac, Biot, and Dumas (1838) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29662/f106.langEN "Rapport sur un mémoire de M.

==History==
Glucose was first isolated from [[raisin]]s in 1747 by the German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf|Andreas Marggraf]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Food and Health"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Food and Health|date=2015|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123849533|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-t9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA239|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223145046/https://books.google.com/books?id=O-t9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA239|archivedate=2018-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marggraf (1747) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Experiences chimiques faites dans le dessein de tirer un veritable sucre de diverses plantes, qui croissent dans nos contrées"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624083152/https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79 |date=2016-06-24 }} [Chemical experiments made with the intention of extracting real sugar from diverse plants that grow in our lands], ''Histoire de l'académie royale des sciences et belles-lettres de Berlin'', pp. 79–90.

(Raisins, being moistened with a small quantity of water, in a way that they soften, can be then pressed, and the juice that is squeezed out, [after] being purified and thickened, will provide a sort of sugar.)&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose was discovered in grapes by [[Johann Tobias Lowitz]] in 1792 and recognized as different from cane sugar (sucrose). Glucose is the term coined by [[Jean Baptiste Dumas]] in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. [[Friedrich August Kekulé]] proposed the term dextrose (from Latin dexter = right), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, D-fructose (a ketohexose) and L-glucose turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light (''d'' and ''l''-nomenclature) was later abandoned in favor of the D- and L-notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of D- or L-glyceraldehyde.&lt;ref name="Robyt 7"&gt;John F.

Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding of its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in [[organic chemistry]]. This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]], a German chemist who received the 1902 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Emil Fischer | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | publisher = Nobel Foundation | accessdate = 2009-09-02 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090903164859/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | archivedate = 2009-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]'s theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = van't Hoff's Glucose | first = Bert | last = Fraser-Reid | journal = Chem. Eng.

The names initially referred to the natural substances. Their enantiomers were given the same name with the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry (e.g. Fischer nomenclature, D/L nomenclature).

For the discovery of the metabolism of glucose [[Otto Meyerhof]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1922/meyerhof-facts.html "Otto Meyerhof - Facts - NobelPrize.org"].

== Chemical properties ==
With six carbon atoms, it is classed as a [[hexose]], a subcategory of the monosaccharides. &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Glucose is one of the sixteen [[aldohexose]] [[stereoisomer]]s. The &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-[[isomer]], &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer, [[L-glucose|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]], does not. Glucose can be obtained by [[hydrolysis]] of carbohydrates such as milk sugar ([[lactose]]), cane sugar ([[sucrose]]), [[maltose]], [[cellulose]], [[glycogen]], etc. It is commonly commercially manufactured from cornstarch by hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled [[pH]] in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization.&lt;ref&gt;"glucose." The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.. 2015. Encyclopedia.com. 17 Nov. 2015 http://www.encyclopedia.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426025317/http://www.encyclopedia.com/ |date=2009-04-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unbonded glucose is one of the main ingredients of [[honey]]. All forms of glucose are colorless and easily soluble in water, [[acetic acid]], and several other solvents.  They are only sparingly soluble in [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]].

===Structure and nomenclature===
Glucose is a monosaccharide with formula C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or H-(C=O)-(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-H, whose five [[hydroxyl]] (OH) groups are arranged in a specific way along its six-[[carbon]] back. Glucose is usually present in solid form as a [[monohydrate]] with a closed [[pyran]] ring (dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it is has an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as α- or β-[[pyranose]], which partially mutually merge by [[mutarotation]]. From aqueous solutions, the three known forms can be crystallized: α-glucopyranose, β-glucopyranose and β-glucopyranose hydrate.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_457.pub2|chapter=Glucose and Glucose-Containing Syrups|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2006|last1=Schenck|first1=Fred W.|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides [[lactose]] and [[sucrose]] (cane or beet sugar), of [[oligosaccharide]]s such as [[raffinose]] and of polysaccharides such as [[starch]] and [[amylopectin]], [[glycogen]] or [[cellulose]].

===Open-chain form===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|Glucose can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
In its fleeting [[open-chain]] form, the glucose molecule has an open (as opposed to [[cyclic compound|cyclic]]) and unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms, C-1 through C-6; where C-1 is part of an [[aldehyde group]] H(C=O)-, and each of the other five carbons bears one hydroxyl group -OH.  The remaining  [[covalent bond|bonds]] of the backbone carbons are satisfied by [[hydrogen]] atoms -H. Therefore, glucose is both a [[hexose]] and an [[aldose]], or an [[aldohexose]]. The aldehyde group makes glucose a [[reducing sugar]] giving a positive reaction with the [[Fehling test]].

Each of the four carbons C-2 through C-5 is a [[stereocenter]], meaning that its four bonds connect to four different substituents.  (Carbon C-2, for example, connects to -(C=O)H, -OH, -H, and -(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H.)  In &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose, these four parts must be in a specific three-dimensional arrangement. Namely, when the molecule is drawn in the [[Fischer projection]], the hydroxyls on C-2, C-4, and C-5 must be on the right side, while that on C-3 must be on the left side.

The positions of those four hydroxyls are exactly reversed in the Fischer diagram of [[L-Glucose|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]].  &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;- and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose are two of the 16 possible aldohexoses; the other 14 are [[allose]], [[altrose]], [[galactose]], [[gulose]], [[idose]], [[mannose]], and [[talose]], each with two [[enantiomer]]s, “&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-” and “&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-”.

It is important to note that the linear form of glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in a water solution. The rest is one of two cyclic forms of glucose that are formed when the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 (C5) bonds to the aldehyde carbon 1 (C1).

}}
In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either "{{small|D}}-" or "{{small|L}}-") exists in equilibrium with several [[Carbohydrate#Ring-straight chain isomerism|cyclic isomers]], each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution however, more than 99% of glucose molecules, at any given time, exist as [[pyranose]] forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25% and [[furanose]] forms exists in negligible amounts. The terms "glucose" and "{{small|D}}-glucose" are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a [[hemiacetal]] linkage, -C(OH)H-O-.

The reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence "–ose") containing a derivatised [[pyran]] skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether [[furan]].  In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is -(C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)HOH)-H or -(CHOH)-H, respectively).

The ring-closing reaction makes carbon C-1 [[Chirality|chiral]], too, since its four bonds lead to -H, to -OH, to carbon C-2, and to the ring oxygen.  These four parts of the molecule may be arranged around C-1 (the [[anomeric carbon]]) in two distinct ways, designated by the prefixes "α-" and "β-".  When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the [[Haworth projection]], the designation "α-" means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a [[cis-trans isomerism|''trans'']] arrangement), while "β-" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a [[cis-trans isomerism|''cis'']] arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer {{small|D}}-glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: α-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, β-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, α-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose, and β-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid [[catalysis]].

}}
The other open-chain isomer {{small|L}}-glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of {{small|L}}-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding {{small|D}}-glucose.

The rings are not planar, but are twisted in three dimensions. The glucopyranose ring (α or β) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the "chair" and "boat" conformations of [[cyclohexane]].  Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the "envelope" conformations of [[cyclopentane]].

In the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed, forming colorless crystalline solids that are highly [[Solubility|soluble]] in water and [[acetic acid]] but poorly soluble in [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]].  They melt at {{convert|146|C|F}} (''α'') and {{convert|150|C|F}} (''β''), and [[Decomposition|decompose]] at higher temperatures into [[carbon]] and water.

===Rotational isomers===
Each glucose [[isomer]] is subject to [[rotamer|rotational isomerism]]. Within the cyclic form of glucose, rotation may occur around the O6-C6-C5-O5 [[torsion angle]], termed the ''ω''-angle, to form three staggered rotamer conformations called ''gauche''-''gauche'' (gg), ''gauche''-''trans'' (gt) and ''trans''-''gauche'' (tg).&lt;ref&gt;For methyl α-D-glucuopyranose at equilibrium, the ratio of molecules in each rotamer conformation is reported to be  57% gg, 38% gt, and 5% tg. See {{citation | last1 = Kirschner | first1 = Karl N. | last2 = Woods | first2 = Robert J. | title = Solvent interactions determine carbohydrate conformation | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | year = 2001 | volume = 98 | issue = 19 | pages = 10541–45 | pmid = 11526221 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.191362798 | pmc = 58501 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...9810541K }}.{{Primary source inline|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tendency for the ''ω''-angle to adopt a ''gauche'' conformation, a tendency that is attributed to the [[gauche effect]].

===Mutarotation===
[[File:Mutarotation D-Glucose V.1.png|thumb|upright=2|Mutarotation: D-glucose molecules exist as cyclic hemiacetals that are epimeric (= diastereomeric) to each other. The epimeric ratio α:β is 36:64. In the α-D-glucopyranose (left), the blue-labeled hydroxy group is in the axial position at the anomeric center, whereas in the β-D-glucopyranose (right) the blue-labeled hydroxy group is in equatorial position at the anomeric center.]]
Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different -OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the α and β forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium.

The open-chain form is [[Chemical stability|thermodynamically unstable]], and it spontaneously [[isomer]]izes to the cyclic forms.  (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.)  In solutions at [[room temperature]], the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called [[mutarotation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{McMurry2nd | page = 866}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of α:β 36:64.&lt;!--AT ANY TEMPERATURE?--&gt; The ratio would be α:β 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the [[anomeric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Anomeric Effect | last1 = Juaristi | first1 = Eusebio | first2 = Gabriel | last2 = Cuevas | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 9–10 | isbn = 978-0-8493-8941-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to {{convert|0|C}}.

===Optical activity===
Whether in water or in the solid form, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-(+)-glucose is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]], meaning it will rotate the direction of [[polarized light]] clockwise as seen looking toward the light source.  The effect is due to the [[chirality]] of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-(−)-glucose, is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five [[tautomer]]s.

Note that the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;- prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral center has the same handedness as that of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde (which was so labeled because it is dextrorotatory).  The fact that &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centers, not just of C-5; and indeed some of the other &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-aldohexoses are levorotatory.&lt;!--CHECK--&gt;

The conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a [[polarimeter]], since pure α- D- glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, pure β- D- glucose of +17.5 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hesse"&gt;Manfred Hesse, Herbert Meier, Bernd Zeeh, Stefan Bienz, Laurent Bigler, Thomas Fox: ''Spektroskopische Methoden in der organischen Chemie''. 8th revised Edition.

(german)&lt;/ref&gt; When equilibrium has been reached after a certain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hesse" /&gt; By adding acid or base, this transformation is much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain aldehyde form.

===Isomerisation===
In dilute [[sodium hydroxide]] or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides [[mannose]], glucose and [[fructose]] interconvert (via a [[Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation|Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda–van Ekenstein transformation]]), so that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an [[enediol]]:

Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used [[aldohexose]] in most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the [[amine]] groups of [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunn|first1=H.

Glucose's low rate of glycation can be attributed to its having a more stable [[Glucose#Cyclic forms|cyclic form]] compared to other aldohexoses, which means it spends less time than they do in its reactive [[Glucose#Open-chain form|open-chain form]].&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt; The reason for glucose having the most stable cyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its [[Hydroxy group#Hydroxy group|hydroxy groups]] (with the exception of the hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose) are in the [[Cyclohexane conformation|equatorial position]]. Presumably, glucose is the most abundant natural monosaccharide because it is less glycated with proteins than other monosaccharides.&lt;ref name=Higgins /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stryer 531"&gt;Jeremy M. Berg: ''Stryer Biochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2017, {{ISBN|978-3-662-54620-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;531. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that glucose, being the only [[Aldohexose|D-aldohexose]] that has all five [[Hydroxy group|hydroxy]] substituents in the [[Equatorial bond|equatorial]] position in the form of β-D-glucose, is more readily accessible to chemical reactions,&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;Reginald H. Garrett: ''Biochemistry.'' Cengage Learning, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-133-10629-6}}. pp. 194, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, for [[esterification]]&lt;ref name="Voet 363"&gt;Donald Voet, Judith G.

Lehninger, ''Biochemistry, 6th printing'', Worth Publishers Inc. 1972, {{ISBN|0-87901-009-6}} p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, D-glucose is also a highly preferred building block in natural [[polysaccharides]] (glycans). Polysaccharides that are composed solely of Glucose are termed [[glucan]]s.

Glucose is produced by plants through the photosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms as an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and [[chitin]], which are components of the cell wall in plants or [[fungi]] and [[arthropod]]s, respectively. These polymers are degraded to glucose during food intake by animals, fungi and bacteria using enzymes.  All animals are also able to produce glucose themselves from certain precursors as the need arises. [[Nerve cells]], cells of the [[renal medulla]] and [[erythrocytes]] depend on glucose for their energy production.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 195"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;195.

Elsevier Health Sciences, 2014, {{ISBN|978-8-131-23713-7}}. p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt; of which about 4 g are present in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpendo.90563.2008 |pmc=2636990 |pmid=18840763|year=2009 |last1=Wasserman |first1=D.

===Uptake===
Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins [[T1R2]] and [[T1R3]] makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food - about 300 g per day are produced by conversion of food,&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 404"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;404.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also synthesized from other metabolites in the body's cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during [[mastication|chewing]] by means of [[amylase]], which is contained in [[saliva]], as well as by [[maltase]], [[lactase]] and [[sucrase]] on the [[brush border]] of the small intestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. [[Glucosidases]], a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin) and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, [[trehalase]] and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation of glycogen, [[sphingolipids]], [[mucopolysaccharides]] and [[poly(ADP-ribose)]]. Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases and trehalases, but the bacteria in the [[gut flora]] do.

In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins from the [[major facilitator superfamily]].

===Biosynthesis===
{{main|Gluconeogenesis|Glycogenolysis}}
In [[plant]]s and some [[prokaryote]]s, glucose is a product of [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/Photosynthesis.htm|title=Chemistry for Biologists: Photosynthesis|website=www.rsc.org|access-date=2018-02-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804060610/http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/Photosynthesis.htm|archivedate=2016-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucose like [[glycogen]] (in animals and [[mushroom]]s) or [[starch]] (in plants). The cleavage of glycogen is termed [[glycogenolysis]], the cleavage of starch is called starch degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Smith, Alison M. |last2=Zeeman, Samuel C. |last3= Smith, Steven M. |year= 2005 |title= Starch Degradation |journal= Annu.

The metabolic pathway that begins with molecules containing two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six carbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms. The smaller starting materials are the result of other metabolic pathways. Ultimately almost all [[biomolecule]]s come from the assimilation of carbon dioxide in plants during photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Voet 359"&gt;Donald Voet, Judith G.

Bentham Science Publishers, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-608-05189-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in other cell types. In the liver about 150 g of glycogen are stored, in skeletal muscle about 250 g.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 389"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;389. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the glucose released in muscle cells upon cleavage of the glycogen can not be delivered to the circulation because glucose is phosphorylated by the hexokinae, and a glucose-6-phosphatase is not expressed to remove the phosphate group. Unlike for glucose, there is no transport protein for glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build up glucose from other metabolites, including [[lactic acid|lactate]] or certain amino acids, while consuming energy. The renal [[tubular cell]]s can also produce glucose.

If there is not enough oxygen available for this, the glucose degradation in animals occurs anaerobic to lactate via lactic acid fermentation and releases less energy. Muscular lactate enters the liver through the bloodstream in mammals, where gluconeogenesis occurs ([[Cori cycle]]). With a high supply of glucose, the metabolite [[acetyl-CoA]] from the Krebs cycle can also be used for [[fatty acid synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00125-016-3940-5|pmid=27048250|year=2016|last1=Jones|first1=J.

These processes are [[Hormone|hormonally]] regulated.

In other living organisms, other forms of fermentation can occur. The bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' can grow on nutrient media containing glucose as the sole carbon source.&lt;ref name="Voet 59" /&gt; In some bacteria and, in modified form, also in archaea, glucose is degraded via the [[Entner-Doudoroff pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;Entner, N. und Doudoroff, M.

Use of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the [[phosphorylation]] of glucose by a [[hexokinase]] to form [[glucose 6-phosphate]]. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged [[phosphate]] group prevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonadonna|first1=Riccardo C|last2=Bonora|first2=Enzo|last3=Del Prato|first3=Stefano|last4=Saccomani|first4=Maria|last5=Cobelli|first5=Claudio|last6=Natali|first6=Andrea|last7=Frascerra|first7=Silvia|last8=Pecori|first8=Neda|last9=Ferrannini|first9=Eleuterio|last10=Bier|first10=Dennis|last11=DeFronzo|first11=Ralph A|last12=Gulli|first12=Giovanni|title=Roles of glucose transport and glucose phosphorylation in muscle insulin resistance of NIDDM|journal=Diabetes|date=July 1996|volume=45|issue=7|pages=915–25|doi=10.2337/diab.45.7.915|pmid=8666143|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/45/7/915.full-text.pdf|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate group [[Activation#Biochemistry|activates]] glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis. At [[physiological condition]]s, this initial reaction is irreversible.

In anaerobic respiration, one glucose molecule produces a net gain of two ATP molecules (four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis through substrate-level phosphorylation, but two are required by enzymes used during the process).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Medical Biochemistry at a Glance @Google books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA52 | year = 2006 | page = 52 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | isbn = 978-1-4051-1322-9 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180223145046/https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA52 | archivedate = 2018-02-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose is much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules (depending on the organism) through oxidative phosphorylation is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Medical Biochemistry at a Glance  @Google books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA50 | year = 2006 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | page = 50 | isbn = 978-1-4051-1322-9 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180223145046/https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA50 | archivedate = 2018-02-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tumor]] cells often grow comparatively quickly and consume an above-average amount of glucose by glycolysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e32833a5577 |pmid=20473153|year=2010|last1=Annibaldi|first1=A.|title=Glucose metabolism in cancer cells|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|volume=13|issue=4|pages=466–70|last2=Widmann|first2=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to the formation of lactate, the end product of fermentation in mammals, even in the presence of oxygen.

In [[yeast]], ethanol is fermented at high glucose concentrations, even in the presence of oxygen (which normally leads to respiration but not to fermentation). This effect is called the [[Crabtree effect]].

Some glucose is converted to [[lactic acid]] by [[astrocyte]]s, which is then utilized as an energy source by [[brain cells]]; some glucose is used by intestinal cells and [[erythrocytes|red blood cells]], while the rest reaches the [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]] and [[muscle]] cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence of [[insulin]]). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In [[Adipocyte|fat cells]], glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some [[fat]] types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body's "glucose energy storage" mechanism, because it is much more "space efficient" and less reactive than glucose itself.

The [[glycemic index]] is an indicator of the speed of resorption and conversion to blood glucose levels from ingested carbohydrates, measured as the [[area under a curve|area under the curve]] of blood glucose levels after consumption in comparison to glucose (glucose is defined as 100).&lt;ref name="Harvey 366"&gt;Richard A.

The [[glycemic load]] is an indicator for the amount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index and the amount of consumed food.

===Precursor===
Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. [[Starch]], [[cellulose]], and [[glycogen]] ("animal starch") are common glucose [[polymer]]s ([[polysaccharide]]s). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and [[chitin]], which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. [[Oligosaccharide]]s of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include [[lactose]], the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and [[sucrose]], another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and [[fructose]]. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and [[lipid]]s in a process called [[glycosylation]]. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond.

Other than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into [[lipids]]. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C ([[ascorbic acid]]). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various [[metabolic pathway]]s. Among them, all other monosaccharides&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 27"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;27. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; such as fructose (via the [[polyol pathway]]),&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 199"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;199, 200. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; mannose (the epimer of glucose at position 2), galactose (the epimer at position 4), fucose, various [[uronic acids]] and the [[amino sugar]]s are produced from glucose.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 214"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;214. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate, which is part of the glycolysis, glucose can be oxidized during its degradation to [[glucono-1,5-lactone]]. Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building block in the [[trehalose]] or the [[dextran]] biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial [[xylose isomerase]] to fructose. In addition, glucose [[metabolite]]s produce all nonessential [[amino acid]]s, [[sugar alcohol]]s such as [[mannitol]] and [[sorbitol]], [[fatty acid]]s, [[cholesterol]] and [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 27" /&gt; Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the [[glycosylation]] of proteins to [[glycoprotein]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, [[peptidoglycan]]s, [[glycoside]]s and other substances (catalyzed by [[glycosyltransferase]]s) and can be cleaved from them by [[glycosidase]]s.

==Pathology==
===Diabetes===
[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate [[Blood sugar|levels of glucose in the blood]] either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and [[insulin resistance]]. The [[pancreas]] is the organ responsible for the secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Röder PV, Wu B, Liu Y, Han W | title = Pancreatic Regulation of Glucose Homeostasis | journal = Exp. Mol. Med. | volume = 48 | issue = 3, March  | pages = e219– | year = 2016 | pmid =  26964835| doi = 10.1038/emm.2016.6 | pmc = 4892884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions.&lt;ref&gt;Estela, Carlos (2011) "Blood Glucose Levels," Undergraduate Journal of Mathematical Modeling: One + Two: Vol. 3: Iss. 2, Article 12.&lt;/ref&gt; If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the [[beta cell|insulin-producing cells]] in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.

To monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. [[Blood glucose monitoring]] can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) – for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream.

===Overweight and fatty liver===
An increased intake of glucose leads to [[obesity]] and, in consequence, partly to the [[metabolic syndrome]] with [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70032-4 |pmid=24731669|year=2014|last1=Yki-Järvinen|first1=H.|title=Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as a cause and a consequence of metabolic syndrome|journal=The Lancet. Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology|volume=2|issue=11|pages=901–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not the consumption of glucose as part of a normal calorie intake.

===Hypoglycemia management===
[[File:Soluţie glucoză 5%.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Glucose, 5% solution for [[infusion]]s]]
Individuals with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] or other conditions that result in [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms.  One sugar commonly used is glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder), [[hard candy]], or [[sugar packet]].{{clear}}

Most dietary carbohydrates contain glucose, either as their only building block (as in the polysaccharides starch and [[glycogen]]), or together with another monosaccharide (as in the hetero-polysaccharides [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/carbohydrates-and-blood-sugar/|title=Carbohydrates and Blood Sugar|last=|first=|date=2013-08-05|work=|newspaper=The Nutrition Source|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-30|via=Harvard T.H.

==Commercial production==
Glucose is produced industrially from starch by [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[hydrolysis]] using [[glucose amylase]] or by the use of [[acids]]. The enzymatic hydrolysis has largely displaced the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.&lt;ref name="Fellows"&gt;P. J. Fellows: ''Food Processing Technology. Woodhead Publishing'', 2016, {{ISBN|978-0-081-00523-1}}, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is glucose syrup (enzymatically with more than 90% glucose in the dry matter)&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; with an annual worldwide production volume of 20 million tonnes (as of 2011).&lt;ref name="Ullmann 48"&gt;Thomas Becker, Dietmar Breithaupt, Horst Werner Doelle, Armin Fiechter, Günther Schlegel, Sakayu Shimizu, Hideaki Yamada: ''Biotechnology'', in: ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 7th Edition, Wiley-VCH, 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-527-32943-4}}.

Many crops can be used as the source of starch. [[Maize]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; rice,&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; [[wheat]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; [[cassava]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; [[potato]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; [[barley]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; sweet potato,&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;Alan Davidson: ''The Oxford Companion to Food.''

In the [[United States]], [[corn starch]] (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Some commercial glucose occurs as a component of [[invert sugar]], a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and [[fructose]] that is produced from sucrose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolysed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

===Conversion to fructose===
{{main|isoglucose}}
In the USA almost exclusively corn (more precisely: corn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of [[isoglucose]], which is a mixture of glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening power — with same physiological calorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose is eight million tonnes (as of 2011).&lt;ref name="Ullmann 48" /&gt; When made from corn syrup, the final product is [[high fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS).

Glucose is mainly used for the production of fructose and in the production of glucose-containing foods. In foods, it is used as a [[sweetener]], [[humectant]], to increase the [[volume]] and to create a softer [[mouthfeel]].&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; Various sources of glucose, such as grape juice (for wine) or malt (for beer), are used for fermentation to ethanol during the production of [[alcoholic beverage]]s.

==Analysis==
Specifically, when a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger molecule, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography]] analysis or [[lectin]] [[immunostaining]] is performed with [[concanavalin A]] reporter enzyme conjugate (that binds only glucose or mannose).

===Classical qualitative detection reactions===
These reactions have only historical significance:

====Fehling Test====
The [[Fehling test]] is a classic method for the detection of aldoses.&lt;ref name="Fehling-Harn"&gt;H. Fehling: ''Quantitative Bestimmung des Zuckers im Harn.'' In: ''[[Archiv für physiologische Heilkunde]]'' (1848), volume 7, p.&amp;nbsp;64–73. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present to a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I) solution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a [[carboxylic acid]], while the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; tartrate complex is reduced to Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and forming a brick red precipitate (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

====Tollens Test====
In the [[Tollens test]], after addition of ammoniacal [[Silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] to the sample solution, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced by glucose to elemental [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Tollens: [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112025692838;view=1up;seq=535 ''Über ammon-alkalische Silberlösung als Reagens auf Aldehyd'']. In ''[[Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft]]'' (1882), volume 15, p. 1635–1639. (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barfoed test====
In [[Barfoed's test]],&lt;ref name="barfoed"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01462957|title=Ueber die Nachweisung des Traubenzuckers neben Dextrin und verwandten Körpern|journal=Zeitschrift Für Analytische Chemie|volume=12|pages=27–32|year=1873|last1=Barfoed|first1=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a solution of dissolved [[copper acetate]], [[sodium acetate]] and [[acetic acid]] is added to the solution of the sugar to be tested and subsequently heated in a water bath for a few minutes. Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly produce a reddish color and reddish brown [[copper(I) oxide]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

====Nylander's Test====
As a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the [[Nylander's test]].&lt;ref&gt;Emil Nylander: ''Über alkalische Wismuthlösung als Reagens auf Traubenzucker im Harne'', [[Zeitschrift für physiologische Chemie]].

(german)&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] dissolves dry glucose without blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation produces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; Glucose forms a black mass with [[stannous chloride]].&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose (as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal [[lead acetate]] solution, white [[lead glycoside]] is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking and turns brown.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow [[copper oxide]] hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed during boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal [[copper acetate]] solution).&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; With [[Hager's reagent]], glucose forms [[mercury oxide]] during boiling.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; An alkaline [[bismuth]] solution is used to precipitate elemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; Glucose boiled in an [[ammonium molybdate]] solution turns the solution blue. A solution with [[indigo carmine]] and [[sodium carbonate]] destains when boiled with glucose.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt;

===Instrumental Quantification===
====Refractometry and Polarimetry====
In concentrated solutions of glucose with a low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a [[refractometer]], for example in the [[Oechsle scale|Oechsle]] determination in the course of the production of wine.

====Photometric enzymatic methods in solution====
{{main|Glucose oxidation reaction}}
The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/000456326900600108|title=Determination of Glucose in Blood Using Glucose Oxidase with an Alternative Oxygen Acceptor|journal=Annals of Clinical Biochemistry: An International Journal of Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine|volume=6|pages=24–27|year=1969|last1=Trinder|first1=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[phenol]] with [[4-Aminoantipyrine|4-aminoantipyrine]] to a purple dye.

====Photometric Test Strip Method====
The test strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510&amp;nbsp;nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows for routine blood sugar determination by laymen. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550&amp;nbsp;nm, 750&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1039/A709038B|title=Water-soluble chromogenic reagent for colorimetric detection of hydrogen peroxide—an alternative to 4-aminoantipyrine working at a long wavelength|journal=Analytical Communications|volume=35|issue=2|pages=71–74|year=1998|last1=Mizoguchi|first1=Makoto|last2=Ishiyama|first2=Munetaka|last3=Shiga|first3=Masanobu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amperometric glucose sensor====
The electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically quantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=18154363|year=2008|last1=Wang|first1=J.|title=Electrochemical glucose biosensors|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=108|issue=2|pages=814–25|doi=10.1021/cr068123a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The GOx is immobilised on the electrode surface or in a membrane placed close to the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are used in electrodes, as well as carbon nanotube electrodes, which e.g. are doped with boron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2008.04.023 |pmid=18656655|year=2008|last1=Chen|first1=X.|title=Amperometric glucose biosensor based on boron-doped carbon nanotubes modified electrode|journal=Talanta|volume=76|issue=4|pages=763–7|last2=Chen|first2=J.|last3=Deng|first3=C.|last4=Xiao|first4=C.|last5=Yang|first5=Y.|last6=Nie|first6=Z.|last7=Yao|first7=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cu-CuO nanowires are also used as enzyme-free amperometric electrodes. This way a detection limit of 50 µmol/L has been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00604-009-0260-1|title=Enzyme-free amperometric sensing of glucose using Cu-CuO nanowire composites|journal=Microchimica Acta|volume=168|pages=87–92|year=2010|last1=Wang|first1=Guangfeng|last2=Wei|first2=Yan|last3=Zhang|first3=Wei|last4=Zhang|first4=Xiaojun|last5=Fang|first5=Bin|last6=Wang|first6=Lun}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly promising method is the so-called "enzyme wiring". In this case, the electron flowing during the oxidation is transferred directly from the enzyme via a molecular wire to the electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/ac00087a008 |pmid=8092486|year=1994|last1=Ohara|first1=T. J.|title="Wired" enzyme electrodes for amperometric determination of glucose or lactate in the presence of interfering substances|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=66|issue=15|pages=2451–7|last2=Rajagopalan|first2=R.|last3=Heller|first3=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other sensory methods====
There are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose.&lt;ref name="Borisov"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/cr068105t |pmid=18229952|year=2008|last1=Borisov|first1=S. M.|title=Optical biosensors|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=108|issue=2|pages=423–61|last2=Wolfbeis|first2=O. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/193229681100500507 |pmc=3208862 |pmid=22027299|year=2011 |last1=Ferri |first1=S. |title=Review of glucose oxidases and glucose dehydrogenases: A bird's eye view of glucose sensing enzymes |journal=Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=1068–76 |last2=Kojima |first2=K. |last3=Sode |first3=K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the importance of glucose analysis in the life sciences, numerous optical probes have also been developed for saccharides based on the use of boronic acids,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00604-008-0947-8|title=Boronic acid based probes for microdetermination of saccharides and glycosylated biomolecules|journal=Microchimica Acta|volume=162|pages=1–34|year=2008|last1=Mader|first1=Heike S.|last2=Wolfbeis|first2=Otto S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are particularly useful for intracellular sensory applications where other (optical) methods are not or only conditionally usable. In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives, which often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also other probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding proteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which indirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolised products, e.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0956-5663(99)00073-1|title=Sol–gel based glucose biosensors employing optical oxygen transducers, and a method for compensating for variable oxygen background|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|volume=15|pages=69–76|year=2000|last1=Wolfbeis|first1=Otto S.|last2=Oehme|first2=Ines|last3=Papkovskaya|first3=Natalya|last4=Klimant|first4=Ingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that use the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters.&lt;ref name="Borisov" /&gt;

====Copper iodometry====
Glucose can be quantified by copper iodometry.&lt;ref name="Galant"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.071 |pmid=26041177|year=2015|last1=Galant|first1=A. L.|title=Glucose: Detection and analysis|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=188|pages=149–60|last2=Kaufman|first2=R. C.|last3=Wilson|first3=J. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromatographic methods===
In particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey, chromatographic methods such as [[high performance liquid chromatography]] and [[gas chromatography]]&lt;ref name="Galant" /&gt; are often used in combination with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Sanz, J. Sanz, I. Martínez-Castro: ''Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of disaccharides and trisaccharides in honey.'' In: ''[[Journal of Chromatography A]]'', volume 1059, issue 1–2, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;143–148; {{PMID|15628134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mpg-210190"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glucose mass spectrum|periodical=Golm Metabolome Database|publisher=|url=http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/Spectrums/8dee81a1-8d98-4a73-b55d-9de42f10e190.aspx|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-06-04|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=[[Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology]] in Golm Database|date=2007-07-19|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account the isotope ratios, it is also possible to reliably detect honey adulteration by added sugars with these methods.&lt;ref&gt;A. I. Cabañero, J. L. Recio, M. Rupérez: ''Liquid chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry: a new perspective on honey adulteration detection.'' In: ''[[J Agric Food Chem]].'' 54(26), 27 December 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;9719–9727; {{PMID|17177492}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Derivatisation using silylation reagents is commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=24054643|year=2013|last1=Becker|first1=M.|title=Ethoximation-silylation approach for mono- and disaccharide analysis and characterization of their identification parameters by GC/MS|journal=Talanta|volume=115|pages=642–51|last2=Liebner|first2=F.|last3=Rosenau|first3=T.|last4=Potthast|first4=A.|doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2013.05.052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the proportions of di- and trisaccharides can be quantified.

====In vivo analysis====
Glucose uptake in cells of organisms is measured with [[2-deoxy-D-glucose]] or [[fluorodeoxyglucose]].&lt;ref name="Dwyer"&gt;Donard Dwyer: ''Glucose Metabolism in the Brain.'' Academic Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-123-66852-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F)fluorodeoxyglucose is used as a tracer in [[positron emission tomography]] in oncology and neurology,&lt;ref name="gdch"&gt;[[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker]]: [http://www.gdch.de/strukturen/fg/nuklear/posi2.pdf   wayback=20100331071121 ''Anlagen zum Positionspapier der Fachgruppe Nuklearchemie''], February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; where it is by far the most commonly used diagnostic agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1155/2014/214748 |pmc=4058687 |pmid=24991541|year=2014 |last1=Maschauer |first1=S. |title=Sweetening pharmaceutical radiochemistry by (18)f-fluoroglycosylation: A short review |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2014 |pages=1–16 |last2=Prante |first2=O. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since reports of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) began to emerge in the [[United States]] in the 1980s, the HIV epidemic has frequently been linked to [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and other [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) by epidemiologists and medical professionals. The first official report on the virus was published by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) on June 5, 1981 and detailed the cases of five young gay men who were hospitalised with serious infections.&lt;ref&gt;CDC (1981, 5th June) 'Pheumocystis Pneumonia - Los Angeles', MMWR, Vol. 30.                        No. 21. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/june_5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, The New York Times reported that 41 homosexuals had been diagnosed with [[Kaposi’s Sarcoma]], and eight had died less than 24 months after the diagnosis was made.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times (1981, 3rd July) "Rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals" https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html?&amp;pagewanted=2&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, the condition was referred to in the medical community as ([[Gay-related immune deficiency]] (GRID), "gay cancer," and "gay compromise syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, G.A, et al (1982) 'Attempted immune stimulation in the "gay compromise syndrome"'. BMJ, 1982 October 16; 285(6348): 1082.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until July 1982 that the term [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) was suggested to replace GRID,&lt;ref&gt;Grmek, M.D. (1990) 'History of AIDS: Emergence and origin of a modern pandemic', New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and even then it was not until September that the CDC first used the AIDS acronym in an official report.&lt;ref&gt;MMWR Weekly (1982) 'Current Trends Update on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) – United States', September 24, 31(37); 507-508, 513-514.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now well understood that HIV does not only affect the [[gay community]] but can also infect anybody, regardless of sex, ethnicity, or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 AIDS epidemic update |publisher=Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011837/http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, HIV still severely affects MSM across the globe.  MSM are only a small percentage of the U.S. population, but they are consistently the population group most affected by the HIV/AIDS virus and are the largest proportion of American citizens with an AIDS diagnosis who have died.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"&gt;Center for Disease Control. “HIV among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)” (2010). Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimates that 2 to 20% of MSM are infected with HIV, depending on the region they live in.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"&gt;Men who have sex with men, HIV prevention and care” Geneva, November 2005. UNAIDS. http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/jc1233-msm-meetingreport_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Men who have sex with men}}
Men who have sex with men (abbreviated as '''MSM''', also known as '''males who have sex with males''') are [[male|male person]]s who engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex, regardless of how they personally identify themselves. Many MSM choose not to (or cannot for other reasons) identify as [[homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men |publisher=UNAIDS |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320001221/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the label excludes men who identify as gay or bisexual, but who have never had sex with another man, including many gay teenagers.

The terms MSM and women who have sex with women (WSW) have been used in medical scholarship since at least 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Rebecca M. and Ilan H. Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and "WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt; But, the term has been attributed to Glick ''et al.'', because their usage in a 1994 study solidified the concept in medical terminology.&lt;ref name="Young Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young RM, Meyer IH |title=The trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": erasure of the sexual-minority person in public health discourse |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1144–1149 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15961753 |pmc=1449332 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046714 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick M, Muzyka BC, Salkin LM, Lurie D |title=Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of AIDS |journal=J.

Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and “WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
Determining the number of men who have ever had sex with another man is difficult worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 3% and as high as 16% of men have had sex at least once with a man. Their estimate includes victims of sexual abuse in addition to men who regularly or voluntarily have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

UNAIDS. http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/jc1233-msm-meetingreport_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates about the U.S. population of MSM vary. The Center for Disease Control estimates that men who have sex with men represent about 2% of the American population.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; A 2005 study estimates that among U.S. men aged 15 to 44, an estimated 6% of have engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at some point in their lives, and about 2.9% have had at least one male partner in the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Of these men, 71% are White, 15.9% are Hispanic, and 8.9% are black. The percentage of men who were MSM varied by state, with the lowest percentage in South Dakota (3.3%) and the highest in the District of Columbia (13.2%).  However, the same study found that 57% of men who have sex with men identify as bisexual or straight.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, S., Fallon, S., Friedman, S., Thompson, D., Gates, G., Liberti, T., &amp; Malow, R.

==HIV infection rates==

The HIV virus affects the human [[immune system]] and, if left untreated can eventually lead to [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS).&lt;ref name="pmid11396444"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sepkowitz KA |title=AIDS—the first 20 years |journal=N.

The CDC reported  that in 2009 that male-to-male sex (MSM)  accounted for 61% of all new HIV infections in the U.S. and that those who had a history of recreational [[drug injection]] accounted for an additional 3% of new infections. Among the approximately 784,701 people living with an HIV diagnosis, 396,810 (51%) were MSM. About 48% of MSM living with an HIV diagnosis were white, 30% were black, and 19% were Hispanic or Latino. Although the majority of MSM are white,  non-whites accounted for 54% of new infections HIV related MSM infections in 2008.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt;

In 2010  the CDC reported that MSM represented approximately 4 percent of the male population in the United States but male-to-male sex accounted for 78 percent  of new HIV infections among men and 63 percent of all new infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECEMBER 2012 2 HIV Infections by Route  of Transmission|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2012/hiv-infections-2007-2010.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men overall accounted for 76% of all adults and adolescents living with HIV infection at the end of 2010 in the United States, and 80% (38,000) of the estimated 47,500 new HIV infections.  69% of men  living with HIV were gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.  39% (14,700) of new HIV infections in US men were in blacks, 35% (13,200) were in whites, and 22% (8,500) were in Hispanics/Latinos.  The rate of estimated new HIV infections among black men (per 100,000) was 103.6—six and a half times that of white men (15.8) and more than twice the rate among Hispanic/Latino men (45.5) as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among Men in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/men/index.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC (2015) reported  that gay and bisexual men accounted for 82% (26,375 out of 1,242,000 adults and adolescents) of HIV diagnoses among males and 67% of all diagnoses in the United States, while six percent (2,392) of HIV diagnoses were attributed to injection drug use (IDU) and another 3% (1,202) to male-to-male sexual contact plus IDU.  Heterosexual contact accounted for 24% (9,339) of all HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV in the United States: At A Glance|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all gay and bisexual men with HIV infection classified as AIDS in the United States in 2015, African Americans accounted for the highest number (3,928; 39%), followed by whites (3,096; 31%) and Hispanics/Latinos (2,430; 24%). At the end of 2014, 508,676 gay and bisexual men were living with diagnosed HIV infection (53% of everyone living with diagnosed HIV in the US). Of gay and bisexual men living with diagnosed HIV, 157,758 (31%) were African American, 212,558 (42%) were white, and 109,857 (22%) were Hispanic/Latino. From 2005 to 2014 diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men increased 22% but has increased less than 1% between 2010 and 2014. HIV diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 increased 87% between 2005 and 2014, but with diagnoses declining 2% between 2010 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among African American Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/bmsm.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2010 study estimated that for every 100,000 MSM, 692 will be diagnosed with HIV. This makes MSM 60 times more likely to contract the virus than other men and 54 times more likely than women.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, D.W., C Johnson, A Lansky, J Prejean, R Stein, P Denning, Z Gaul, H Weinstock, J Su, &amp; N Crepaz.

Since its height in 1993-1994 the death rate due to HIV  has fallen more than 9 other leading causes of death, yet as of 2013 HIV continues to be one of the 10  leading causes of death among persons 25-44, especially among men, African Americans and in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortality Slide Series|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/slidesets/cdc-hiv-epa5-mortality-slides-2013.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also as regards HIV relation to mortality, a study  in the [[United Kingdom]]   reported that in 2008 the overall mortality rate among the HIV-diagnosed  population aged 15–59 years remained more than five times higher than that in the general population. However, as the study acknowledges  data  on  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  on  mortality among  gay and bisexual men as well as  among other populations, is very limited, and  methods to use  this are  problematic.&lt;ref name="wiley.com"&gt;Wiley Online Library: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12045/pdf Ten-year mortality trends among persons diagnosed with HIV infection in England and Wales in the era of antiretroviral therapy: AIDS remains a silent killer - Simmons - 2013 - HIV Medicine - Wiley Online Library], accessdate: April 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
A 2007 study analyzing two large population surveys found that "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women."&lt;ref name=MedicalNews&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/82330.php Sexual Behavior Does Not Explain Varying HIV Rates Among Gay And Straight Men]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodreau SM, Golden MR |title=Biological and demographic causes of high HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevalence in men who have sex with men |journal=Sex Transm Infect |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=458–462 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17855487 |pmc=2598698 |doi=10.1136/sti.2007.025627}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2006 study found that men who reported 4 or more male sexual partners were at increased risk of HIV infection. Study participants who reported amphetamine or heavy alcohol use before sex were more likely to have HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"&gt;BA Koblin. “Risk factors for HIV infection among men who have sex with men” (2006) AIDS, 20. 731-739.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kaiser Family Foundation study indicated that fewer Americans view HIV as a top health priority today compared to ten years ago. In 1996, 25% of Americans viewed HIV as an “urgent problem” to their community but in 2009, only 17% listed it as “urgent.” The percentage of 18- to 29-year-olds that were personally concerned about contracting the virus dropped from 28% in 1995 to 17% in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation. (2009) “2009 Survey of Americans on HIV/AIDS: summary of findings on the domestic epidemic.”&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 6 major U.S. cities found that only one in 4 teenage men who have sex with men believed they were personally at risk for contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref&gt;MacKellar DA, Valleroy LA, Secura GM, et al. (2007) Perceptions of lifetime risk and actual risk for acquiring HIV among young men who have sex with men. AIDS Behav:263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unprotected anal intercourse===

The HIV virus is more easily transmitted through unprotected [[anal intercourse]] than through unprotected [[vaginal intercourse]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.avert.org/men-sex-men.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and men who report unprotected receptive anal intercourse are at increased risk of contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"/&gt; Generally, the receptive partner is at greater risk of contracting the HIV virus because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body through semen exchange. The insertive partner is also at risk because STIs can enter through the [[urethra]] or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa22.htm Center for Disease Control; "Can I get HIV from anal sex?"]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study of HIV positive men found men who had unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the past year were put at risk for contracting the virus. The study found that men who reported engaging in UAI had increased from 30% in 1996 to 42% in 2000. Almost half of all men who participated in UAI in 1996-1997 said that they had not known the HIV status of their partner &lt;ref&gt;Dodds, J.P., D.E. Mercey, J.V. Parry &amp; A.M. Johnson. (2004) Increasing risk behaviour and high levels of undiagnosed HIV infection in a community sample of homosexual men. Sex Transm Infect; 80:236-240&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that risk factors for HIV infection are anal intercourse with a man in the past 12 months, having unstable housing, and having inhaled [[alkyl nitrites]] (“poppers”).&lt;ref&gt;Mimiaga, M., Reisner, S., Cranston, K., Isenberg, D., Bright, D., Daffin, G., Bland, S., &amp; Driscoll, M. (2009). Sexual mixing patterns and partner characteristics of black msm in Massachusetts at increased risk for HIV infection and transmission. Journal of Urban Health, 86(4), 602-623.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study on the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM found that majority protected their partners during sexual activity, but a sizeable number of men continue to engage in sexual behaviors that place themselves and others at risk for HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;Crepaz, Nicole, Marks, Gary; Liau, Adrian; Mullins, Mary M; Aupont, Latrina W; Marshall, Khiya J; Jacobs, Elizabeth D; Wolitski, Richard J; (2009) “Prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM in the United States: a meta-analysis”, AIDS, 80, 23:1617-1629&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condom fatigue===
Although HIV transmission rates fell throughout the 1990s, they hit a plateau at the end of the decade. The increasing rates of sexually transmitted diseases in major cities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom led to reports in the gay and mainstream media of [[condom fatigue]] and "AIDS optimism" as causes of the new "laxness" in safe sex practices.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"&gt;Adam, Barry D., Winston Husbands, James Murray, and John Maxwell. (2005): AIDS optimism, condom fatigue, or self-esteem? Explaining unsafe sex among gay and bisexual men, Journal of Sex Research, 42:3, 238-248&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by research on the tendency of couples (heterosexual or homosexual) to use [[condoms]] less over time.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, P., Miller, L., &amp; Rothspan, S. (1999). The paradox of trust for male couples. Personal Relationships, 6, 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bochow, M. (1998). The importance of contextualizing research. In M. Wright, B. R. S.

Interpretations of condom use and nonuse among young Norwegian gay men. Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 15(1), 58-83.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2010 study found that gay and bisexual men choose to have unprotected sex for a variety of reasons and cannot be generalized. [[Erectile dysfunction]], mental health problems and [[Mood disorder|depression]], lack of communication or intimacy, and a [[subculture]] of unprotected sex were all listed as reasons why men had sex without condoms voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"/&gt;

==Prevention==
In the late 1980s the first direct advocacy groups for people with HIV/AIDS were created. Notably, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ([[ACT UP]]) formed at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center]] in New York in the wake of the antiretroviral drug [[Zidovudine|AZT]] to petition better access to drugs as well as cheaper prices, public education about AIDS and the prohibition of AIDS-related discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History - 1988, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published a paper in 2005 offering specific policy solutions for alleviating the spread of the HIV virus in the MSM population for specific regions around the world. They pointed to “a profound lack of knowledge” and stigma about sexual identity as worldwide barriers to preventing transmission and encouraging those infected to seek treatment. The UNAIDS program has recommended that the South African government implement “sex positive” policies to reduce societal stigma around homosexuality and promote the use of water-based lubricants. Particularly in Morocco, the program has advocated distributing condoms in prisons. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to acknowledge the sexuality of its constituents. According to UNAIDS, the “Government has made significant progress in recognizing the issue of male-to-male sexual health and HIV.” In Latin America, outreach to rural areas is critical to ensuring care to all individuals. The United Nations also emphasizes a focus on LGBT populations that are most vulnerable in Latin American nations. In Jamaica, as in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is outlawed so there are unique challenges to HIV prevention in the MSM community. The UN is trying to implement community-based strategies in Jamaica while still ensuring the anonymity of the people served. In Norway, UNAIDS has observed an increasing number of MSM who have untreated sexually transmitted infections, and their emphasis is on promoting condom use within the gay community. Despite Canada’s “liberal and progressive” reputation on the world stage, HIV-related stigma is still related to the gay community. The United Nations believes the United States needs to recognize [[sexual education]] as a fundamental human right. Additionally, better research on MSM in the U.S. would positively affect funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Geneva 2005"/&gt;

Studies have shown that although there is a large market for vaginal microbicides in developing nations, rectal microbicides are stigmatized and less researched. No microbicide has yet been proven to effectively protect against the risks of unprotected anal intercourses, but advocates believe greater funding for research is needed since condom usage rates are so low. However, stigma and homophobia would potentially be barriers to individuals buying the product. The authors mention this is especially a concern in Caribbean countries where HIV prevalence is high but homosexuality is still illegal and highly stigmatized (See [[HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean]].) &lt;ref&gt;

===Access to testing===
UNAIDS has observed “sero-selection” (choosing a partner based on their HIV status) becoming increasingly prevalent in partner choice and transmission in the United States.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"/&gt; A 2008 CDC study found that one in five (19%) of MSM in major U.S. cities were infected with HIV and almost half (44%) were unaware of their infection.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; Many HIV-infected individuals do not seek treatment until late in their infection (an estimated 42% do not seek treatment until they begin to experience signs of illness.) Furthermore, a significant portion of individuals who are tested for HIV never return for their test results. Studies have advocated for funding and implementation of HIV tests that can be administered outside medical settings since 2003. Home testing is considered especially important because 8%-39% of partners tested in studies of partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) were found to have a previously undiagnosed HIV infection that their partner was unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Janssen, M.D., I. M. Onorato, M.D., R. O. Valdiserri, M.D., T. M. Durham, M.S., W. P. Nichols, M.P.A., E. M. Seiler, M.P.A., H. W. Jaffe, M.D. “Advancing HIV Prevention: New Strategies for a Changing Epidemic -- United States, 2003” (2003) The Body Pro: HIV Resource for Health Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, OraQuick, the first rapid HIV home-testing kit, went on sale for $40. The test is nearly 100% accurate when it predicts HIV-negative results for HIV-negative individuals. However, for HIV-positive individuals that are not yet producing the antibodies detected by the test, it produces a false negative 93% of the time. Although the manufacturer, OraSure Technologies, is not advertising the test for use for selection of partners,  experts have suggested that it may prevent unprotected sexual contact with partners that lie about or are unaware of their HIV status.&lt;ref name="Donald G. 2012"&gt;McNeil Jr., Donald G. “Another Use for Rapid Home H.I.V. Test: Screening Sexual Partners.” The New York Times. October 5th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study examined how the OraQuick test would identify the behavior of 27 self-identified gay men who frequently had unprotected sex with acquaintances. The researchers gave each participant 16 tests to use over the course of three months. 101 potential partners were tested, and 10 were positive. None of the participants had sex with someone who tested positive.  23 other potential partners refused testing and left the encounter. 2 men admitted they were HIV-positive. Most participants said they would continue using home tests after the study ended to test potential partners on their own. The researchers considered home testing to be an effective prevention method for high-risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo-Dieguez, Alex, Timothy Frasca, Ivan Balan, Mobolaji Ibitoye, and Curtis Dolezal. “Use of a Rapid HIV Home Test Prevents HIV Exposure in a High Risk Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men.” AIDS and Behavior. Volume 16, Number 7 (2012), 1753-1760.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the test’s $40 cost is considered a major deterrent to commonplace partner testing.

'''Healing environment''', for [[healthcare]] buildings describes a physical setting and [[organizational culture]] that supports [[patient]]s and families through the [[stress (medicine)|stresses]] imposed by illness, hospitalization, medical visits, the process of healing, and sometimes, bereavement. The concept implies that the physical healthcare environment can make a difference in how quickly the patient recovers from or adapts to specific acute and chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stichler | first1 = J.F. | year = 2001 | title = Creating healing environments in critical care units | url = | journal = Critical Care Nursing Quarterly | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1097/00002727-200111000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The original concept of the healing environment was developed by [[Florence Nightingale]] whose theory of nursing called for nurses to manipulate the environment to be therapeutic (Nightingale, F. 1859).&lt;ref name="notes on nursing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on Nursing|year=1859|publisher=public domain|location=Gutenberg Project|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12439}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nightingale outlined in detail the requirements of the "sick room" to minimize suffering and optimize the capacity of a patient to recover, including quiet, warmth, clean air, light, and good diet. Early healthcare design followed her theories outlined in her treatise, "Notes on Hospitals.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on Hospitals|year=1860|publisher=Public Domain|location=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Notes_on_hospitals.html?id=k_w5uPm0D-cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the discoveries by Louis Pasteur and others which lead to the Germ Theory, plus other technologies, the role of the environment was dominated by infection control and technological advances.

Starting in the 1960s, healing environments have been linked with [[Evidence-based design]] (EBD), giving the concept a strong scientific base. While in some respects it can be said that the concept of healing environments has evolved into EBD, it’s mainly in the area of reduction of stress that this overlap occurs; as EBD goes beyond the healing environments dimension to consider the effect of the built environment on patient clinical outcomes in the areas of staff stress and fatigue, patient stress, and facility operational efficiency and productivity to improve quality and
patient safety. A 1984 study by Roger Ulrich found that surgical patients with a view of nature suffered fewer complications, used less pain medication and were discharged sooner than those who looked out on a brick wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=R.S.|title=View through a window may influence recovery from surgery|year=1984|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roger_Ulrich4/publication/17043718_View_through_a_window_may_influence_recovery_from_surgery/links/00b4953a3febc6e176000000.pdf|journal=Science|volume=224|pages=420–421|doi=10.1126/science.6143402|pmid=6143402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many studies have followed, showing impact of several environmental factors on several health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Dijkstra|first=K.|title=Understanding healing environments: Effects of physical environmental stimuli on patients' health and well-being|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/60753/1/thesis_K_Dijkstra.pdf|author= |date= |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the philosophy that guides the concept of the healing environment is rooted in research in the [[neuroscience]]s, [[environmental psychology]], [[psychoneuroimmunology]], and [[evolutionary biology]]. The common thread linking these bodies of research is the physiological effects of stress on the individual and the ability to heal. Psychologically supportive environments enable patients and families to cope with and transcend illness.

== Goal ==

The goal of creating a healing environment is to reduce stress, and thereby reduce associated problems such as medical error, inability to concentrate, and physical symptoms of stress that can affect logical thought process. While use of EBD techniques would not necessarily make an environment a healing one, through EBD we can define environmental factors that can help to ease stress and thereby result in a healing environment. Malkin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Malkin J|date=2008|title=A visual reference for evidence-based design.|url=|journal=Center for Health Design}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the contribution of research to concepts that can create a healing environment, but just the inclusion do not make setting a 'healing environment'. The design team needs to translate the [[Evidence-based design|EBD]] into design solutions unique to the individual hospital. 

According to "The Business Case for Creating a Healing Environment" written by Jain Malkin, the physical setting has the potential to be therapeutic if it achieves the following:
* eliminates environmental stressors such as noise, glare, lack of privacy and poor air quality;
* connects patients to nature with views to the outdoors, interior gardens, aquariums, water elements, etc.;
* offers options and choices to enhance feelings of being in control - these may include privacy versus socialization, lighting levels, type of music, seating options, quiet versus 'active' waiting areas;
* provides opportunities for social support - seating arrangements that provide privacy for family groupings, accommodation for family members or friends in treatment setting; sleep-over accommodation in patient rooms;
* provides positive distractions such as interactive art, fireplaces, aquariums, Internet connection, music, access to special video programmes with soothing images of nature accompanied by music developed specifically for the healthcare setting; and
* engenders feelings of peace, hope, reflection and spiritual connection and provides opportunities for relaxation, education, humour and whimsy.

== Bringing Home to the Hospital ==

The most important thing for inpatients at hospitals is the comfort and normalcy of having family members and friends that visit and spend time with them.  With advances in healthcare most patients are treated in an outpatient setting, where they come in have a procedure or test run and then go back to their homes.  Today’s inpatients are more likely to have a serious condition and be there for a period of at least several days and sometimes even months.  This explains the growing trend of creating healthcare environments that make not only the patient, but also their loved ones feel like they can relax and maybe even forget that they’re at the hospital.  It is proven that if someone feels comfortable and relaxed, they can rest easier and heal faster{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

== Importance of Lighting and Sound ==

'''Lighting''' Eighty percent of what we interpret of our surroundings comes to us from what we see of our environment and that is greatly affected by the light available in that environment.  Lighting design in healthcare environments is a major factor in creating healing situations.  Since the design of healthcare environments is said to influence patient’s outcomes, yet high costs prevent most hospitals from renovating or rebuilding, changes in lighting becomes a cost-effective way to improve existing environments.  It is proven that people who are surrounded by natural light are more productive and live healthier lives.  When patients are sick, and surrounded by medical equipment and white walls, the last thing they need is a dark, stuffy room.  This is why it is important for every room to have a window for natural light to come into and help create a healing environment for the patient.

'''The Auditory Environment'''   While so much of the patient's experience is based on visual cues, the majority of meaning of their experience is auditory.  The many sounds of a hospital are foreign to their experience and their line of sight is limited.  Nightingale claimed that sounds that create "anticipation, expectation, waiting, and fear of surprise ...damage the patient."(&lt;ref name="notes on nursing" /&gt;).  Add to the perception and meaning attribute to any sound the factors of age-related hearing impairment common to older patients, heavy medication, pain, and other conditions, cognition is impacted as is the ability to understand language.  Hospital noise, at any volume level, is credited with being the primary cause of sleep deprivation, a contributing factor in delirium, and a risk factor for errors.&lt;ref&gt;BI&amp;T (Mazer, SE, Increase Patient Safety by Creating a Quieter Hospital Environment Biomedical Instrumentation &amp; Technology Journal, September/October 2010 - See more at: http://www.healinghealth.com/resources/increase-patient-safety/#sthash.VwFmiKBu.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;  The current pressure to reduce noise at night has been mistakenly understood to mean undue quiet at night when patients most need cues that people are around them and available if they need help.  Just s lighting must be designed to serve both day and night, so much the auditory environment be designed to support activity,cognition, rest, and sleep.

Adding to the above, patients need positive visual and auditory stimulation.  Nightingale called for variety, color, and form as a means of arousing creativity and health in patients.  Currently, using appropriate art, nature imagery and music are found to improve the experience of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Mazer, Susan E [1]; Music and Nature at the Bedside, Part I, published by Research Design Connections, 2009
Mazer, Susan E [2]; Music and Nature at the Bedside, Part II, published by Research Design Connections, 2010 /&lt;/ref&gt;  Technologies have afforded patients infinite options to use media as the choose.  The addition of beauty must also be accompanied by an attention to orderliness:  removal of clutter, trash, and other distractions.

== Prevention and control ==
* Using the '''health warning systems'''. A health system responsive to the needs of the population is required to refine the instruments to ensure adequate preparation before their hatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/HAN/|title=Health Alert Network (HAN). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Rev Adm Sanit. 2006; 4:425–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Transparency of the institutions''' public or private. The perception of crisis can escape the control of experts or health institutions, and be determined by stakeholders to provide solutions propagate or concerned. This requires a difficult balancing of the need to articulate clear answers and the little-founded fears.&lt;ref&gt;Abouzhr C, Adjei S, Kanchanachitra C. From data to policy: good practices and cautionary tales. Lancet. 2007; 369:1039–46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adequate '''information policy'''. Irrationality arise when information is distorted, or hidden. Face a health crisis involves: respect for society, coordination of organizations and an institution with scientific weight to the people and to the media, who acted as spokesman in situations of public health risk, to get confidence citizens. The technical capacity of health professionals is more proven than the public officials, which suggests a greater share of the former and better training of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/Risks/|title=Risk Communication- Gateway to Health Communication - CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcs.es/publicaciones/sistema_sanitario_situaciones_crisis.html|title=El Sistema Sanitario ante situaciones de crisis|first=Quodem Consultores S.L.|last=www.quodem.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamata F. Crisis sanitaria y respuesta política. Rev Adm Sanit. 2006; 4:401–6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Evaluate the previous crisis''' or others experiences. Crises are challenges that must be learned from both the mistakes and successes, since they serve to bring about to the devices and improve the response to other crises. It is important to perform analysis of previous responses, audit risk and vulnerability, research and testing, and drills to prepare themselves against future crises.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel PB, Le P, Ververs MT, et al.

* Preparing '''contingency plans'''. Preparation is key to the crisis because it allows a strong response, organized, and scientifically based. Action plans must meet the professional early enough and properly trained, and politicians must be consistent in their actions and coordinate all available resources. It is essential to invest in public health resources to prepare preventive measures and reducing health inequalities to minimize the impact of health crises, as they generally always the poorest suffer most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/mar/23/the-health-care-crisis-and-what-to-do-about-it/|title=The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It|first=Paul Krugman and Robin|last=Wells|date=23 March 2006|publisher=|via=The New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equipocesca.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/crisis-2007-05-22-el-pais-el-eterno-retorno-de-las-crisis-sanitarias.pdf|title=Gérvas J, Hernández I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14557">'''Coal ash''', also known as coal combustion residuals (CCRs), is the particulate residue that remains from burning coal. Depending on the chemical composition of the coal burned, this residue may contain toxic substances and pose a '''health risk''' to workers in coal-fired power plants. 

==Background==
Coal ash is found in coal-fired power plants.&lt;ref name="CoalAshBasics2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coal Ash Basics|url=http://www.epa.gov/coalash/coal-ash-basics|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is burned in coal-fired plants to produce electricity.&lt;ref name="DukeEnergy"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Do Coal-Fired Plants Work?|url=https://www.duke-energy.com/about-energy/generating-electricity/coal-fired-how.asp|website=Duke Energy|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the coal is pulverized and then burned to generate energy.&lt;ref name="DukeEnergy" /&gt; The particles that remain after burning coal is called coal ash.&lt;ref name="CoalAshBasics2016" /&gt; The production of coal combustion produces many by-products of coal ash.&lt;ref name="CoalAshBasics2016" /&gt; Some of these by-products are boiler slag, [[Flue-gas_desulfurization|flue gas desulfurization]] material, [[bottom ash]], [[fly ash]], scrubber residues, [[Cenosphere|cenospheres]] and [[fluidized bed combustion]] ash.&lt;ref name="CoalAshBasics2016" /&gt; Depending on the coal that was burned, the chemical composition found in coal ash can vary.&lt;ref name="CoalAsh2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coal Ash: Characteristics, Management and Environmental Issues|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/oira_2050/2050_meeting_101609-2.pdf|website=Electric Power Research Institute|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most coal ash will contain [[Aluminium_oxide|aluminum oxide]] (Al&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;O&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;), [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) and [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;).&lt;ref name="CoalAsh2009" /&gt; Regardless of the by-product produced, there are many toxic substances that are present in coal ash that can cause major health problems in humans.&lt;ref name="Breathing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lockwood|first1=Alan H.|last2=Evans|first2=Lisa|title=How Breathing Coal Ash Is Hazardous To Your Health|url=http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/ash-in-the-lungs.pdf|website=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoalToxic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gottlieb|first1=Barbara|last2=Gilbert|first2=Steven  G.|last3=Evans|first3=Lisa Gollin|title=Coal Ash The toxic threat to our health and environment|url=http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/coal-ash.pdf|website=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some toxic constituents that are found in coal ash are [[arsenic]], [[boron]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[Mercury_(element)|mercury]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]], [[thallium]] and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name="Breathing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoalToxic" /&gt;

In the [[United States]], approximately 44.6 percent of electricity is produced from over 450 coal-fired power plants.&lt;ref name="Breathing" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite web|title=United States National Library of Medicine|url=http://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/locations.php?id=155|website=Coal-Fired Power Plants|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, approximately 110 million tons of coal ash was produced from the coal that was burned in the United States.&lt;ref name=CoalAshBasics2016 /&gt; However, more than half of the coal ash produced is dumped into surface impoundments (wet storage) or [[Landfill|landfills]] (dry storage).&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Specifically, there are approximately 1,070 coal ash waste ponds and about 435 landfill sites located throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="Breathing" /&gt; The major problem of these disposal sites is the toxicity of coal ash escaping and causing harm to humans and the environment. When coal ash waste is not properly controlled, the toxic substances can affect drinking water, food and air.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt;

== Occupational health concerns ==
Coal ash contains many toxic substances that can negatively impact the human body. Employees working in coal-fired power plants or near coal ash waste sites are at major risk of inhaling coal ash dust.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt; Coal ash dust is generally known as particulate matter (particle pollution) and the dust particles can harm the lungs when inhaled.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Workers increase their risk of harmful side effects when they inhale the smallest coal ash dust particles.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt; The smaller the coal ash dust particle, the deeper the particle will be inhaled into the lungs.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt; As a result, the toxic particles can inflame the lungs causing severe damage to the body.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt; Furthermore, coal ash dust can enter the body through the nose causing damage to the brain directly.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt; However, regardless of particle entry, the toxicity from coal ash can cause harm to major body parts such as the [[brain]], [[Lung|lungs]], [[heart]], [[liver]], [[Kidney|kidneys]], [[stomach]] and intestines.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt;&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Thus, individuals working near coal ash surface impoundments or landfills are at increased risk for many serious health problems.

== Health effects of toxic constituents found in coal ash ==
'''Lead''': The exposure of lead in coal ash can cause major damage to the nervous system.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Lead exposure can lead to kidney disease, hearing impairment, high blood pressure, delays in development, swelling of the brain, hemoglobin damage, and male reproductive problems.&lt;ref name=DamagingHealth&gt;{{cite web|title=Coal Ash Toxics: Damaging to Human Health|url=http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/coal-ash-toxics-damaging-to-human-health.pdf|website=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lead&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead and compounds (inorganic); CASRN 7439-92-1|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/iris_documents/documents/subst/0277_summary.pdf|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both low levels and high levels of lead exposure can cause harm to the human body.&lt;ref name=DamagingHealth /&gt;

'''Cadmium''': When coal ash dust is inhaled, high levels of cadmium is absorbed into the body.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; More specifically, the lungs directly absorb cadmium into the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=DamagingHealth /&gt; When humans are exposed to cadmium over a long period of time, kidney disease and lung disease can occur.&lt;ref name="CoalToxic" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DamagingHealth /&gt; In addition, cadmium exposure can be associated with hypertension.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Lastly, chronic exposure of cadmium can cause bone weakness which increases the risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt;

'''Chromium''': The exposure of chromium (IV) in coal ash can cause lung cancer and asthma when inhaled.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; When coal ash waste pollutes drinking water, chromium (IV) can cause ulcers in the small intestine and stomach when ingested. &lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Lastly, skin ulcers can also occur when the exposure chromium (IV) in coal ash comes in contact with the skin.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; 

'''Arsenic''': When high amounts of arsenic is inhaled or ingested through coal ash waste, diseases such as bladder cancer, skin cancer, kidney cancer and lung cancer can develop.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt;&lt;ref name=Arsenic&gt;{{cite web|title=Arsenic Toxicity What are the Routes of Exposure for Arsenic?|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=1&amp;po=6|website=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, exposure of arsenic over a long period of time can cause mortality.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Furthermore, low levels of arsenic exposure can cause irregular heartbeats, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy and vision impairment.&lt;ref name=DamagingHealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; 

'''Mercury''': Chronic exposure of mercury from coal ash can cause harm to the nervous system.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; When mercury is inhaled or ingested various health effects can occur such as vision impairment, seizures, numbness, memory loss and sleeplessness.&lt;ref name=Mercury&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury and health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs361/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MercuryNIH&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002476.htm|website=MedlinePlus|publisher=United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boron''': When coal ash dust is inhaled, the exposure of boron can cause discomfort in the throat, nose and eye.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Moreover, when coal ash waste is ingested, boron exposure can be associated with kidney, liver, brain, and intestine impairment.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; 

'''Molybdenum''': When molybdenum is inhaled from coal ash dust, discomfort of the nose, throat, skin and eye can occur.&lt;ref name=Molybdenum&gt;{{cite web|title=Right to Know Hazardous Substance Fact Sheet|url=http://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1309.pdf|website=New Jersey Department of Health|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, short-term molybdenum exposure can cause an increase of wheezing and coughing.&lt;ref name=Molybdenum /&gt;  Furthermore, chronic exposure of molybdenum can cause loss of appetite, tiredness, headaches and muscle soreness.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt;&lt;ref name=Molybdenum /&gt; 

'''Thallium''': The exposure of thallium in coal ash dust can cause peripheral neuropathy when inhaled.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Furthermore, when coal ash is ingested, thallium exposure can cause diarrhea and vomiting.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; In addition, thallium exposure is also associated with heart, liver, lung and kidney complications.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt;  

'''Silica''': When silica is inhaled from coal ash dust, fetal lung disease or silicosis can develop.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt; Furthermore, chronic exposure of silica can cause lung cancer.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt; In addition, exposure to silica over a period of time can cause loss of appetite, poor oxygen circulation, breathing complications and fever.&lt;ref name=Breathing /&gt;

== Coal ash reuse ==
[[Reuse of coal ash]] benefits the environment by reducing the production of greenhouse gas and reducing the need to use virgin materials.&lt;ref name=reuse&gt;{{cite web|title=Coal Ash Reuse|url=https://www.epa.gov/coalash/coal-ash-reuse|website=Coal Ash|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when coal ash is recycled, costs related to coal ash disposal sites are avoided.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuse /&gt; Thus, when coal ash is reused both the environment and economy are benefited. 

There are two forms of coal ash recycling- “encapsulated” and “unencapsulated."&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuse /&gt; When coal ash is bound to other materials it is encapsulated.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; For example, coal ash can be reused in making concrete, bricks and wallboards.&lt;ref name=reuse /&gt; On the other hand, unencapsulated use of coal ash is when the ash is not bound to other materials (loose particulate or sludge form).&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuse /&gt; An example of unencapsulated coal ash is distributing the ash on icy roads in the winter.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; 

Even though reusing coal ash minimizes health effects in humans, health problems can still occur when coal ash is recycled.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Specifically, workers drilling or cutting encapsulated coal ash increase their risk of inhaling coal ash dust.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; In addition, when unencapsulated coal ash is scattered on snowy streets in the winter, the loose ash can come in contact with ditches on the side of the road.&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; As a result, the toxins from coal ash can “leach” into the water streams polluting above-ground waterways and eventually contaminating underground water supplies (drinking water).&lt;ref name=CoalToxic /&gt; Therefore, both forms of recycled coal ash (encapsulated and unencapsulated) can cause serious health issues in humans.

== Coal ash waste regulations ==
In the United States, the only federal regulation regarding the disposal of coal ash is called “Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities”, which was signed into law on December 19th, 2014.&lt;ref name=Rule&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Environmental Protection Agency|url=https://www.epa.gov/coalash/coal-ash-rule|website=Final Rule: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when coal ash is disposed into surface impoundments and landfills, coal ash is regulated as non-hazardous solid waste under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA).&lt;ref name=Rule /&gt; Thus, the requirements of the coal ash disposal law is regulated under subtitle D of the RCRA.&lt;ref name=Rule /&gt;

In order for this federal regulation to be effective, there are some major requirements that surface impoundments and landfill facilities must follow. This rule requires facilities to prevent and control coal ash dust from accumulating into the air.&lt;ref name=Rule /&gt; As a result, facilities must provide annual plans for coal ash dust control.&lt;ref name=Rule /&gt; Furthermore, there are location restrictions where new landfills and surface impoundments can be built.&lt;ref name=Rule /&gt; In addition, if regulations of coal ash dust control are not maintained, closure of the facility will occur under the federal law.&lt;ref name=Rule /&gt; The law also requires all coal ash waste facilities to create annual groundwater monitoring reports.&lt;ref name=Rule /&gt; Lastly, all coal ash waste surface impoundments and landfills must keep a written record of the federal regulations at the facility for five years.&lt;ref name=Rule /&gt;&lt;ref name=SoutheastWaste&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the EPA RCRA Coal Ash Rule|url=http://www.southeastcoalash.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CoalAshDisposalRule_Summary_Disclaimer.pdf|website=Southeast Coal Ash Waste|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, this recent federal regulation is trying to eliminate occupational health concerns and environmental health issues regarding coal ash toxicity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4539">'''Heterogeneous medical condition''' in medicine are those [[medical condition]]s which have several [[etiologies]], like [[hepatitis]] or [[diabetes]]. Medical conditions are normally defined pathologically (liver inflammation) or clinically (excessive urination) and not etiologically, and therefore it is normal to have more than one cause for them. The word is used as an opposition to [[homogeneous]], meaning that given a group of patients, the disease is the same for all of them.

When a condition is heterogeneous, it is normally divided in [[endotype]]s.

==Endotype==
{{main|endotype}}
An '''endotype''' is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or [[Pathobiology|pathobiological]] mechanism. This is distinct from a [[Phenotype (clinical medicine)|phenotype]], which is any observable characteristic or trait of a [[disease]], such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that [[patient]]s with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.

One example is asthma, which is considered to be a [[syndrome]], consisting of a series of endotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lötvall |first1=Jan |last2=Akdis |first2=Cezmi A. |last3=Bacharier |first3=Leonard B. |last4=Bjermer |first4=Leif |last5=Casale |first5=Thomas B. |last6=Custovic |first6=Adnan |last7=Lemanske Jr. |first7=Robert F. |last8=Wardlaw |first8=Andrew J. |last9=Wenzel |first9=Sally E. |last10=Greenberger |first10=Paul A. |title=Asthma endotypes: A new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |date=February 2011 |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=355–360 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2010.11.037 |pmid=21281866}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the concept of [[disease entity]]

==Heterogeneity in medical conditions==

The term '''medical condition''' is a [[nosology|nosological]] broad term that includes all diseases, disorders, injuries and [[syndrome]]s, and it is specially suitable in the last case, in which it is not possible to speak about a single disease associated to the clinical course of the patient.

While the term ''medical condition'' generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all [[mental disorder]]s, uses the term ''general medical condition'' to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders |edition=4th |location=Washington, DC |author=American Psychiatric Association. Task Force on DSM-IV |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature. Some [[health insurance]] policies also define a ''medical condition'' as any illness, injury, or disease except for psychiatric illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinsurancepage.co.uk/expat-insurance-glossary.html |title=Expat Insurance Glossary by The Insurance Page |accessdate=2008-11-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027142342/http://www.theinsurancepage.co.uk/expat-insurance-glossary.html |archivedate=2008-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is more [[value-neutral]] than terms like ''disease'', the term ''medical condition'' is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious. It is also preferred when etiology is not unique, because the word disease is normally associated to the cause of the clinical problems. On the other hand, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the [[autism rights movement]].

The term is also used in specialized areas of the medicine. A genetic or allelic heterogeneous condition is one where the same disease or condition can be caused, or contributed to, by varying different genes or alleles. In clinical trials and statistics the concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous populations is important. The same applies for [[epidemiology]]

'''Kazutaka Kogi''' (born 1933) is a Japanese academic known for his contributions to simple, low-cost [[Organization development#OD interventions|interventions]] in small manufacturing enterprises that improve the [[working conditions]] for the employees and at the same time also improve the overall [[productivity]] of the workforce.  The interventions are based on simple and low-cost modifications, on local solutions to highly specific local problems and specifically on the collaboration between the shopfloor and the managerial level.  This collaborative or participatory approach is possible because the intervention is presented as a [[win-win game|win-win situation]] for both parties.  Kazutaka Kogi and his colleague [[Kageyo Noro]] are considered to have founded the concept of [[participatory ergonomics]] in Singapore in 1983&lt;ref&gt;Karwowski and Maras (1999) p1422&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked extensively for the [[International Labour Organization]] and held the Vice-Presidency for [[ICOH]] in 2006-2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5545">Maternal death or maternal mortality is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes." The maternal mortality rate, on the other hand, is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 births. The maternal mortality is used as a criterion for the quality of medical care in a country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13829">'''MAP International''' is a global Christian health and relief organization that partners with people living in conditions of poverty to save lives and develop healthier families and communities.  Recognized for their 99% efficiency rating, they respond to the needs of those they serve by providing medicines, preventing disease and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change. Their mission is to advance the total health of people living in the world’s poorest communities. They carry out that mission in the broad programmatic areas of community health development, disease prevention and eradication, relief and rehabilitation and global health advocacy.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
'''MAP International was founded as Medical Assistance Programs International''', an organization that provides medical supplies abroad, encourages community health development, prevents disease, and responds to disasters, was founded in 1954 by J. Raymond Knighton, the first Executive director of the [[Christian Medical and Dental Society|Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS)]]. MAP International is a member of [http://www.integralalliance.org Integral], an international cooperation of 19 Christian aid organizations. MAP International’s first project was to supply Shering Corporation and Eli Lilly’s donation of 11 tons of medicines abroad in developing areas. 

=== Disaster relief ===
Since then, MAP International has instituted numerous projects including but not limited to emergency relief efforts after Typhoon Gloria in Taiwan, civilian casualties in Panama, the fall of the Soviet Union, Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, the fall of the Taliban, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, and Zika relief in Latin America. MAP International also started Fellowship programs to train medical students, opened offices in developing areas such as Ecuador, Kenya, and West Africa, and donated billions of dollars in medicines and supplies to people in need.

=== Mission statement ===
MAP's Mission | MAP International is a global Christian health and relief organization that partners with people living in conditions of poverty to save lives and develop healthier families and communities. Recognized for our 99% efficiency rating, we respond to the needs of those we serve by providing medicines, preventing disease and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change. Our mission is to advance the Total Health of people living in the world’s poorest communities. We carry out that mission in the broad programmatic areas of community health development, disease prevention and eradication, relief and rehabilitation and global health advocacy. Although MAP International is a Christian organization, it has a policy against discrimination based on religion, gender, race, and other aspects of an individual’s background, and will not refuse help to anyone based on these classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/content/about-map-guiding-principles|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Credibility ==
MAP International’s status as a highly credible organization is well attested to by multiple well-known sources. [[Forbes|Forbes, Inc.]] recognizes MAP International as the #37 Largest U.S. Charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/map-international/|title=MAP International on the Forbes The 100 Largest U.S. Charities List|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the MAP International program is very well recognized and generates a large amount of revenue. It illuminates important aspects of the program such as its donor dependency, total revenue, amount spent on charitable work, and fundraising efficiency. [[Better Business Bureau|BBB]] lists MAP International as an accredited charity, meaning it meets the standards in terms of governance, measuring effectiveness, finances, and fund raising and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/relief-and-development/map-international-in-brunswick-ga-1681|title=Charity Report - MAP International - give.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charity Navigator]] rates MAP International as 100 out of 100, and four out of four stars, and includes information about the program’s accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4042#.UmNRshbU7lJ|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for MAP International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNBC named MAP International #2 on their list of Top-Ten Charities Changing the World in 2015.  [[POPLINE|Popline]] points out that some health workers have biases against working with faith-based programs, but that the merits of the MAP International program should dispel these biases. It also discusses the financial benefits of FBOs in relation to “their ability to leverage volunteer work with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popline.org/node/241130Green, E. C. (2003, September 24). Faith-based Organization: Contributions to HIV Prevention. Popline.]&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Current projects ==

=== Disaster relief ===
MAP International works to respond to both natural and conflict related emergencies. MAP International provides medical relief shipments to those in need and monitors the health of those in need, if an emergency occurs in a country MAP International has instituted a country presence it implements a country office response in which MAP International staff mobilize to provide health care, and utilizes community based disaster mitigation to train community members to manage the effects of the disaster and promote health in the wake of the disaster on a long-term scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//DISASTER%20RELIEF%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt; Current MAP International disaster relief programs include Typhoon Haiyan: Philippines, Cyclone Phailin, Oklahoma Tornado, and Syrian Refugee relief. MAP International has responded to Typhoon Haiyan by shipping $4.2 million in medicines and supplies, and is still in the process of responding by providing emergency health care kits to victims. MAP International recognizes its partners for their integral role in efficiently distributing donated medicines and supplies, and states the difficulties they have encountered in getting the medicines to the victims. For example, all of the medicine shipments in Leyte Island were washed away when the typhoon hit that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/content/emergency-response/568/typhoon_haiyan_map_is_responding|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the detrimental effects of Cyclone Phailin, MAP International is providing India with temporary shelter structures, food, medicine, and cooking utensils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/emergency-response/499/cyclone_phailin_hits_india|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAP International has responded to the Oklahoma Tornado by donating over $127,000 of supplies to their partner, Convoy of Hope, in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/oklahoma-relief|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation also mentions MAP International's affiliation with Abbott in response to the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bclc.uschamber.com/site-page/oklahoma-tornadoes-corporate-aid-tracker|title=(2013). Oklahoma Tornadoes--Current Aid Tracker. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the civil war in Syria, MAP International has sent two shipments to refugees, and is still responding by preparing a third shipment to send when sufficient funding is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/syria-relief|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saporta Report outlines MAP International's involvement in Syrian Refugee Crisis relief efforts, and briefly describes the cost of these emergency aid kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saportareport.com/blog/2013/04/map-international-providing-medical-relief-to-syrian-refugees/|title=MAP International providing medical relief to Syrian refugees  - SaportaReport|date=29 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community members take part in many aspects of other current projects listed such as water and sanitation efforts and disease treatment, as well as working to settle conflict, train local health promoters, and facilitate economic security.&lt;ref name="map.org"/&gt;

=== Water and sanitation ===
Water and Sanitation are aspects assimilated into all MAP International programs because of the significant impact they have on preventing disease and promoting other facets of Total Health. Water and Sanitation efforts involve building separate waste and clean drinking structures, providing water filters to communities, and establishing Community Led Total Sanitation programs. MAP International utilizes a [[sweat equity]] design to implement [http://www.sawyer.com Sawyer] water filters in underserved communities and implements a small-scale demonstration with the help of a few members in the community before introducing water sanitation efforts on a large-scale throughout the village. Sawyer attests to the integral role MAP International has played in distributing hundreds water filters to communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawyer.com/sawyersaves/kenya.html|title=Kenya - Sawyer International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community Led Total Sanitation programs are designed to educate and empower local community members to make their village a more sanitary and healthy environment through education about the negative health effects of drinking unclean water and the importance of separating human waste structures and drinking water structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//WATER%20AND%20SANITATION%20FINAL.pdf (2013).

Nkosi's Haven was named after Nkosi Johnson, a young AIDS activist who died on International [[Children's Day|Children's Day]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=Nkosi Johnson's History|url=http://nkosishaven.org/nkosi-johnsons-history/|website=Nkosi's Haven|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born Xolani Nkosi, Nkosi was infected with HIV through [[mother-to-child transmission]]. Nkosi and his mother were admitted to an AIDS care centre in Johannesburg, where they met Gail Johnson, a volunteer worker.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Due to financial restraints, the care centre that Nkosi and his mother were living in closed down. Nkosi's mother's health was deteriorating rapidly and she was unable to keep Nkosi due to her health conditions and financial dependency. She also feared that the community would find out that both herself and Nkosi were HIV positive and exile them.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beresford|first1=Belinda|title=Nkosi Johnson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/02/guardianobituaries.aids|accessdate=5 December 2016|issue=Special report: Aids|publisher=The Guardian News and Media Limited|date=2 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Gail Johnson took Nkosi into her care, changing his name to Nkosi Johnson, and became his legal foster mother.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Gail Johnson attempted to enroll Nkosi into school in Johannesburg and was faced with backlash as soon as Nkosi's HIV status was made public.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; In 1997, Johnson took the case to court, winning her case and forcing the South African educational system to revise their admittance policies discriminating against children with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/gail-johnson|title=Gail Johnson|last=South African History Online|first=|date=16 August 2016|website=www.sahistory.org.za|publisher=South African History Online|access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nkosi's experience with discrimination due to his health status and the forced separation between him and his mother, Nkosi's dream was to create an HIV/AIDS care centre in which children and their mothers could live freely without prejudice or discrimination because of their health status. With the help of his foster mother, Gail, Nkosi opened Nkosi's Haven in 1999, providing hundreds of mothers and their children with a safe space and communal environment.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Nkosi's journey made him the national figure in the fight against AIDS.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; In July 2000, Nkosi wrote and presented a speech at the [[XIII International AIDS Conference, 2000|13th International Aids Conference]], held in [[Durban]], which was televised worldwide.&lt;ref name="Thom Anso"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thom|first1=Anso|title=Nkosi Johnson, you were the Hector Pieterson of the Aids generation|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-07-10-nkosi-johnson-you-were-the-hector-pieterson-of-the-aids-generation/#.WDInK2QrK00|accessdate=20 November 2016|publisher=Daily Maverick|date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 11 years old, he spoke to delegates about his experience growing up with HIV. His fight with HIV birthed his dream to raise awareness and erase the stigma of HIV/AIDS through communal, supportive environments and care centres.&lt;ref name="Thom Anso" /&gt; Nkosi is most famously known for his quote,
“We are normal. We have hands. We have feet. We can walk, we can talk, we have needs just like everyone else- don't be afraid of us- we are all the same!"&lt;ref name="Thom Anso" /&gt;

A year before his death, Nkosi suffered through severe brain damage and viral infections due to AIDS. He was bedridden, emaciated, suffering from seizures and unable to eat solid foods. After battling the disease for 12 years, Nkosi Johnson died in his sleep on 1 June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loof|first1=Susanna|title=Young AIDS Activist Dies|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81001&amp;page=1|accessdate=6 December 2016|agency=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|date=1 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkosi was given a hero's burial memorial service in Johannesburg with thousands of attendees paying their respects to the late activist.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

At the time of his death, Nkosi Johnson was South Africa's longest surviving child born with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=28 July 2014|title=The critical condition of rhetorical choices The Bush administration's framing of HIV/AIDS as a national security threat in PEPFAR|journal=The Journal of International Communication|volume=21|issue=2|pages=226–240|last1=Yartey|first1=Franklin Nii Amankwah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he was awarded with the International Children's Peace Prize for his fight against HIV/AIDS and activist efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/nkosi-johnson|title=Nkosi Johnson|website=South African History Online|publisher=South African History Online|last1=South African History Online|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, [[Nelson Mandela]] released a statement, recognizing Nkosi as an "icon of the struggle for life" who fought fearlessly against HIV/AIDS. He urged everyone to give their support during this time, acknowledging Nkosi as an ambassador for South Africa and its people, especially those living with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mandela|first1=Nelson|title=Message By Nelson Mandela about Nkosi Johnson|url=http://www.mandela.gov.za/mandela_speeches/2001/0106_nkosi.htm|website=www.mandela.gov.za|publisher=Nelson Mandela Foundation|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkosi Johnson's legacy lives on through the work of Nkosi's Haven.

== HIV/AIDS in South Africa ==
[[South Africa]] has had high rates of [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV/AIDS]] diagnoses for years, with approximately 6.19 million accounted individuals living with HIV/AIDS in 2015.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Statistics South Africa|title=Mid-year population estimates 2015|url=https://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022015.pdf|website=Statistics South Africa|publisher=Statistics South Africa|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the age group of adults aged 15–49 years old, 16.6% of that cohort is HIV positive. HIV/AIDS related deaths have been declining as of recent years, with 2005 being the year with the highest number of deaths in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt; Thereafter, [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral treatment]] was administered and easily accessible, changing the patterns of HIV/AIDS and extending the lifespan of many South Africans who would have otherwise died at an earlier age.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

HIV/AIDS related illnesses are still high, with an increase of 4.02 million people living with HIV in South Africa from 2002 to 2015. Statistics South Africa approximates that every one out of five South African females in their reproductive ages are living with HIV.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

UNAIDS reports that approximately 2.1 million children in South Africa are orphans due to HIV/AIDS related illnesses, with 180,000 deaths occurring in the year of 2015. Women over the age of 15 account for 4 million people living with HIV, and approximately 240,000 children under the age of 14 have been affected by HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNAIDS|title=HIV and AIDS estimates (2015)|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/southafrica|website=www.unaids.org|publisher=UNAIDS|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has shown that the HIV/AIDS crisis has had a significant impact on South African family life. Responsibility for children growing up in South African society has been increasingly separate from biological parenthood due to the lack of parental care available.&lt;ref name="Law of SA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Merwe|first1=C.G|last2=du Plessis|first2=Jacques E.|title=Introduction to the Law of South Africa|date=2004|publisher=Luwer Law International|location=The Netherlands|isbn=9041122826|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under many circumstances, children often  care for their own families due to the circumstances created by the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS epidemic]].&lt;ref name="Law of SA" /&gt;

== Nkosi's Haven history ==

=== Berea ===
In 1999, Nkosi and Gail opened their first Nkosi's Haven location in Berea, Johannesburg. Despite being close to the city centre, selling properties became increasingly difficult in Berea, with the neighbouring area of [[Hillbrow, Johannesburg|Hillbrow]] beside, as it became an area that was frequented with street children and the unemployed.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Jane|title=Nkosi's Story|date=15 September 2011|publisher=New Africa Books|location=South Africa|isbn=0864865333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s was an era of high crime rates in downtown Johannesburg, which neighboured Hillbrow and Berea. After the apartheid ended in the 1990s, many gangs, along with residents from neighbouring townships, moved into the area making it unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanes|first1=Stephanie|title=Ponte City – a South African landmark – rises again|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0212/p20s01-woaf.html|accessdate=21 December 2016|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the property was offered to Gail Johnson, rent free for 5 years.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt;[[File:Hillbrow Johannesburg 01.jpg|thumb|The intersection of Pretoria Street and Banket Street in Hillbrow, Johannesburg]]

The house was located on 23 Mitchell street and consisted of four bedrooms, one bathroom upstairs and one downstairs, a lounge, a room used as a dormitory, and a courtyard.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt; Renovations and repairs were needed, in addition to furniture and basic house necessities. To raise funds for the completion of the house, Gail, a former public relations consultant, held a “kitchen tea” in which a wish list was created and publicized in the media and to those who were potential contributors.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt; At the tea, Gail explained the reasons behind the creation of Nkosi's Haven. She explained that Nkosi's Haven was to offer a [[kibbutz]] style of living in which residents would take turns at cooking, cleaning, caring for the children, and helping care for each other as needed.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt; Gail also told the guests that they already reached capacity for residence at the house. At the time, the house fit nine mothers and their children with presumed costs starting at R28,000 monthly.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt; The results of the kitchen tea were successful and Gail managed to fundraise R45,000 worth of furniture and equipment, free electrical services, along with appliances valued at R30,000 for the nursery and dormitory.&lt;ref name="Jane Fox" /&gt;

After 3 years in operation, Nkosi's Haven saw need for a second home as the Berea residence was rapidly expanding with mothers and children living with HIV/AIDS and orphans. In 2002, a separate plot of land was purchased south of Johannesburg. Upon development, both residences catered to over 160 residents and their children providing meals, medication, education, daily necessities for residents living with or without HIV/AIDS, and care for orphans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to financial restraints, in 2012, the NGO sold its property in Berea and moved all occupants to Nkosi's Haven Village in Alan Manor, South of Johannesburg.&lt;ref name="Theresa Taylor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Theresa|title=Nkosi’s Haven to move from Berea|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/nkosis-haven-to-move-from-berea-1310700|website=www.iol.co.za/|publisher=The Star|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs for operating the Berea house were as much as R150,000 to R180,000 monthly, and because all occupants could be accommodated at the village, consolidating all residents meant that no one was left without a home or unemployed. Given that Nkosi's Haven village had bigger plans in motion, the shift would focus on different things such as training opportunities for residents at the newly purchased farm and other facilities at the Nkosi's Haven Village.&lt;ref name="Theresa Taylor" /&gt; These opportunities were unavailable in Berea due to space and financial constraints. Gail reasoned this by stating, “We are not the Titanic. We are consolidating... it makes sense to consolidate and save money.”&lt;ref name="Theresa Taylor" /&gt;

=== Alan Manor ===
[[File:Nkosi's Haven Village.jpg|thumb|Inside Nkosi's Haven Village. Pictured in the background is one of 17 cottages used to house resident mothers, their children, and orphans.]]
Nkosi's Haven grew so rapidly that in 2002, a second 2.5 acre plot of land was purchased in the Alan Manor neighbourhood, south of Johannesburg to begin the development of Nkosi's Haven Village. This was made possible through a grant from the [[Gauteng]] Department of Housing, Social Housing and Special Needs.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=Nkosi's Haven Village|url=http://nkosishaven.org/what-we-do/nkosis-haven-village/|website=www.nkosishaven.org|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the project received backlash from neighbouring communities, key sponsors made the initiative possible and enabled Nkosi's Haven to host up to 180 residents at a time.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

Nkosi's Haven Village in Alan Manor consists of 17 cottages in which residents reside in, a sickbay, a library, a baby day care, a therapy block, a kitchen, a bakery, and a leisure block. There are also workshops and classrooms such as a computer room and an arts room for additional education and skill building. Administrative offices are located near the sickbay.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt; All residents share household tasks and duties that help with the functioning of the village, providing a sense of leadership and empowerment to residents through skill-building activities.

==== Bakery ====

In 2010, Nkosi's Haven received a bakery donation from the South African Whole Grain Bread Project (SAGWBP). In addition to the onsite bakery container donation, SAGWBP donated enough bread mix for six months.&lt;ref name="Bakery"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=Unique Container Bakery Turns On the Heat at Nkosi’s Haven Village|url=http://nkosishaven.org/unique-container-bakery-turns-on-the-heat-at-nkosis-haven-village/|website=www.nkosishaven.org|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; White and brown loaves are still produced for resident consumption and are marketed to other organizations in the community at a competitive price.&lt;ref name="Bakery" /&gt; The residents of Nkosi's Haven Village handle oversight of operations in the bakery. While providing skill-building opportunities, those who assist can also earn a stipend for their labour.&lt;ref name="Bakery" /&gt;

==== Kitchen ====

In 2009, Nkosi's Haven opened their new, industrial sized kitchen through generous donations from sponsors. Employed resident mothers cook to feed the large number of residents, serving hundreds of meals daily. Three well-balanced meals are provided to every resident mother, all children and volunteers.&lt;ref name="What We Do" /&gt;

==== Leisure Block ====

[[File:Nkosi's Haven Leisure Block.jpg|thumb|A playground onsite at Nkosi's Haven Village in the Leisure Block.]]
A leisure room was built at Nkosi's Haven Village to further meet the requirements to become a Child Care Centre in South Africa. Dance lessons take place in the large space on a weekly basis. The room is painted with bright colours, equipped with colourful furniture, bean bag chairs, a television, and foosball tables.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;
[[File:Nkosi's Haven Leisure Complex.jpg|thumb|One of the areas of Nkosi's Haven Leisure Complex in Johannesburg where residents play sports and host games.]]

==== Library ====

Nkosi's Haven Library provides a space for resident children to do their homework, leisurely reading, art sessions and workshops. Workshops include HIV/AIDS awareness sessions and life skills for women.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt; Through funding, the Haven continues to expand its book collection in hopes to educate and provide relevant resources for residents.

A recent project development was the implementation of [[bibliotherapy]] at the library in 2010. The bibliotherapy program used books to assist the children and young teens with coping with social, emotional and physical issues.&lt;ref name="Tukhareli"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tukhareli|first1=Natalia|title=Bibliotherapy in a Library Setting: Reaching out to Vulnerable Youth|journal=The Canadian Journal of Library and Information Practice and Research|date=2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program identified the children's needs and used a variety of programs to help eradicate the isolation of people living with HIV/AIDS through education, self-awareness, skill development, and recreation.&lt;ref name="Tukhareli" /&gt; Some sessions included storytelling, reading aloud, and "The Wall of Happiness Sessions" in which participants openly discussed what made them happy with the facilitator.&lt;ref name="Tukhareli" /&gt; The program was made available to all residents at Nkosi's Haven, including orphans and those who were free of HIV/AIDS in order to increase overall awareness. Results of the program showed success among residents, with 92% of young participants demonstrating increased knowledge and understanding about HIV/AIDS related issues, 78% demonstrating an increase in comfort and decrease in fear around HIV/AIDS related issues, and 91% of adults demonstrating an improvement in self-esteem and optimistic attitudes.&lt;ref name="Tukhareli" /&gt;

==== Music and Arts ====

A music and arts centre has been built onsite for resident use. This centre includes a keyboard and drums and is also a space that is used by the choir. Due to limited space and resources, Nkosi's Haven relies on the help of volunteers to teach music and arts lessons onsite. Programs are run year-round for mothers and their children.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

An ongoing workshop is artsINSIDEOUT's annual two-week art camp that runs at Nkosi's Haven. With the help of ASTEP (Artists Striving to End Poverty), a unique art program featuring successful and competitive professionals from all areas of art including students and graduates from [[Juilliard]], ASTEP volunteer artists use storytelling, singing, acting, dancing and visual arts to inspire the youth at Nkosi's Haven to build community, consciousness and self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Artists Striving to End Poverty"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Artists Striving to End Poverty|title=South Africa Program|url=https://www.astep.org/artsinsideout/|website=www.astep.org|publisher=Artists Striving to End Poverty|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, artsINSIDEOUT has organized trips to Nkosi's Haven for 6 years and has provided funding for year-round programming, including workshops and cultural programs. Local artists are invited to join the diverse artsINSIDEOUT team to enhance cultural programs available to Nkosi's Haven.

==== Sickbay ====

In 2006, Nkosi's Haven Village completed the [[Sick bay|Sickbay]], consisting of a 9-bed unit, qualified nursing staff, and family physicians to help care for HIV positive residents. Many residents are sick due to AIDS related illnesses and are being administered quality treatment and ARV's as needed.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

==== Therapy Block ====

All children at Nkosi's Haven Village receive various forms of therapy, including [[Therapy|remedial]], [[Play therapy|play]], [[Occupational therapy|occupational]] and [[Speech therapy|speech]].&lt;ref name="What We Do" /&gt; The therapy block was completed in December 2009 and employs two full-time therapists onsite to assist residents living with HIV/AIDS. Therapists also assist with helping resident mothers disclose their HIV status to their children.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

==== Workshops and classrooms ====

Nkosi's Haven Village has one classroom and two workshops that act as a site for homework and afterschool programs. These areas offer skill-building workshops on a regular basis for residents to learn various skills such as knitting, pottery, resume writing, and more.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

With the help of BT South Africa, an ICT infrastructure company, Nkosi's Haven opened a communications centre in 2010. The room comes equipped with computer monitors valued at R100,000 which allows the youth at Nkosi's Haven to videoconference and chat with their mentors and friends worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=39569|title=BT helps children, mothers of Nkosi's Haven in SA reach for better future|last=BT|first=|date=9 December 2010|website=www.itweb.co.za|publisher=ITWeb Limited|access-date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infinite Family, an American organization that enables children living with HIV/AIDS  to connect with mentors worldwide, has provided more than 50 youth at Nkosi's Haven with mentors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This room is also used to assist resident youth with their homework.

==== Nkosi's Haven 4life Farm ====
Nkosi's Haven 4Life Farm, located 50&amp;nbsp;km south of Johannesburg, has been in operation since 2008. The farm is 12 acres and currently provides crops for meals at Nkosi's Haven Village. Foundation 4Life has helped support Nkosi's Haven for years and made contributions that helped begin the production of the farm.&lt;ref name="Farm"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nkosi's Haven|title=Nkosi's Haven 4Life Farm|url=http://nkosishaven.org/what-we-do/nkosis-4life-farm/|website=www.nkosishaven.org|publisher=Nkosi's Haven|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foundation 4Life|title=4Life Executives Visit Nkosi’s Haven|url=http://www.foundation4life.org/en/news/categories/20|website=www.foundation4life.org/|publisher=4Life Trademarks|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the next 5 years of full operation, Nkosi's Haven 4LIFE farm aims to implement a self-sustaining style of living in which mothers living with HIV/AIDS and their children from a neighbouring township and the surrounding area will assist in growing organic food to serve themselves, Nkosi's Haven's residents, and the local markets and supermarkets. The goal is to produce crops for sale in supermarket chains in South Africa once the farm is sustainable and crops are of good standard. A number of new cottages will be built on the farm to accommodate more mothers and their children in need of Nkosi's Haven's assistance.&lt;ref name="Farm" /&gt;

== Future projects ==

=== Preschool ===
Nkosi's Haven has begun construction on the premises to begin early interventions of child development, skill transfer and various forms of therapy. Given that children in South Africa are held back from attending school if they are undergoing forms of therapy, an onsite preschool bypasses those restrictions and enables youth to develop their skills while receiving therapy. Nkosi's Haven pays R1000 monthly for each toddler to attend preschool outside of Nkosi's Haven, thus, an onsite preschool will save financial resources and assist Nkosi's Haven in becoming self-sufficient and sustainable. Nkosi's Haven plans to hire certified teachers in addition to training resident mothers to assist at the preschool, also building their skills and capacity.&lt;ref name="Nkosi's Haven Village" /&gt;

[[File:OHSAS 18001-Borjpardis.jpg|thumbnail|Certificate of conformity to OHSAS 18001:2007]]
'''OHSAS 18001''', Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, (officially '''BS OHSAS 18001''') is a [[British Standard]] for occupational health and safety [[management system]]s. Compliance with it enables organizations to demonstrate that they have a system in place for occupational health and safety. BS OHSAS 18001 is being replaced by [[ISO 45001|ISO 45001]], which was published in March 2018 by the [[International Organization for Standardization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISO 45001 |url=https://www.iso.org/iso-45001-occupational-health-and-safety.html |website=www.iso.org |publisher=ISO official website |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations which are certified to BS OHSAS 18001 should migrate to ISO 45001 by March 2021 if they want to retain a recognized certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iso.org/news/ref2270.html|title=Let the migration begin|work=ISO|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origins==
Organizations worldwide recognize the need to control and improve health and safety performance and do so with occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMS). However, before 1999 there was an increase of national standards and proprietary certification schemes to choose from. This caused confusion and fragmentation in the market and undermined the credibility of individual schemes.

==Development==

Recognising this deficit, an international collaboration called the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) Project Group was formed to create a single unified approach. The Group comprised representatives from [[Standards organisation#National standards bodies|national standards bodies]], academic bodies, accreditation bodies, certification bodies and occupational safety and health institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_091362.pdf|title=International Labour Office Report, Page 2, Footnote 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UK’s national standards body, [[BSI Group]], providing the secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iso14000expert.com/publications/OHSASsurvey.pdf|title=Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) Management Systems,Standards and Certificates Survey - to 31 December 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on the best of existing standards and schemes, the OHSAS Project Group published the OHSAS 18000 Series in 1999. The Series consisted of two specifications: 18001 provided requirements for an OHS management system and 18002 gave implementation guidelines. As of 2005, around 16,000 organizations in more than 80 countries were using the OHSAS 18001 specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/Assessment-and-certification-services/management-systems/Business-areas/Occupational-health-and-safety-management/Updated-OHSAS-18001-coming-in-July/|title=BS OHSAS 18001 - Occupational Health &amp; Safety - BSI Group|website=www.bsigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 more than 54,000 certificates had been issued in 116 countries to OHSAS or equivalent OHSMS standards.

==Adoption as British Standard==
The OHSAS 18001 specification was updated in July 2007. Among other changes, the new specification was more closely aligned with the structures of [[ISO 9000]] and [[ISO 14000]] so that organizations could more easily adopt OHSAS 18001 alongside existing management systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/iso-45001/Resources/BSI-ISO45001-Revision-Whitepaper-EN-UK.pdf|title=ISO 45001 Whitepaper: A new International Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=BSIgroup.com|publisher=[[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]]|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the "health" component of "health and safety" was given greater emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/about-bsi/News-Room/BSI-News-Content/Disciplines/Risk-Management/BS-OHSAS-180012007/|title=Press releases, news, media centre, standards, ISO, 9001, 14001, 18001 - BSI Group|website=www.bsigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Later, the BSI Group decided to adopt OHSAS 18001 as a British standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; BSI Group subsequently adopted the updated 18002 guidance specification for publication as BS OHSAS 18002 in 2008.

==How they work==
{{technical|section|date=June 2013}}
Its supporters claim that an occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) promotes a safe and healthy working environment by providing a framework that helps organizations to:
* Identify and control health and safety risks
* Reduce the potential for accidents
* Aid legal compliance
* Improve overall performance

The OHSAS 18000 standards provide organizations with the elements of an effective safety management system which can be integrated with other management systems and help organizations achieve better occupational health and safety performance and economic objectives.

BS OHSAS 18001 specifies requirements for an OH&amp;S management system to help an organization develop and implement a policy and objectives, which take into account legal requirements and information about OH&amp;S risks. It applies to all types and sizes of organizations and accommodates diverse geographical, cultural and social conditions.

BS OHSAS 18002 provides guidance for establishing, implementing or improving a management system which is based on OHSAS 18001 and demonstrating successful implementation of OHSAS 18001.

OHSAS 18001 can be aligned with existing ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 management systems. Historically many organizations start with the quality management system ISO 9001, then add the environment management requirements from ISO 14001. Many organizations now look at implementing all three standards at once which can minimize costs and disruption. The standards can be integrated using a standard such as BSI’s [[PAS 99]].

==Disambiguation==
The OHSAS 18000 standards were written and published wholly outside of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) framework. To avoid confusion, [[ISO/IEC 18000|ISO 18000]] does exist – but it is a [[radio-frequency identification]] standard.

'''Overseas Student Health Care''' is a compulsory [[health insurance]] product required by [[international student]]s studying in [[Australia]]. OSHC is an insurance product that basically gives international students a level of insurance coverage that is based on the Australian [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] system. Overseas Student Health Cover is commonly referred to as OSHC. Students can arrange to pay for their OSHC through their educational institution. However, students can still choose their own OSHC provider even when their educational institution makes a specific recommendation because they have negotiated a preferred provider arrangement with a particular insurer.

== Deed ==

OSHC is only able to be offered by Australian private health insurers who have signed the Deed for the provision of Overseas Student Health Cover with the Australian government. The Deed outlines the conditions required to be met by the registered insurers in order to offer the OSHC product. A legal document between the Commonwealth of Australia and the relevant insurer, the Deed dictates the minimum benefits payable by the insurer, in addition to conditions for which it is not required to pay any benefits. 
In addition, clause 6.8 of the Deed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BB6090580215B214CA256F1900166600/$File/Template%20Overseas%20Student%20Health%20Cover%20Deed%20-%201%20July%202011.pdf | title=Template Overseas Student Health Cover Deed | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20130409180938/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BB6090580215B214CA256F1900166600/$File/Template%20Overseas%20Student%20Health%20Cover%20Deed%20-%201%20July%202011.pdf | archivedate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; stipulates the conditions under which the insurers can terminate policies and make refunds, specifically:

* Where the student decides not to come to Australia;
* Where the student has ceased studies and left Australia prior to the end of their visa;
* Where the student has had their application for an extended stay refused by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship;
* Where the student has been granted permanent residence;
* Where the student has been outside Australia for a period exceeding 3 months; or
* Where the student holds an OSHC from another insurer.

== Exceptions ==

OSHC is not needed if the student is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/stud/more/health-insurance-for-students | title=Health insurance for students | publisher=Department of Home Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a Norwegian student covered by the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme
* a Swedish student covered by the [[Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency]]
* a Belgian student covered under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia.

== Providers ==

As at 30 June 2013, there were 5 health insurers who are signatories to the Australian Government the Deed for the provision of Overseas Student Health Cover enabling them to offer OSHC. These insurers are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/overseas/oshc.htm|title=Overseas Student Health Cover|first=Private Health Insurance|last=Ombudsman|website=www.privatehealth.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5362">'''PIMEX''' is one of the so-called video exposure monitoring methods which are used in [[occupational hygiene]] practise since their introduction in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Rosen, G. 2005"&gt;Rosen, G.; Andersson, I.M.; Walsh, P.T.; Clark, R.D.R.; Säämänen, Arto; Heinonen, Kimmo; Riipinen, H.; Pääkkönen, R.. 2005. A review of video exposure monitoring as an occupational hygiene tool. Annals of Occupational Hygiene, vol. 49, 3, ss. 201–217 {{doi|10.1093/annhyg/meh110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The name PIMEX is an acronym from the words '''PI'''cture '''M'''ix '''EX'''posure, and implies that the method is based on mixing pictures, in this case from a [[video camera]], with data on a worker’s exposure to some agent. The main idea of the method is to make invisible [[hazard]]s in the work environment visible and in this manner facilitate the reduction of hazards in workplaces.

== Invention ==
The method PIMEX was originally developed in Sweden during the 1980s by Gunnar Rosén and Ing-Marie Andersson.&lt;ref&gt;Rosén G, Lundström S. (1987) Concurrent video filming and measuring for visualization of exposure. Am Indust Hyg Ass J; 48: 688–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosén G, Andersson I-M. (1989) Video filming and pollution measurement as a teaching aid in reducing exposure to airborne pollutants. Ann Occ Hyg; 33: 137–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar technique was developed also in USA where [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] researchers described a technique using a [[video overlay]] board and [[computer program]] to display, in real-time or after recording of data and video on tape, the measured value as a [[Bar chart|bar graph]] and the picture on the [[Computer display|computer screen]].&lt;ref&gt;Gressel M, Heitbrink WA, McGlothlin JD et al. (1987) Realtime, integrated, and ergonomic analysis of dust exposure during manual materials handling. Appl Ind Hyg J; 2: 108–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gressel MG, Heitbrink WA, McGlothlin JD et al. (1988) Advantages of [[real-time data]] acquisition for [[exposure assessment]]. Appl Ind Hyg; 3: 316–20&lt;/ref&gt; 

Video exposure monitoring has thereafter been further developed and used in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh PT, Clark RDR, Flaherty S et al.(2000) Computer-aided video exposure monitoring. Appl Occup Environ Hyg; 15: 48–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin P, Brand F, Servais M. (1999) Correlation of the exposure to a pollutant with a task-related action or workplace: the CAPTIV system. Ann Occup Hyg; 43: 221–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovein RJ. (1997) Video exposure monitoring at NIOSH: an update. Appl Occup Environ Hyg; 12: 638–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu F, McGlothlin JD. (2003) Video exposure assessments of solvent exposures in university pharmaceutical laboratories—a pilot study. Chemical Health and Safety; 10: 23–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The workers’ knowledge of risks associated with their tasks and, perhaps more importantly, how these risks can be controlled, is essential to improve their health.&lt;ref name="Rosen, G. 2005"/&gt; Applications of the PIMEX methods are various, focusing on work [[task analysis]], training and risk communication, encouraging worker participation in and motivation for improvements in the workplace environment.

== Use ==
PIMEX is used in many different countries. It is a widely used in the [[Netherlands]] for risk communication in the field of chemical exposure and it has been proven to be a very strong [[communication]] tool. There are more than 100 professional videos made with PIMEx for many different industries. They are all free available. The Dutch Ministry of social affairs developed a new promo video of PIMEX. It demonstrates the function and use of PIMEX with various examples from [[Occupational safety and health|working environments]].

There are a number of situations where PIMEX has been used:

* To train workers to use PPE and control measurements in the right way;
* To enlarge the knowledge of chemical risks and to motivate workers of management to use safe working procedures or to take measures;
* Workplace analyses (hazard identification);
* Visualization of a good practice method

In the Netherlands, the method is available to small and medium enterprises by the use of a half day workplace analysis or simple videos can be made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ects.nl/ ECTS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151614/http://www.ects.nl/ |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PIMEX is also used to visualize [[noise]], [[heat stress]], [[nanoparticle]]s, [[electromagnetic field]]s and  physical [[Structural load|load]]. In the Netherlands there are also videos available that are made for employees in health services who are working with a mobile [[Patient lift|patient hoist]]. Such mobile hoists are used to reduce physical overload. The video shows the difference in exposure between using the hoist in the wrong and the correct way, for example when the wheels are in the wrong or right position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6413">'''Participatory poverty assessment''' (PPA) is the approach to analyzing and reducing poverty by incorporating the views of the poor. PPAs attempt to better understand the poor, to give the poor more influence over decisions that affect their lives, and to increase effectiveness of poverty reduction policies.&lt;ref name="ppa_guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/238411/ppa.pdf |title=A rough guide to PPAs |author=Andy Norton with Bella Bird Karen Brock Margaret Kakande Carrie Turk |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hakikazi.org/tcdd/newpage7.htm |title=Presentation on Introduction to Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) |publisher=Hakikazi Catalyst |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPAs are seen as complements to traditional household surveys by helping to interpret survey results, and aim to capture the experiences of the poor by being more open-ended.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiii,xv}}

==History==

Before the 1990s, household-survey approaches were the main way to measure poverty. This shifted to participatory activities in the 1990s after critiques of these traditional methods.&lt;ref name="mcgee"&gt;McGee, Rosemary, ed. ''Knowing Poverty''. London, GB: Routledge, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 11 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,3}}

The term "participatory poverty assessment" was coined within the [[World Bank]] in 1992,&lt;ref name=ppa_guide/&gt; and was seen as a participatory form of poverty assessments (PAs, i.e. survey-based approaches).&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|2,3}}

Early experiences of PPAs were in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|3}}

By 1998, 43 PPAs had been conducted: 28 in Africa, 6 in Latin America, 5 in Eastern Europe, and 4 in Asia.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiii,xiv,15}}

Early PPAs focused most on making higher quality information available to policy makers, rather than seeing the poor as itself being involved in the process of reducing poverty.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Later in the 1990s, "second generation" PPAs appeared, which tried to allow the poor to influence policy decisions.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|4}}

As of 2012, the [[World Bank]]'s [[Voices of the Poor]] is the largest PPA ever to have been conducted.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|4}}

==Rationale and comparison to previous methods==

Both PPAs and traditional surveys contain both quantitative and qualitative information, as well as "subjective" and "objective" parts, so this is not necessarily a distinguishing feature of PPAs.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|4}} Rather:

{{quote |text=Traditional survey data can be used to count, compare, and predict.  The strength of the PPA is not in counting but rather in understanding hidden dimensions of poverty and analyzing causality and processes by which people fall into and get out of poverty.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}}}

PPAs are also distinguished from anthropological studies because the latter analyze few communities in depth, whereas PPAs analyze various communities of a country. PPAs also focus on policy decisions (which anthropological studies don't need to).&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5,6}}

==Types of methodologies and activities==

Within PPAs, various methodologies exist. Some PPAs use more than one methodology.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|6}}

* Field work and conducting interviews&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Rapid rural appraisal
* [[Participatory rural appraisal]] (includes use of visuals, such as matrices and diagramming)
* SARAR (self-esteem, associative strength, resourcefulness, action planning, and responsibility)
* Beneficiary assessment
* Semistructured interviews and focus groups

PPAs can last from several weeks to several months.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Organizations using this approach==

Various organizations have used PPAs as part of their work.

* [[World Bank]]
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|3}}
* [[Department for International Development]]&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|17}}
* [[ActionAid]]
* [[Asian Development Bank]]
* [[Danish International Development Agency]]
* [[Oxfam UK]]
* [[Thailand Development Research Institute]]

In addition, "secondary stakeholders" (i.e. organizations that do not conduct PPAs directly, but participate in PPAs) such as [[UNICEF]], various NGOs (e.g. [[Save the Children]] and [[Oxfam]]), academic institutions, etc., have also participated in PPAs.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Results==

Participatory poverty assessments confirmed the multidimensional nature of poverty (i.e. that the poor deal not just with lack of money, but with various problems like lack of resources, poor health, physical violence, social isolation, etc.) that was seen from traditional household questionnaire-based methods.&lt;ref name="robb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/22/000094946_99040105542482/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf |title=Can the Poor Influence Policy? Participatory Poverty Assessments in the Developing World |author=Caroline M. Robb |year=1999 |publisher=[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} PPAs have also been able to access information that was not obtained in household surveys by building trust. For instance PPAs have obtained information on sensitive topics such as [[child prostitution]], drug use, and [[domestic violence]] in relation to poverty.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiv}}

In [[Zambia]], PPAs discovered that the timing of school fees caused economic stress for households, so new legislation to change this timing was proposed.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xv}}

In [[Niger]], a PPA found that the poor see education only as a seventh priority for poverty reduction due to "the concern that what children learn had little relevance to getting people out of poverty". As a result of this PPA, food security was prioritized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/09/21/000160016_20060921172552/Rendered/PDF/373930PAPER0NE0participatory0poverty.pdf |title=Participatory Poverty Assessment - Niger}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vii}}

PPAs have also informed World Bank's [[World Development Report]]s.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|vi}}

[[Image:Paeonia officinalis officinalis0.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The generic garden peony]]
'''Peonidin''' is an [[O-methylated anthocyanidin]] derived from [[Cyanidin]], and a primary [[plant]] [[pigment]]. Peonidin gives purplish-red hues to flowers such as the [[peony]], from which it takes its name, and roses. It is also present in some blue flowers, such as the [[morning glory]].

Like most [[Anthocyanidin|anthocyanidins]], it is [[pH]] sensitive, and changes from red to blue as pH rises because anthocyanidins are highly conjugated chromophores. When the pH is changed, the extent of the conjugation (of the double bonds) is altered, which alters the wavelength of light energy absorbed by the molecule. (Natural anthocyanidins are most stable in a very low pH environment; at pH 8.0, most become colorless.)  At pH 2.0, peonidin is cherry red; at 3.0 a strong yellowish pink; at 5.0 it is grape red-purple; and at 8.0 it becomes deep blue; unlike many anthocyanidins, however, it is stable at higher pH, and has been isolated as a blue colorant from the brilliant "Heavenly Blue" morning glory (''Ipomoea tricolor Cav cv'').

Because of its unusual color stability, a cafeyl-acylated buffered formulation of it has been patented for use as food coloring.

Peonidin, like many anthocyanidins, has shown potent inhibitory and apoptotic effects on cancer cells ''in vitro'', notably metastatic human breast cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jung Yeon Kwon |author2=Ki Won Lee |author3=Haeng Jeon Hur |author4=Hyong Joo Lee | date = 2007 | title = Peonidin Inhibits Phorbol-Ester-Induced COX-2 Expression and Transformation in JB6 P+ Cells by Blocking Phosphorylation of ERK-1 and -2 | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1095  | issue = 1 | pages = 513–520 | doi=10.1196/annals.1397.055 | pmid=17404064}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A very large question, however, has been raised about anthocyanidins' penetration and retention in human cells ''in vivo'', due to their rapid elimination from the human body.

By far the greatest dietary source of peonidin is raw [[cranberry|cranberries]], which contain 42&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g of fruit.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Blueberries, plums, grapes, and cherries also contain significant amounts, ranging from 5 to 12&amp;nbsp;mg/100&amp;nbsp;g. Only fresh fruit has been shown to contain significant peonidin; frozen blueberries have been shown to contain almost none.  Peonidin has been found in concentrations of up to 40&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g (cooked) of certain cultivars of purple fleshed sweet potatoes; the amount of peonidin varies greatly across cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://fsweb2.schaub.ncsu.edu/usdaars/acrobatpubs/s114-150/s132.pdf |author1=Van-Den Truong |author2=Nigel Deighton |author3=Roger T.

The higher level of peonidin in fresh fruit corresponds to the rule of thumb that more natural fruit is healthier. Specifically, the amount of phenolic compounds in cranberries has been found to be inversely correlated with fruit size and crop yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=574_32 | journal = ISHS Acta Horticulturae | volume = 574: VII International Symposium on Vaccinium Culture | title = Evaluation Of Fruit Chemistry In Cranberry Germplasm: Potential For Breeding Varieties With Enhanced Health Constituents |author1=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3546">The biological activity of a '''pesticide''', be it chemical or biological in nature, is determined by its [[active ingredient]] (AI - also called the ''active substance''). [[Pesticide]] products very rarely consist of pure technical material. The AI is usually formulated with other materials and this is the product as sold, but it may be further diluted in use. Formulations improves the properties of a chemical for handling, storage, application and may substantially influence effectiveness and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, DA (1998) ''Chemistry and technology of agricultural formulations''. Kluwer Academic, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Formulation terminology follows a 2-letter convention: (''e.g.'' GR: granules) listed by [[CropLife International]] (formerly GIFAP then GCPF) in the ''Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types'' (Monograph 2); see: [http://www.croplife.org/view_document.aspx?docId=1281  download page] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}. Some manufacturers do not follow these industry standards, which can cause confusion for users.

==Water-miscible formulations==
[[File:Pesticide formulations.jpg|thumb|400px]]

By far the most frequently used products are formulations for mixing with water then applying as sprays.
Water miscible, older formulations include:
* EC	Emulsifiable concentrate
* WP	[[Wettable powder]]
* SL	Soluble (liquid) concentrate
* SP	Soluble powder

Newer, non-powdery formulations with reduced or no use of hazardous solvents and improved stability include:
* SC	Suspension concentrate
* CS	Capsule suspensions
* WG	Water dispersible granules

{{clear}}

==Other formulations==
Other common formulations include granules (GR) and dusts (DP), although for improved safety the latter have been replaced by microgranules (MG ''e.g''. for [[rice]] farmers in [[Japan]]).  Specialist formulations are available for [[ultra-low volume]] spraying, fogging, fumigation, ''etc''. Very occasionally, some pesticides (''e.g''. malathion) may be sold as technical material (TC - which is mostly AI, but also contains small quantities of, usually non-active, by-products of the manufacturing process).

A particularly efficient form of pesticide dose transfer is [[seed treatment]] and specific formulations have been developed for this purpose.  A number of pesticide [[bait (luring substance)|bait]] formulations are available for [[rodent]] pest control, ''etc''.

In reality many formulation codes are used: AB, AE, AL, AP, BB, BR, CB, CF, CG, CL, CP, CS, DC, DL, DP, DS, DT, EC, ED, EG, EO, ES, EW, FD, FG, FK, FP, FR, FS, FT, FU, FW, GA, GB, GE, GF, GG, GL, GP, GR, GS, GW, HN, KK, KL, KN, KP, LA, LS, LV, MC, ME, MG, MV, OD, OF, OL, OP, PA, PB, PC, PO, PR, PS, RB, SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, SG, SL, SO, SP, SS, ST, SU, TB, TC, TK, TP, UL, VP, WG, WP, WS, WT, XX, ZC, ZE and ZW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dropdata.org/IPARC_guide/Formulation_codes.pdf Formulation Codes] from dropdata.org, run by iparc.org.uk, The International Pesticide Application Research Consortium (IPARC), Department of Biology, Imperial College, London&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Private healthcare''' or '''private medicine''' is [[healthcare]] and [[medicine]] provided by entities other than the government. 

Ethical issues relating to private healthcare primarily concerns the argument that the seriously ill be entitled to spend money on saving their lives. On the other hand, private healthcare can sometimes be more efficient than public sector provision. Private operators may be more innovative in areas such as telemedicine. Due to the [[profit motive]], they can be more productive. The friendly behavior of staff and doctors are the main reason for people relying on private health care centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/friendly-service-modern-facilities-draw-people-to-private-healthcare-centres/article18734394.ece|title=Friendly service, modern facilities draw people to private healthcare centres|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charging patients or private insurers for work==
Europeans in all countries are willing to pay a charge for some private healthcare, whether to avoid long queues, to access cosmetic surgery, or to avoid the perceived risk of infection in public-sector hospitals. This is not a small market. In Finland, it is estimated that it is worth some €700m a year. In Greece, half the income of private hospitals is from one-off payments from patients. Maternity is a particularly large private market, as it is the demand for fertility both at home and abroad, where more than 18% of medical internet-based searches are related to infertility conditions and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allprivatehealth.com/&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare tourism is also thriving within the EU, in which patients (mainly from the UK) travel to Eastern Europe for low-cost dental work. The particularly wealthy Russians and Saudi Arabians tend to go to private hospitals in Switzerland or Germany.

As most Europeans have access to public sector provision either through their mandatory social insurance fund or through taxes, private healthcare insurance remains a relatively small market, with levels typically in the range of 2–8% of the population {{citation needed|reason=Source?|date=January 2016}}. Many consumers prefer to pay single fees as and when necessary. In addition, any occupational healthcare paid for by employers renders private healthcare insurance unnecessary. Nonetheless, around 10% of Germans have some form of private healthcare insurance which enables them to experience a slightly higher level of comfort during hospital stays{{citation needed|reason=Source?|date=January 2016}}. The most notable development in this area has been the Netherlands, which in 2005 moved to a system whereby all citizens are forced to take out private healthcare insurance rather than social insurance{{citation needed|reason=Source?|date=January 2016}}. This is being closely monitored by many European countries.

==Occupational healthcare==
In many European countries with a state-run national health service, employers are obliged to pay for some level of healthcare for their employees. This is the case in Romania, Poland, and Finland, for instance, and one can find networks of small clinics in large cities in these countries. In other countries, such as the UK and Sweden, many employers are willing to pay for occupational healthcare for their workforce so that key workers can avoid delays in seeing a doctor when they are unwell. Naturally, though, the occupational health department of a publicly funded hospital will provide a similar standard of healthcare to that provided for patients.

'''Protein combining''' (or '''protein complementing''') is a dietary theory for [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] nutrition that purports to optimize the [[biological value]] of protein intake. According to the theory, [[vegetarian]] and [[vegan]] diets may provide an insufficient amount of some [[essential amino acids]], making protein combining with multiple foods necessary to obtain a [[complete protein]]. The terms ''complete'' and ''incomplete'' are outdated in relation to plant protein. The position of the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] is that protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough of all essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melina|first=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|date=2016-12-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31192-3/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1971|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|issn=2212-2672|pmid=27886704|via=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of protein combining has been discredited by major health organizations. Studies on essential amino acid contents in plant proteins has shown that vegetarians and vegans do not actually need to complement plant proteins in each meal to reach the desired level of essential amino acids as long as their diets are varied and caloric requirements are met.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=V.

==Concept==
Protein nutrition is complex because any [[proteinogenic amino acid]] may be the [[limiting factor]] in [[metabolism]]. Mixing [[livestock feed]]s can optimize for growth, or minimize cost while maintaining adequate growth. Similarly, [[human nutrition]] is subject to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]]: The lowest level of one of the essential amino acids will be the limiting factor in metabolism.
:If the content of a single indispensable amino acid in the diet is less than the individual’s requirement, then it will limit the utilization of other amino acids and thus prevent the normal rates of synthesis even when the total nitrogen intake level is adequate. Thus the "limiting amino acid" will determine the nutritional value of the total nitrogen or protein in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board of [[Institute of Medicine]] (2005) ''Dietary Reference Intakes for'' [http://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12 Protein and Amino Acids], page 685, from [[National Academies Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants are thus rated as protein sources by their limiting amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S–1212S | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.long | format = PDF |  id= | pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of "limiting" amino acids in plant protein ===
According to WHO, human need for proteins is 0.66 g per kg of bodyweight per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joint WHO/FAO/UNU Expert Consultation|first=|date=2007|title=Protein and amino acid requirements in human nutrition|journal=World Health Organization Technical Report Series|volume=|issue=935|pages=pag 88 – table 4|issn=0512-3054|pmid=18330140|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43411/1/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So a 70&amp;nbsp;kg person has an estimated protein requirement of 46.2g (70&amp;nbsp;kg x 0,66 g/kg).

In addition, there is a specific need of essential amino acids quantities, thereby written in the table.

In the above example, the combination of both whole rice and canned chickpeas has no limiting amino acids, that means that only consuming rice and chickpeas, in these specific quantities of 306g/day and 261g/day respectively, for long periods of time, would not result in any of the essential amino acid deficiency.

As the data of the example show, all essential amino acids are found in a specific plant, however one of them may or may not be 'limiting', that is, present in quantities below the WHO daily recommendation.
For this reasons vegan and vegetarian diets need to be varied in terms of plants consumed.

==Plant protein research==
The first biochemist to enter the field was [[Karl Heinrich Ritthausen]], a student of [[Justus von Liebig]]. [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Burr Osborne]] continued what Ritthausen started and published ''The Vegetable Proteins'' in 1909. Thus [[Yale University]] was the early center of protein nutrition, where [[William Cumming Rose]] was a student. Osborne also worked to determine the essentials, and later led the [[Biochemistry]] Department at the [[University of Chicago]].

When Ritthausen died in 1912, Osborne praised his efforts in biochemistry:
:As a result of his later work he proved that wide differences exist between different food proteins; and he was the first to direct attention to this fact, and to discuss its probable bearing on their relative value in nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Osborne, Thomas Burr]] (1913) "In Memoriam: Heinrich Ritthausen", ''Biochemical Bulletin'' 2:338, published by the [[Columbia University]] Biochemical Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne then joined forces with [[Lafayette Mendel]] at the [[Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station]] to determine the [[essential amino acid]]s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Nevin S. Scrimshaw]] took this knowledge to India and Guatemala. He designed meals using local vegetables to fight against the scourge of [[kwashiorkor]]. In Guatemala he used the combination of cottonseed flour with maize, while in India he combined peanut flour with wheat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/nevin-s-scrimshaw-obituary-0211.html Scrimshaw obituary] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Adelle Davis]] published ''Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit'', which described the importance of combining "incomplete" proteins to make "complete" proteins, and advised that any incomplete proteins not complemented within one hour could not be used by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Adelle|title=Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit|date=1954|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|isbn=4-87187-961-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Frances Moore Lappé]] published ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'', which explained how essential amino acids might be obtained from complementary sources in [[vegetarian nutrition]]. The book became a [[bestseller]] :
:An extension of a one-page handout that Lappé had circulated among her fellow improvisors in Berkeley, ''Diet for a Small Planet'' (1971) soon became ''the'' vegetarian text of the [[ecology movement]], selling in the next ten years almost two million copies in three editions and six languages.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Belasco (1989) ''Appetite for Change: how the counterculture took on the food industry 1966 — 1988'', page 56, [[Pantheon Books]] {{ISBN|0394543998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lappé wrote:
:Complementary protein combinations make for delicious [[recipe]]s – they are combinations that formed the basis of the world’s traditional [[cuisine]]s. We use them naturally in our cooking without even being aware of it. The three most common complementary protein combinations are:
:#Grains (rice, corn, wheat, barley, etc.) + legumes (peas, beans, lentils)
:#Grains and milk products
:#Seeds (Sesame or sunflower) +legumes&lt;ref name=FML&gt;[[Frances Moore Lappé|Lappé, Frances Moore]] (1981) ''Diet for a Small Planet'', {{ISBN|0-345-32120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}

In 1975, both [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] and [[American Journal of Nursing]] carried articles describing the principles and practice of protein combining.&lt;ref&gt;Judith S. Stern (1975) "How to stay well on a vegetarian diet and save money too!", [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] 165(2):150,1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor R. Williams (1975) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3423700 Making Vegetarian Diets Nutritious], [[American Journal of Nursing]] 75(12):2168–73 from [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
For a time, 
The [[United States National Research Council|American National Research Council]] and the [[American Dietetic Association]] (ADA) cautioned vegetarians to be sure to combine their proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, Donna. (2002). Vegetarianism: Movement or Moment? Philadelphia: Temple University Press. {{ISBN|1-56639-936-X}}. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the principle of protein combining was explained by J. Rigó:
:The [[biological value]] of proteins in general, hence also of grain-proteins, is fundamentally determined by the ratio between the essential amino acids to be found in [[cereal]]s and the requirement of essential amino acids of the living creature, consuming protein...the most important way of raising the biological value ... [is] given by the technique of complementing.&lt;ref&gt;Rigó, J. (1985) "Nutritional Functions of Cereals", in ''Amino Acid Composition and Biological Value of Cereal'', Radomir Lásztity &amp; Máté Hidvégi editors, [[International Association for Cereal Chemistry]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[PLOS ONE]]published an article investigating the specifics of protein combining for 1251 plant-based foods. The bases of reference are the amino acids indispensable to human nutrition, and the ideal proportioning of these amino acids in a meal. They explain, "complementation involves consuming two or more foods together to yield an amino acid pattern that is better than the sum of the two foods alone."&lt;ref name=FW&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Woolf | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Fu | first2 = L. L. | last3 = Basu | first3 = A. | editor1-last = Haslam | editor1-first = Niall James | title = VProtein: Identifying Optimal Amino Acid Complements from Plant-Based Foods | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018836 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = e18836 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21526128 | pmc =3081312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to pairings based on food groups, such as pairing a grain with a bean, the investigators reported that pairing by food group was not supported by their work: "Examining the top 100 pairings for each food, we found no consistent pattern of food group-food group pairings."&lt;ref name=FW/&gt;

==Criticism==

Protein combining has drawn criticism as an unnecessary complicating factor in [[nutrition]].

In 1981,    [[Frances Moore Lappé]] changed her position on protein combining from a decade prior in a revised edition of  ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' in which she wrote:

:"In 1971 I stressed protein complementarity because I assumed that the only way to get enough protein ... was to create a protein as usable by the body as animal protein. In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get high-quality protein, I reinforced another myth. I gave the impression that in order to get enough protein without meat, considerable care was needed in choosing foods. Actually, it is much easier than I thought.

:"With three important exceptions, there is little danger of protein deficiency in a plant food diet. The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on [1] [[fruit]] or on [2] some tubers, such as [[sweet potato]]es or [[cassava]], or on [3] [[junk food]] (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively few people in the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories. In all other diets, if people are getting enough calories, they are virtually certain of getting enough protein."&lt;ref name=FML/&gt;{{rp|162}}

Necessity of protein combining was not asserted. Rather, the increased [[biological value]] of meals where proteins are combined was noted. In a concession, Lappé removed from the second edition "charts that indicate exact proportions of complementary proteins".&lt;ref name=FML/&gt;{{rp|239}}

The American Dietetic Association reversed itself in its 1988 position paper on vegetarianism. Suzanne Havala, the primary author of the paper, recalls the research process:
:There was no basis for [protein combining] that I could see.... I began calling around and talking to people and asking them what the justification was for saying that you had to complement proteins, and there was none. And what I got instead was some interesting insight from people who were knowledgeable and actually felt that there was probably no need to complement proteins. So we went ahead and made that change in the paper.  [Note: The paper was approved by peer review and by a delegation vote before becoming official.]

In 1994, Vernon Young and Peter Pellett published their paper that became the definitive contemporary guide to protein metabolism in humans. It also confirmed that complementing proteins at meals was totally unnecessary. Thus, people who avoid consuming animal protein do not need to be at all concerned about amino acid imbalances from the plant proteins that make up their usual diets.&lt;ref name="VRYoung"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S–1212S | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.long| pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many plant proteins are lower in one or more essential amino acids than animal proteins, especially [[lysine]], and to a lesser extent [[methionine]] and [[threonine]], eating a variety of plants can serve as a well-balanced and complete source of amino acids.&lt;ref name="VRYoung" /&gt;

Pediatrician [[Charles R. Attwood]] wrote, "The old ideas about the necessity of carefully combining vegetables at every meal to ensure the supply of essential amino acids has been totally refuted."&lt;ref&gt;Attwood, Charles R. [http://www.vegsource.com/attwood/complete_protein.htm "Complete" Proteins?], VegSource.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[John A. McDougall|Dr. John McDougall]] wrote a correction to the American Heart Association for a 2001 publication that questioned the completeness of plant proteins, and further asserted that "it is impossible to design an amino acid–deficient diet based on the amounts of unprocessed starches and vegetables sufficient to meet the calorie needs of humans."&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDougall|first1=J|title=Plant foods have a complete amino acid composition|journal=Circulation|date=25 Jun 2002|volume=105|issue=25|page=:e197|pmid=12082008|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000018905.97677.1F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Dr. [[Andrew Weil]] wrote that "you don’t have to worry that you won’t get enough usable protein if you don’t put together some magical combination of foods at each meal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA142995 Vegetarians: Pondering Protein?], DrWeil.com, Dec. 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Healthy Times'' Jeff Novick wrote that the necessity of protein combining is a "myth that won’t go away".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/diet-myths-complementary-protein-myth-wont-go-away.html Complementary Protein Myth Won't Go Away!],
Jeff Novick, M.S., R.D., ''Healthy Times'' (May 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Dr. [[Joel Fuhrman]] wrote:
:...plant foods have plenty of protein and you do not have to be a nutritional scientist or dietitian to figure out what to eat and you don’t need to mix and match foods to achieve protein completeness.  Any combination of natural foods will supply you with adequate protein, including all eight essential amino acids as well as unessential amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuhrman|first1=Joel|title=Eat to Live|date=2005|publisher=Little Brown|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[T. Colin Campbell]] wrote in 2006:
:We now know that through enormously complex metabolic systems, the human body can derive all the essential amino acids from the natural variety of plant proteins that we encounter every day. It doesn’t require eating higher quantities of plant protein or meticulously planning every meal.&lt;ref name="ChinaStudy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=T. Colin|last2=Campbell|first2=Thomas M.|title=The China Study|date=2006|publisher=BenBella Books|isbn=1935251007|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|American Dietetic Association]] wrote: 
:Plant protein can meet protein requirements when a variety of plant foods is consumed and energy needs are met. Research indicates that an assortment of plant foods eaten over the course of a day can provide all essential amino acids and ensure adequate nitrogen retention and use in healthy adults, thus, complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=July 2009|volume=109|issue=7|pages=1267–1268|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/2009_ADA_position_paper.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027|pmid=19562864 | last1 = Craig | first1 = WJ | last2 = Mangels | first2 = AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Heart Association now states:
:You don’t need to eat foods from animals to have enough protein in your diet. Plant proteins alone can provide enough of the essential and non-essential amino acids, as long as sources of dietary protein are varied and caloric intake is high enough to meet energy needs. Whole grains, legumes, vegetables, seeds and nuts all contain both essential and non-essential amino acids. You don’t need to consciously combine these foods (“complementary proteins”) within a given meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vegetarian, Vegan Diet &amp; Heart Health|url=https://www.goredforwomen.org/live-healthy/first-steps-to-prevent-heart-disease-and-be-heart-healthy/vegetarian-vegan-diet-heart-health/|website=Go Red For Women|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=13 January 2017|ref=GoRed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some institutions use the [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] to assess diets without consideration of protein combining and hence find the use of combinations to be a challenge to their methodology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The '''reasonable person model''' ('''RPM''') is a psychological framework which argues that people are at their best when their informational needs are met. Positing that unreasonableness is not a human trait, but rather the result of environment (context and circumstances), the RPM attempts to define the environments/actions that foster reasonableness,  defining three key areas that assist with this: model building, being effective, and meaningful action.

The RPM was developed by environmental psychologists [[Rachel and Stephen Kaplan|Stephen and Rachel Kaplan]] and integrates principles from [[environmental psychology|environmental]], [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Reasonable Person Model Diagram 2.png|alt=RPM Diagram|thumb|RPM diagram (&amp;copy; 2011, Rachel Kaplan)]]
The RPM is a psychological framework that posits human functioning is improved when the following three domains of informational needs are met:&lt;ref name="Kaplan2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01010.x | volume = 22 | pages = 826–829 | last = Kaplan | first = Rachel | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Stephen | title = Bringing out the best in people: A psychological perspective | journal = Conservation Biology | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Model building''' –  RPM posits that a central informational need is to build [[mental model]]s (also known as [[cognitive map]]s) in order to function effectively in the world. It suggests that mental models help people recognize objects and circumstances, predict and evaluate possible future outcomes and decide on actions.
* '''Being effective''' – This focuses on helping people utilize knowledge effectively by developing the necessary skills, also maintaining a clear head in order to function effectively.
* '''Meaningful action''' – RPM suggests that people wish to use their skills to make a difference, meaning they wish to be listened to and be given opportunities to participate.

RPM states that an environment or context supportive of informational needs can foster reasonable behavior that will "bring out the best in people".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2008"/&gt;

==Conceptualizing reasonableness==
The use of the term ''reasonable'' in RPM has commonalities and differences with the colloquial use of the word. In RPM, reasonableness refers to the ways in which "one would hope people behave".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 56 | pages = 491–508 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | title = Human nature and environmentally responsible behavior | journal = Journal of Social Issues | date = 2000 | doi = 10.1111/0022-4537.00180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is partially conveyed by what it is not, unreasonable states such as incivility, aggression, irritability and impatience. Examples may also include "...demanding fairness for oneself while denying it to others, displaying intolerance and disrespect for others, willingness to harm or kill because of differences in beliefs, and attempting to extract the earth’s resources for personal gain without regard for the needs of future generations".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2009"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jenvp.2008.10.005 | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 329–339 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Rachel | title = Creating a larger role for environmental psychology: The Reasonable Person Model as an integrative framework | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison to theories on rationality ===
The RPM may be viewed as a contrary theory to [[Homo economicus|rational man theory]] (also known as [[Homo economicus|Homo Economicus]]) or related [[rational choice theory]], in that it describes a landscape of mutual dependencies, such as the manner in which people treat one another. RPM assumes that information is often misunderstood, overwhelming, and unavailable. It also assumes that people are not interested in maximizing personal gain, but rather [[satisficing]]. RPM further asserts that people often have multiple concerns which cannot be reduced to a single monetary value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cornell University Press | last = Midgley | first = Mary | title = Beast and Man: Roots of Human Nature | date = 1978 |isbn = 0203626508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison to subjective well-being ===
Reasonableness shares some themes with [[subjective well-being]], including emphasis on positive/negative affect and quality of life. However, whereas SWB addresses self-directed feelings, RPM also considers the contexts that foster civil behavior and improve relationships between people.&lt;ref name="Basu2014"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Edward Elgar | editors = Timo J. Hämäläinen, Juliet Michaelson | last = Basu | first = Avik | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Rachel | last3 = Kaplan | first3 = Stephen | title = Well-Being and Beyond: Broadening the Public and Policy Discourse | chapter = Creating supportive environments to foster reasonableness and achieve sustainable well-being | location = Cheltenham, United Kingdom | series = New Horizons in Management Series| date = 2014 | isbn = 9781783472895 | doi = 10.4337/9781783472901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model building==
The world, as [[William James]] described it, is a "blooming buzzing confusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Principles of Psychology|last = James|first = William|publisher = Dover|year = 1890|isbn = 0-486-20381-6|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mental models are neural structures, made of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s, that organize our experiences into a usable form and allow us to
#[[Object Recognition in Cognitive Neuroscience|recognize objects]], situations, and other patterns,
#predict possible future outcomes,
#evaluate those outcomes offline, and
#take appropriate action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Aldine | pages = 63–78 | editors = R. M. Downs, D. Stea (eds.) | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | title = Image and Environment | chapter = Cognitive maps in perception and thought | location = Chicago, IL | date = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, [[Kenneth Craik]] described these affordances:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the organism carries a “small-scale model” of external reality and of its own possible actions within its head, it is able to try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situations before they arise, utilize the knowledge of past events in dealing with the present and future, and in every way to react in a much fuller, easier, and more competent manner to the emergencies which face it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of Explanation|last = Craik|first = Kenneth J. W.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1943|isbn = 9780521094450|location = London|pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mechanisms of model building ===
Mental models are built through repetition, variation, and association. Experiencing something multiple times is said to lead to an [[Mental representation|internal representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Ulrich's Press | isbn = 0030623448 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Rachel | title = Cognition and environment: functioning in an uncertain world | location = Ann Arbor, MI | date = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing sequences of things [[Association (psychology)|associates]] our internal representations in a mental map according to how those things occur in reality. [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb's]] [[Hebbian theory|rule]] put it as: Things that fire together, wire together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Organization of Behavior|last = Hebb|first = Donald O.|publisher =Wiley &amp; Sons |year =1949 |isbn = |location =New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Being effective==
This refers to the skills needed over and above basic knowledge to accomplish goals and refers to a state of mind that is capable of attending to and managing information. Lack of clearheadedness is described within [[attention restoration theory]], which states there are two attentional systems: one for attending to naturally fascinating stimuli and another that allows us to intentionally direct our attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = |title = The restorative benefits of nature: toward an integrative frame-work |last = Kaplan|first = Stephen|date = 1995|journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/0272-4944(95)90001-2|pmid = |volume = 15|pages = 169–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Louv]]'s notion of [[nature deficit disorder]] describes some of the symptoms associated with a younger generation who do not spend time outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Last Child in the Woods|last = Louv|first = Richard|publisher =Algonquin Books |year =2005 |isbn =9781565126053 |location =Chapel Hill |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaningful action==
RPM's third domain argues that people have a desire to use their knowledge and skills to make a difference. Fewer people have work that is directly connected to their survival yet the evolutionary desire to make a difference remains. The inability to do so can lead to [[learned helplessness]] and feeling hopeless and alone in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.  Such a state is not amenable to effective human functioning, yet there continues to be, as Kaplan describes, a "pervasive malaise of helplessness".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2000" /&gt; Goldschmidt described what he termed The Human Career as: one in which humans are primarily seeking the respect of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Human Career: The self in the symbolic world|last = Goldschmidt|first = Walter|authorlink1=Walter Goldschmidt|publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1990|isbn = |location = Cambridge, MA, USA|pages = |publication-place = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that, in participatory contexts, the most effective strategies are ones that help people feel like they can make a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Environmental Locus of Control, Sympathy, and Proenvironmental Behavior A Test of Geller’s Actively Caring Hypothesis|last = Allen|first = James B.|date = 1999|journal = Environment and Behavior|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/00139169921972137|pmid = |last2 = Ferrand|first2 = Jennifer L.|volume = 31|issue = 3|pages = 338–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
RPM has been applied to the following domains:

The '''Rede São Paulo Saudável''' (''Healthy São Paulo Network'', in [[Portuguese language]]) is a [[satellite]]-based [[digital TV]] [[corporate video|corporate channel]], developed by the Municipal Health Secretary of [[São Paulo]], with the goal of bringing programs focused on [[health promotion]] and [[health education]], which may be watched by the entire population seeking [[health care]] in its units in the city. The network consists of two complete [[TV studio]]s, and a system for transmission of closed [[digital video]] in [[high-definition television|high definition]] via [[satellite]], with about 1,400 points of reception in all health care units of the municipality of São Paulo, including its more than 700 public health care centers and posts, medical [[clinic]]s, and 17 [[hospital]]s.

==Channel line-up==

The TV network has currently three active channels.

The first channel (the ''Citizenship Channel'') is devoted to the [[broadcast]]ing of [[health education]] directly to the population in the waiting rooms of the units. Currently more than 400 short- and medium-length TV programs with this content are part of its grid.

The second channel (the ''Professional Education Channel'') has the aim of providing [[continuing education]] and [[training]] programs to Health Secretary professionals, such as [[physician]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[social worker]]s, etc., through [[distance education]]. The reception points for this channel are located in meeting rooms or [[classrooms]] inside the basic health units and hospitals.

The third channel (the "Administrative Channel") is interactive, and serves for [[meeting]]s and for corporate communication with [[Management|managers]] in general, as well as for the transmission of courses in real time. The interaction is accomplished by a [[online chat|chat]] interface, through the Internet connection of each unit, since the TV channel is unidirectional (broadcasting).

Each reception room for channels 1 and 2 has a 39" [[LCD TV]] and a digital satellite [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] conencted to an externally placed [[satellite dish]]. Channel 3 is received directly in a PC [[microcomputer]] in the administrative offices.

==Distance Education==

Several distance education courses for doctors, nurses and other health professionals are already in the air, and are freely available for the 54,000 employees of the Secretary. The courses consist or prerecorded or real time video transmissions according to a program grid, and of a public [[WWW]] site for off-class support using a [[Learning Management System]] (LMS).

The [[Centro de Formação e Desenvolvimento dos Trabalhadores da Saúde de São Paulo]] (CEFOR-SP) (''Center for Buildup and Development of Healthcare Workers'' (CEFOR-SP) and the centers for research and education of several hospitals of the public health network of São Paulo, such as the [[Hospital do Servidor Publico Municipal de São Paulo]] (''Hospital of the Public Servant of São Paulo'') are among the institutions which create and provide certification of educational content. The Healthy São Paulo Network is managed by the Technical Department of Information Technology and the Educational Technology Group of CEFOR-SP.

==Technology==

The Healthy São Paulo Network uses [[IP TV]] through [[multicasting]] via [[satellite]], using the [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] standard. The default compression used is [[H.264]] [[MPEG 4]], with a total [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of 20 Mbit/s for the 3 channels. The São Paulo company [[SpeedCast]] is responsible for the operation of the system and for providing the [[satellite space segment]], with its [[satellite hub]] located in the city of [[Barueri]]. A virtual platform to support [[teaching]] and [[learning]] uses the  [[Moodle]] [[learning management system]] (LMS), hosted in a [[virtual dedicated server]] operated by the state company [[PRODAM]] and developed by the [[Edumed Institute for Education in Medicine and Health]].

===Television studios===

The network has two complete [[TV studio]]s, a smaller one located at the central administrative center of the Secretary of Health, in downtown São Paulo, and another, with a full [[auditorium]] with 90 seats, located at CEFOR-SP, in the neighbourhood of Moema. The studios are equipped with [[robotic camera]]s, [[document camera]]s, [[smartboard]]s, computers for presentation of slides, [[teleprompter]]s, and control desks with [[video switcher]]s, [[audio mixer]] and [[DVD]] recording capabilities

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3300">'''Remote guidance''', in the medical context, refers to the supervision or guidance of a medical task, usually a procedures or test, from a remote location.  This falls in the realm of [[Real-time computing|real time]] [[telemedicine]] applications.  By way of example, a [[radiologist]] may guide an [[ultrasound]] examination from a remote location.  As such the proximate requisite expertise to accomplish a medical task is significantly diminished.  In the previous example, a diagnostic quality ultrasound can be accomplished by non-medically trained individuals manipulating an ultrasound device located with the patient under guidance from a remote location.   This is an example of [[teleradiology]] If appropriately configured, the remote guidance can originate from another room or floor in the same building, to as far away as another continent or even planet.  [[NASA]] researchers have successfully demonstrated remote guidance of diagnostic level [[cardiac ultrasonography]] using an ultrasound on the space station, non-medical astronauts performing the exam  as guided by a terrestrially located expert.

== Remote diagnostics ==

Remote diagnostics refers to a real time [[telemedical]] application which achieves [[diagnostic]] level quality and information exchange.  In this sense, it refers to an expectation for quality sufficient for making or excluding a [[medical diagnosis]].  In the tele-medical context specific to radiologic images these images often are consistent with the [[DICOM]] standard.  Given bandwidth issues universally plaguing the healthcare environment imagery beyond still images and brief video has not yet become standard expectation of care environments or [[Picture Archiving and Communication System|PACS]] systems.  Ultrasound scanning commonly utilized for [[abdomen]], [[musculoskeletal]], [[human pelvis|pelvis]], [[gynecologic]], [[human heart|cardiac]] and [[vascular]] evaluations has shown potential for remote diagnosis only of late.

More general [[Remote diagnostics|Remote Diagnostics]] (RD) refers to detecting which fault or faults are present in a system, body of object, from a distance. Examples of use: aeroplanes, spacecraft, Formula 1 and major assets such as ships, trains etc. In cases where corrective actions are also made, the term 'Remote Diagnostic &amp; Maintenance' is more appropriate.

== Technical aspects ==

While still imagery can be e-mailed and forwarded in a multitude of methods, video product of medical devices has typically not been available for remote interaction.  Recent improvements in scanning devices, for example ultrasound machines has facilitated this new capability.  The inclusion of the [[VGA]] output gives the opportunity for [[frame grabber]] devices to stream such outputs to the internet.

'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]] that vary amongst countries around the world.&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2950752 |jstor=2950752 |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=115–21 |year=1996 |last1=Cook |first1=Rebecca J. |last2=Fathalla |first2=Mahmoud F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726150133/http://www.who.int//reproductive-health/gender/index.html |archivedate=2009-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women's reproductive rights may include some or all of the following: the [[abortion-rights movements|right to legal and safe abortion]]; the right to [[birth control]]; freedom from [[compulsory sterilization|coerced sterilization]] and contraception; the right to access good-quality [[reproductive health]]care; and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make free and informed reproductive choices.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt; Reproductive rights may also include the right to receive [[sex education|education]] about [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] and other aspects of sexuality, and protection from practices such as [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html|title=Template|website=Nocirc.org|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights began to develop as a subset of [[human rights]] at the United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt; The resulting [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] Proclamation of Tehran was the first international document to recognize one of these rights when it stated that: "Parents have a basic human right to determine [[Political freedom|freely]] and [[Moral responsibility|responsibly]] the number and the spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2939211 |pmid=8475521 |jstor=2939211 |title=Human Rights and Reproductive Choice |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–30 |year=1993 |last1=Freedman |first1=Lynn P. |last2=Isaacs |first2=Stephen L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teheran_proc&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclamation of Teheran|publisher=International Conference on Human Rights|year= 1968|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm|accessdate=2007-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017025912/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; States, though, have been slow in incorporating these rights in [[treaty|internationally legally binding instruments]]. Thus, while some of these rights have already been recognized in [[soft law|hard law]], that is, in legally binding [[international human rights instruments]], others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and, therefore, have at best the status of [[soft law]] in [[international law]], while a further group is yet to be accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of [[advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003):&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have been leaders in bringing arguments for a woman's right to choose abortion within the rubric of international human rights. However, there is no binding hard norm that recognizes women's right to terminate a pregnancy. (...) While there are hard norms prohibiting sex discrimination that apply to girl adolescents, these are problematic since they must be applied to a substantive right (i.e., the right to health) and the substantive reproductive rights of adolescents are not `hard' (yet!). There are no hard norms on age discrimination that would protect adolescents' ability to exercise their rights to reproductive health, sexual education, or reproductive decisionmaking. In addition, there are no hard norms prohibiting discrimination based on marital status, which is often an issue with respect to unmarried adolescents' access to reproductive health services and information. The soft norms support the idea that the hard norms apply to adolescents under 18. They also fill in the substantive gaps in the hard norms with respect to reproductive health services and information as well as adolescents' reproductive autonomy. (...) There are no hard norms in international human rights law that directly address HIV/AIDS directly. At the same time, a number of human rights bodies have developed soft norms to secure rights that are rendered vulnerable by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (...) Practices with implications for women's reproductive rights in relation to HIV/AIDS are still not fully covered under existing international law, although soft norms have addressed them to some extent. (...) There is a lack of explicit prohibition of mandatory testing of HIV-positive pregnant women under international law. (...) None of the global human rights treaties explicitly prohibit child marriage and no treaty prescribes an appropriate minimum age for marriage. The onus of specifying a minimum age at marriage rests with the states' parties to these treaties. (...) We have to rely extensively on soft norms that have evolved from the TMBs and that are contained in conference documents to assert that child marriage is a violation of fundamental human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues related to reproductive rights are some of the most vigorously contested rights' issues worldwide, regardless of the population's [[socioeconomic]] level, [[religion]] or [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of reproductive rights is frequently presented as being of vital importance in discussions and articles by [[List of population concern organizations|population concern organizations]] such as [[Population Matters]].&lt;ref name=popsearch&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Matters search on "reproductive rights"|url=http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140627121618/http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-06-27|website=Populationmatters.org/|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights are a subset of [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]].

==History==
===Proclamation of Tehran===
In 1945, the [[United Nations Charter]] included the obligation "to promote... universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race, sex, language, or religion". However, the Charter did not define these rights. Three years later, the [[United Nations|UN]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first international legal document to delineate [[human rights]]; the UDHR does not mention reproductive rights.  Reproductive rights began to appear as a subset of human rights in the 1968 Proclamation of Tehran, which states: "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children".&lt;ref name=tehran_proc /&gt;

This right was affirmed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in the 1969 [[Declaration on Social Progress and Development]] which states "The family as a basic unit of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members, particularly children and youth, should be assisted and protected so that it may fully assume its responsibilities within the community. Parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/m_progre.htm|title=unhchr.ch|website=Unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Women's Year#International|1975 UN International Women's Year Conference]] echoed the Proclamation of Tehran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Cairo Programme of Action===
The twenty-year "Cairo Programme of Action" was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. The [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]] Programme of Action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. It recommended that [[family planning]] services be provided in the context of other reproductive health services, including services for healthy and safe childbirth, care for sexually transmitted infections, and post-abortion care. The ICPD also addressed issues such as [[violence against women]], [[sex trafficking]], and adolescent health.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=5–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cairo Program is the first international policy document to define [[reproductive health]],&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant [para. 72].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike previous population conferences, a wide range of interests from grassroots to government level were represented in Cairo. 179 nations attended the ICPD and overall eleven thousand representatives from governments, [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]], international agencies and citizen activists participated.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; The ICPD did not address the far-reaching implications of the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. In 1999, recommendations at the ICPD+5 were expanded to include commitment to AIDS education, research, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, as well as to the development of vaccines and microbicides.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cairo Programme of Action was adopted by 184 UN member states. Nevertheless, many Latin American and Islamic states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] to the programme, in particular, to its concept of reproductive rights and sexual freedom, to its treatment of abortion, and to its potential incompatibility with [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html|title=A/CONF.171/13: Report of the ICPD (94/10/18) (385k)|website=Un.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action varies considerably from country to country. In many countries, post-ICPD tensions emerged as the [[human rights]]-based approach was implemented. Since the ICPD, many countries have broadened their reproductive health programs and attempted to integrate maternal and child health services with family planning. More attention is paid to adolescent health and the consequences of unsafe abortion. Lara Knudsen observes that the ICPD succeeded in getting [[feminist]] language into governments' and population agencies' literature, but in many countries the underlying concepts are not widely put into practice.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"/&gt; In two preparatory meetings for the ICPD+10 in Asia and Latin America, the United States, under the George W. Bush Administration, was the only nation opposing the ICPD's Programme of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beijing Platform===
The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, in its [[non-binding resolution|non-binding]] [[Beijing Declaration|Declaration]] and [[Beijing Platform for Action|Platform for Action]], supported the Cairo Programme's definition of reproductive health, but established a broader context of reproductive rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences [para. 96].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Beijing Platform demarcated twelve interrelated critical areas of the human rights of women that require advocacy. The Platform framed women's reproductive rights as "indivisible, universal and inalienable human rights."&lt;ref name="BUNCH"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/495143 |jstor=3175048 |title=Beijing '95: Moving Women's Human Rights from Margin to Center |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=200–4 |year=1996 |last1=Bunch |first1=Charlotte |last2=Fried |first2=Susana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yogyakarta Principles===
The [[Yogyakarta Principles]] on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, proposed by a group of experts in November 2006&lt;ref name=YOGYABOUT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_about.htm|title=About the Yogyakarta Principles|website=Yogyakartaprinciples.org|accessdate=2017-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122237/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_about.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not yet incorporated by States in international law,&lt;ref&gt;International Service for Human Rights, [http://www.ishr.ch/archive-general-assembly/933-majority-of-ga-third-committee-unable-to-accept-report-on-the-human-right-to-sexual-education Majority of GA Third Committee unable to accept report on the human right to sexual education ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515111556/http://www.ishr.ch/archive-general-assembly/933-majority-of-ga-third-committee-unable-to-accept-report-on-the-human-right-to-sexual-education |date=2013-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; declares in its Preamble that "the [[international community]] has recognized the rights of persons to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free from coercion, discrimination, and violence." In relation to reproductive health, Principle 9 on "The Right to Treatment with Humanity while in Detention" requires that "States shall... &lt;nowiki&gt;[p]rovide&lt;/nowiki&gt; adequate access to medical care and counseling appropriate to the needs of those in custody, recognizing any particular needs of persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including with regard to reproductive health, access to [[HIV/AIDS]] information and therapy and access to [[hormone therapy|hormonal]] or other therapy as well as to [[sex reassignment therapy|gender-reassignment treatments]] where desired."&lt;ref&gt;"The Yogyakarta Principles" Preamble and Principle 9. The Rights to Treatment with Humanity While in Detention&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, African, Caribbean and Islamic Countries, as well as the [[Russian Federation]], have objected to the use of these principles as Human Rights standards.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Official Records, Third Committee, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement Summary record of the 29th meeting held in New York, on Monday, 25 October 2010, at 3 p.m] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927135721/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement |date=27 September 2012 }}. For instance, [[Malawi]], speaking on behalf of all African States, argued that the Yogyakarta Principles were "controversial and unrecognized," while the representative of the Russian Federation said that they "had not been agreed to at the intergovernmental level, and which therefore could not be considered as authoritative expressions of the opinion of the international community" (para. 9, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

===State abuses===
State abuses against reproductive rights have happened both under right-wing and left-wing governments. Such abuses include attempts to forcefully increase the birth rate - one of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century was that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people - as well as attempts to decrease the fertility rate - [[China]]'s [[one child policy]] (1978-2015). State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments have implemented [[eugenic]] policies of [[forced sterilizations]] of 'undesirable' population groups.

Since most existing legally binding [[international human rights instruments]] do not explicitly mention sexual and reproductive rights, a [[Epistemic community (international relations)|broad coalition]] of NGOs, civil servants, and experts working in [[international organizations]] have been promoting a reinterpretation of those instruments to link the realization of the already internationally recognized human rights with the realization of reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders Defenders of Sexual and Reproductive Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002004052/http://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders |date=2013-10-02 }}; [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3326&amp;Itemid=548 International Women’s Health Coalition and the United Nations],  [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=205&amp;Itemid=110 Campaign for an Inter-American Convention on Sexual and Reproductive Rights ], Women's Health Collection, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=105915323 Abortion as a human right: possible strategies in unexplored territory.

In this regard, the Center for Reproductive Rights has noted that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Our goal is to ensure that governments worldwide guarantee women's reproductive rights out of an understanding that they are bound to do so. The two principal prerequisites for achieving this goal are: (1) the strengthening of international legal norms protecting reproductive rights; and (2) consistent and effective action on the part of civil society and the international community to enforce these norms. Each of these conditions, in turn, depends upon profound social change at the local, national and international (including regional) levels. (...) Ultimately, we must persuade governments to accept reproductive rights as binding norms. Again, our approach can move forward on several fronts, with interventions both at the national and international levels. Governments' recognition of reproductive rights norms may be indicated by their support for progressive language in international conference documents or by their adoption and implementation of appropriate national-level legislative and policy instruments. In order to counter opposition to an expansion of recognized reproductive rights norms, we have questioned the credibility of such reactionary yet influential international actors as the United States and the Holy See. Our activities to garner support for international protections of reproductive rights include: Lobbying government delegations at UN conferences and producing supporting analyses/materials; fostering alliances with members of civil society who may become influential on their national delegations to the UN; and preparing briefing papers and factsheets exposing the broad anti-woman agenda of our opposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this linkage is provided by the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other relevant United Nations consensus documents. These rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence as expressed in human rights documents. In the exercise of this right, they should take into account the needs of their living and future children and their responsibilities towards the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/Cairo/program/p07002.html |title=[programme&amp;#93; Basis for action |publisher=Iisd.ca |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Amnesty International]] has argued that the realisation of reproductive rights is linked with the realisation of a series of recognised [[human rights]], including the [[right to health]], the right to freedom from [[discrimination]], the [[right to privacy]], and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=2007-12-08 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120140923/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[World Health Organization]] states that:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/srh-rights-comment/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Sexual and reproductive health and rights encompass efforts to eliminate preventable maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, to ensure quality sexual and reproductive health services, including contraceptive services, and to address sexually transmitted infections (STI) and cervical cancer, violence against women and girls, and sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health is essential not only to achieve sustainable development but also to ensure that this new framework speaks to the needs and aspirations of people around the world and leads to realisation of their health and human rights."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, not all states have accepted the inclusion of reproductive rights in the body of internationally recognized human rights. At the Cairo Conference, several states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] either to the concept of reproductive rights or to its specific content.  [[Ecuador]], for instance, stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the Programme of Action of the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws of Ecuador and the norms of international law, the delegation of Ecuador reaffirms, inter alia, the following principles embodied in its Constitution:  the inviolability of life, the protection of children from the moment of conception, freedom of conscience and religion, the protection of the family as the fundamental unit of society, responsible paternity, the right of parents to bring up their children and the formulation of population and development plans by the Government in accordance with the principles of respect for sovereignty. Accordingly, the delegation of Ecuador enters a reservation with respect to all terms such as "regulation of fertility", "interruption of pregnancy", "reproductive health", "reproductive rights" and "unwanted children", which in one way or another, within the context of the Programme of Action, could involve abortion.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similar reservations were made by [[Argentina]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Malta]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and the [[Holy See]]. Islamic Countries, such as [[Brunei]], [[Djibouti]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]] made broad reservations against any element of the programme that could be interpreted as contrary to the [[Sharia]]. Guatemala even questioned whether the conference could legally proclaim new human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html United Nations, Report of the Fourth International Conference on Population and Development, Cario, 5 - 13 September 1994]. Guatemala entered the following reservation:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chapter VII:  we enter a reservation on the whole chapter, for the General Assembly's mandate to the Conference does not extend to the creation or formulation of rights; this reservation therefore applies to all references in the document to "reproductive rights", "sexual rights", "reproductive health", "fertility regulation", "sexual health", "individuals", "sexual education and services for minors", "abortion in all its forms", "distribution of contraceptives" and "safe motherhood"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{see also|Women’s rights|Reproductive justice}}
{{Feminism sidebar}}
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) advocate for reproductive rights with a primary emphasis on [[women's rights]]. In this respect the UN and WHO focus on a range of issues from access to [[family planning]] services, sex education, [[menopause]], and the reduction of [[obstetric fistula]], to the relationship between reproductive health and economic status.

The reproductive rights of women are advanced in the context of the right to freedom from [[discrimination]] and the social and economic status of women. The group Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) explained the link in the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Control over reproduction is a basic need and a basic right for all women. Linked as it is to women's health and social status, as well as the powerful social structures of religion, state control and administrative inertia, and private profit, it is from the perspective of poor women that this right can best be understood and affirmed. Women know that childbearing is a social, not a purely personal, phenomenon; nor do we deny that world population trends are likely to exert considerable pressure on resources and institutions by the end of this century. But our bodies have become a pawn in the struggles among states, religions, male heads of households, and private corporations. Programs that do not take the interests of women into account are unlikely to succeed...&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women's reproductive rights have long retained key issue status in the debate on [[overpopulation]].&lt;ref name=popsearch/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only ray of hope I can see – and it's not much – is that wherever women are put in control of their lives, both politically and socially; where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions, birth rate falls. Women don't want to have 12 kids of whom nine will die." ''[[David Attenborough|David&amp;nbsp;Attenborough]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir David Attenborough on the roots of Climatic problems|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/sir-david-attenborough-this-awful-summer-weve-only-ourselves-to-blame-7942405.html|website=Independent.co.uk|publisher=The Independent, UK broadsheet newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[OHCHR]]: "Women’s sexual and reproductive health is related to multiple human rights, including the right to life, the right to be free from torture, the right to health, the right to privacy, the right to education, and the prohibition of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/women/wrgs/pages/healthrights.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts have been made to analyse the socioeconomic conditions that affect the realisation of a woman's reproductive rights. The term [[reproductive justice]] has been used to describe these broader social and economic issues. Proponents of reproductive justice argue that while the right to [[abortion law|legalized abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/gov/bl_roe_e.htm|title=Women's History|website=Womenshistory.about.com|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contraception applies to everyone, these choices are only meaningful to those with resources, and that there is a growing gap between access and affordability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Okazawa-Rey 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men's rights==
{{see also|Men's rights}}
{{Masculism sidebar}}
Men's reproductive rights have been claimed by various organizations, both for issues of reproductive health, and other rights related to sexual reproduction.

Three international issues in men's reproductive health are [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, cancer and exposure to [[toxins]].&lt;ref name = "NETWORK"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/Network/v18_3/NW183ch2.htm |title=Men's Reproductive Health Risks: Threats to men's fertility and reproductive health include disease, cancer and exposure to toxins |accessdate=2008-01-02 |last1=Best |first1=Kim |date=Spring 1998 |journal=Network |pages=7–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently men's reproductive right with regards to paternity have become subject of debate in the U.S.  The term "[[male abortion]]" was coined by Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in a 1998 article.  The theory begins with the premise that when a woman becomes pregnant she has the option of abortion, adoption, or parenthood; it argues, in the context of legally recognized [[gender equality]], that in the earliest stages of pregnancy the putative (alleged) father should have the right to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility, leaving the informed mother with the same three options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCulley Melanie G | year = 1998 | title = The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child | url = | journal = The Journal of Law and Policy | volume = VII | issue =1 | pages =1–55 |pmid=12666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization [[National Organization for Women]], attorney [[Karen DeCrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2000/10/19/mens_choice|title=A man's right to choose|last1=Young|first1=Kathy|date=Oct 19, 2000|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate= May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist]] argument for male reproductive choice contends that the uneven ability to choose experienced by men and women in regards to parenthood is evidence of a state-enforced [[coercion]] favoring traditional [[sex roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa Lucile |last1=Owens |year=2013 |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |pages=1–33 |ssrn=2439294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Center for Men brought a case in the US, ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]'' (dubbed by some "''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' for men"), that argued that in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, when an unmarried woman informs a man that she is pregnant by him, he should have an opportunity to give up all paternity rights and responsibilities.  Supporters argue that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;Traister, Rebecca. (March 13, 2006).

The opportunity to give men the right for a [[Paper Abortion]] is heavily discussed.

==Intersex and reproductive rights==

UN agencies have begun to take note. On 1 February 2013, Juan E Mendés, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, issued a statement condemning non-consensual surgical intervention on intersex people. His report stated, "Children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, "in an attempt to fix their sex", leaving them with permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering".&lt;ref name="untorture"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture], [[Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement'' with the [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]].

===Minors===
{{See|Parental consent}}
In many jurisdictions minors require parental consent or parental notification in order to access various reproductive services, such as contraception, abortion, gynecological consultations,  testing for STDs etc. The requirement that minors have parental consent/notification for testing for [[HIV/AIDS]] is especially controversial, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic, and it is a sensitive subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/adolescent/hiv-testing-treatment/page/Informed_consent_and_HIV_testing|title=World Health Organization - HIV and Adolescents from Guidance to Action|first=World Health|last=Organization|website=apps.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/696753/doh-backs-bill-allowing-minor-to-get-hiv-aids-tests-without-parental-consent|title=DOH backs bill allowing minor to get HIV, AIDS tests without parental consent|first=Jocelyn R.|last=Uy|website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2014/july/20140723_youth|title=Challenging parental consent laws to increase young people's access to vital HIV services - UNAIDS|website=Unaids.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balancing minors' rights versus parental rights is considered an [[ethical]] problem in medicine and law, and there have been many court cases on this issue in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/456472_6|title=Medscape Log In|website=Medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important concept recognized since 1989 by the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] is that of the [[evolving capacities|

[[Youth]] are often denied equal access to reproductive health services because [[health workers]] view adolescent sexual activity as unacceptable,&lt;ref name=Mugisha&gt;{{cite book |last=Mugisha|first=Frederick |editor-first=Andy|editor-last=Furlong|title=Handbook of Youth and Young Adulthood |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |pages=344–352 |chapter=Chapter 42: HIV and AIDS, STIs and sexual health among young people |isbn=978-0-415-44541-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or see sex education as the responsibility of parents.  Providers of reproductive health have little accountability to youth clients, a primary factor in denying youth access to reproductive health care.&lt;ref name=Mugisha /&gt; In many countries, regardless of legislation, minors are denied even the most basic reproductive care, if they are not accompanied by parents: in India, for instance, in 2017, a 17-year-old girl who was rejected by her family due to her pregnancy, was also rejected by hospitals and gave birth in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/india-chandil-homeless-street-jharkand-medical-centre-a7918611.html|title=Homeless girl in India forced to give birth on street metres away from health centre: She was shivering and unable to lift and cuddle her infant|date=August 29, 2017|first=Andrew|last=Lowry|work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the lack of reproductive rights for adolescents has been a concern of international organizations, such as [[UNFPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health|title=Adolescent sexual and reproductive health - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandatory involvement of parents in cases where the minor has sufficient maturity to understand their situation is considered by health organization as a violation of minor's rights and detrimental to their health. The [[World Health Organization]] has criticized parental consent/notification laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women. Examples include specific individuals or groups being subjected to physical and verbal abuse or violence; involuntary treatment; '''breaches of confidentiality and/or denial of autonomous decision-making, such as the requirement of consent to treatment by parents, spouses or guardians'''; and lack of free and informed consent. [...] Laws and policies must respect the principles of autonomy in health care decision-making; guarantee free and informed consent, privacy and confidentiality; prohibit mandatory HIV testing; prohibit screening procedures that are not of benefit to the individual or the public; and ban involuntary treatment and '''mandatory third-party authorization and notification requirements'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings — Joint WHO/UN statement|work=World Health Organization|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to UNICEF: "When dealing with sexual and reproductive health, the obligation
to inform parents and obtain their consent becomes a significant barrier with consequences for adolescents’ lives and for public health in general."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/lac/1._DIG._Min_age_of_medical_consent_PDF_BAJA_.pdf|title=Legal minimum ages and the realization of adolescents' rights|website=Unicef|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One specific issue which is seen as a form of hypocrisy of legislators is that of having a higher age of medical consent for the purpose of reproductive and sexual health than the [[age of sexual consent]] - in such cases the law allows youth to engage in sexual activity, but does not allow them to consent to medical procedures that may arise from being sexually active; UNICEF states that "On sexual and reproductive health matters, the minimum age of medical consent should never be higher than the age of sexual consent."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA" /&gt;

[[Abstinence-only sex education]] is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage, most often excluding other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.]]

Many [[unintended pregnancies]] stem from traditional contraceptive methods or no [[contraceptive]] measures.&lt;ref name=Lukale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukale|first=Nelly|title=Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights for Young People in Africa|journal=ARROWs for Change|year=2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth sexual education in Uganda is relatively low.  [[Comprehensive sex education]] is not generally taught in schools; even if it was, the majority of young people do not stay in school after the age of fifteen, so information would be limited regardless.&lt;ref name=Knudson&gt;{{cite book|last=Knudson|first=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|year=2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|location=Nashville, TN}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] experiences high rates of unintended pregnancy, along with high rates of [[HIV/AIDS]].  Young women aged 15–24 are eight times more likely to have HIV/AIDS than young men. [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is the world region most affected by HIV/AIDS, with approximately 25 million people living with HIV in 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for two-thirds of the global total of new HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids|title=HIV/AIDS Factsheet|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempted [[abortions]] and [[unsafe abortions]] are a risk for youth in Africa.  On average, there are 2.4 million unsafe abortions in East Africa, 1.8 million in Western Africa, over 900,000 in Middle Africa, and over 100,000 in Southern Africa each year.&lt;ref name=Lukale /&gt;

In [[Uganda]], abortion is illegal except to save the mother's life.  However, 78% of teenagers report knowing someone who has had an abortion and the police do not always prosecute everyone who has an abortion.  An estimated 22% of all [[maternal deaths]] in the area stem from illegal, unsafe abortions.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

===European Union===
Over 85% of European women (all ages) have used some form of [[birth control]] in their lives.&lt;ref name=Irala /&gt;  Europeans as an aggregate report using [[Oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] and [[condoms]] as the most commonly used contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Irala&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.004 |pmid=22078183 |title=Choice of birth control methods among European women and the role of partners and providers |journal=Contraception |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=558–64 |year=2011 |last1=De Irala |first1=Jokin |last2=Osorio |first2=Alfonso |last3=Carlos |first3=Silvia |last4=Lopez-Del Burgo |first4=Cristina |hdl=10171/19110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Family planning]] has become prominent throughout the region and most taboos concerning sexuality have been lifted or diminished.&lt;ref name=Ketting&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20836943 |year=2010 |author1=Ketting |first1=E |title=Integrating sexual and reproductive health in primary health care in Europe: Position paper of the European Forum for Primary Care |journal=Quality in Primary Care |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=269–82 |last2=Esin |first2=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Youth sexual and reproductive health centers have been established across most of the region.&lt;ref name=Ketting /&gt;  In [[Sweden]], approximately 80% of girls and 17% of boys have visited these youth centers, which provide all or nearly all services youth need at little to no charge.&lt;ref name=Ketting /&gt;  Sweden has the highest percentage of lifetime contraceptive use, with 96% of its inhabitants claiming to have used birth control at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Irala /&gt; Sweden also has a high self-reported rate of [[Emergency contraception|postcoital pill use]].&lt;ref name=Irala /&gt;  A 2007 anonymous survey of Swedish 18-year-olds showed that three out of four youth were sexually active, with 5% reporting having had an [[abortion]] and 4% reporting the contraction of an [[Sexually transmitted disease|STI]].&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13625180701217026 |pmid=17559009 |title=Contraceptive use and associated factors among Swedish high school students |journal=The European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=119–24 |year=2009 |last1=Larsson |first1=Margareta |last2=Tydén |first2=Tanja |last3=Hanson |first3=Ulf |last4=Häggström-Nordin |first4=Elisabet }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar centers exist in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=Ketting/&gt;

Views on sexual practice vary throughout the region.  For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), sex among youth is generally looked down upon and seen as a problem in need of solution.  In the [[Netherlands]], sex between youth is viewed as normal and therefore not discussed in terms of solutions, but rather in terms of ensuring safe practices.  That being said, the UK tends to focus on stopping sexual behavior, while the Netherlands focuses on building self-esteem and healthy relationships.&lt;ref name=Ketting /&gt;

===Latin America===
{{Main|Reproductive rights in Latin America}}
[[Latin America]] has come to international attention due to its harsh anti-abortion laws. Latin America is home to some of the few countries of the world with a complete ban on abortion, without an exception for saving [[maternal mortality|maternal life]].&lt;ref name="ChileCourt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41005517|title=Chile abortion: Court approves easing total ban|date=August 21, 2017|work=BBC|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some of these countries, particularity in [[Central America]], the enforcement of such laws is very aggressive: [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]] and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] have drawn international attention for strong enforcement of their complete bans on abortion. In 2017, [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]] relaxed its total ban, allowing abortion to be performed when the woman’s life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/chile-the-long-road-to-abortion-reform-a7917791.html|title=Chile: the long road to abortion reform — After a fierce debate, one of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the world has been eased|date=August 29, 2017|first=Cordelia|last=Freeman |work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ecuador]], education and class play a large role in the definition of which young women become pregnant and which do not - 50% of young women who are illiterate get pregnant, compared to 11% of girls with secondary education.  The same is true for poorer individuals - 28% become impregnated while only 11% of young women in wealthier households do.  Furthermore, access to reproductive rights, including contraceptives, are limited, due to age and the perception of female morality.  Health care providers often discuss contraception theoretically, not as a device to be used on a regular basis.  Decisions concerning sexual activity often involve secrecy and taboos, as well as a lack of access to accurate information.  Even more telling, young women have much easier access to maternal healthcare than they do to contraceptive help, which helps explain high pregnancy rates in the region.&lt;ref name=Goicolea&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goicolea|first=Isabel|title=Adolescent Pregnancies in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador: A Rights and Gender Approach to Adolescents' Sexual and Reproductive Health|journal=Global Health Action|year=2010|volume=3|pages=1–11|doi=10.3402/gha.v3i0.5280|pmid=20596248|pmc=2893010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of [[adolescent pregnancy]] in Latin America number over a million each year.&lt;ref name=Goicolea /&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Birth control in the United States}}
Among sexually experienced teenagers, 78% of teenage females and 85% of teenage males used contraception the first time they had sex; 86% and 93% of these same females and males, respectively, reported using contraception the last time they had sex.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet Guttmacher"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Contraceptive Use in the United States|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=2004-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The male [[condom]] is the most commonly used method during first sex, although 54% of young women in the United States rely upon the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|pill]].&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet Guttmacher" /&gt;

Young people in the U.S. are no more sexually active than individuals in other developed countries, but they are significantly less knowledgeable about contraception and safe sex practices.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt; As of 2006, only twenty states required [[sex education]] in schools - of these, only ten required information about contraception.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  On the whole, less than 10% of American students receive sex education that includes topical coverage of [[abortion]], [[homosexuality]], [[Intimate relationships|relationships]], [[pregnancy]], and STI prevention.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  [[Abstinence-only education]] was used throughout much of the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  Based upon the moral principle that sex outside of marriage is unacceptable, the programs often misled students about their rights to have sex, the consequences, and prevention of pregnancy and STIs.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

[[Abortion in the United States]] is legal since the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' which decriminalised abortion nationwide in 1973, and established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). That basic framework, modified in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), remains nominally in place, although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many counties have no abortion providers.&lt;ref name="Doan3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57|author1=Alesha Doan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' held that a law cannot place legal restrictions imposing an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for "the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."&lt;ref&gt;Casey, 505 U.S. at 877.&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is a controversial political issue, and regular attempts to restrict it occur in most states. One such case, originating in [[Texas]], led to the Supreme Court case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'' (2016) in which several Texas restrictions were struck down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36641063|title=Strict Texas abortion law struck down|date=27 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of knowledge about rights==
One of the reasons why reproductive rights are poor in many places, is that the vast majority of the population does not know what the law is. Not only are ordinary people uninformed, but so are medical doctors. A study in Brazil on medical doctors found considerable ignorance and misunderstanding of the law on abortion (which is severely restricted, but not completely illegal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brazilian obstetrician-gynecologists and abortion: a survey of knowledge, opinions and practices|first1=Lisa A.|last1=Goldman|first2=Sandra G.|last2=García|first3=Juan|last3=Díaz|first4=Eileen A.|last4=Yam|date=15 November 2005|journal=Reproductive Health|volume=2|pages=10|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-2-10|pmid=16288647|pmc=1308861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghana, abortion, while restricted, is permitted on several grounds, but only 3% of pregnant women and 6% of those seeking an abortion were aware of the legal status of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/abortion-ghana|title=Abortion in Ghana|date=24 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, abortion was legalized in 2002, but a study in 2009 found that only half of women knew that abortion was legalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/09/nepal-only-half-of-women-know-abortion-is-legal/|title=NEPAL: Only Half of Women Know Abortion is Legal - Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also do not understand the laws on [[sexual violence]]: in Hungary, where [[marital rape]] was made illegal in 1997, in a study in 2006, 62% of people did not know that marital rape was a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur27/002/2007/en/|title=Wayback Machine|date=8 June 2011|publisher=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/undp-cpr-8-point-agenda-practical-positive-outcomes-girls-women-crisis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|first=United Nations General|last=Assembly|website=www.un-documents.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equality and violence against women==
{{Further|Gender equality|Violence against women|Sexual violence|Forced marriage|Child marriage}}
Addressing issues of gender-based violence is crucial for attaining reproductive rights. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] refers to "'''''Equality and equity for men and women''', to enable individuals to make free and informed choices in all spheres of life, free from discrimination based on gender''" and "''Sexual and reproductive security, '''including freedom from sexual violence and coercion''', and the right to privacy,''" as part of achieving reproductive rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/rights/rights.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; Supporting the Constellation of Reproductive Rights |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that the '''right to liberty and security of the person''' which is fundamental to reproductive rights obliges states to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/english/ch3/ch3_box9.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; State of World Population 2005 |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Take measures to prevent, punish and eradicate all forms of gender-based violence
* Eliminate female genital mutilation/cutting

The WHO states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hhr/activities/GRR/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and Reproductive Rights |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Gender and Reproductive Rights (GRR) aims to promote and protect human rights and gender equality as they relate to sexual and reproductive health by developing strategies and mechanisms for promoting gender equity and equality and human rights in the Departments global and national activities, as well as within the functioning and priority-setting of the Department itself."

Amnesty International writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/stop-violence-against-women/issues/implementation-existing-laws/srr |title=Sexual and reproductive rights &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Violence against women violates women's rights to life, physical and mental integrity, to the highest attainable standard of health, to freedom from torture and it violates their sexual and reproductive rights."

One key issue for achieving reproductive rights is criminalization of [[sexual violence]]. If a woman is not protected from forced sexual intercourse, she is not protected from [[forced pregnancy]], namely [[pregnancy from rape]]. In order for a woman to be able to have reproductive rights, she must have the right to choose with whom and when to reproduce; and first of all, decide whether, when, and under what circumstances to be sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/gender_rights/sexual_health/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and human rights |publisher=Who.int |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, these rights of women are not respected, because women do not have a choice in regard to their partner, with [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]] being common in parts of the world; and neither do they have any rights in regard to sexual activity, as many countries do not allow women to refuse to engage in sexual intercourse when they do not want to (because [[marital rape]] is not criminalized in those countries) or to engage in consensual sexual intercourse if they want to (because sex outside marriage is illegal in those countries). In addition to legal barriers, there are also social barriers, because in many countries a complete sexual subordination of a woman to her husband is expected (for instance, in one survey 74% of women in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?rh04047 |title=Bioline International Official Site (site up-dated regularly) |publisher=Bioline.org.br |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while sexual/romantic relations disapproved by family members, or generally sex outside marriage, can result in serious violence, such as [[honor killings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/ |title=Ethics: Honour Crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the CDC, "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens a person’s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. No effective cure exists for HIV. But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html|title=HIV Basics {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|website=Cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-05|date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HIV amelioration is an important aspect of reproductive rights because the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or birth, or via breast milk.

The WHO states that: "All women, including those with HIV, have the right “to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights”".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/11/08-059360/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Reproductive choices for women with HIV |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive rights of people living with HIV, and their health, are very important. The link between HIV and reproductive rights exists in regard to four main issues:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* prevention of unwanted pregnancy
* help to plan wanted pregnancy
* healthcare during and after pregnancy
* access to abortion services

==Child and forced marriage==
{{Main|Child marriage|Forced marriage}}
The WHO states that the reproductive rights and health of girls in child marriages are negatively affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/news/news/2012/12/child-marriage-a-threat-to-health|title=Child marriage – a threat to health|date=20 December 2012|website=www.euro.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations Population Fund|UNPF]] calls child marriage a "human rights violation" and states that in developing countries, one in every three girls is married before reaching age 18, and one in nine is married under age 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/child-marriage|title=Child marriage - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is married without his or her consent or against his or her will.

==Sexual violence in armed conflict==
{{Main|Wartime sexual violence|Pregnancy from rape}}
Sexual violence in armed conflict is [[sexual violence]] committed by [[combatant]]s during [[armed conflict]], war, or [[military occupation]] often as [[War looting|spoils of war]]; but sometimes, particularly in [[ethnic conflict]], the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. It often includes [[gang rape]]. Rape is often used as a tactic of war and a threat to international security.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/rapeweaponwar.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence in armed conflict is a violation of reproductive rights, and often leads to [[forced pregnancy]]  and [[sexually transmitted infections]]. Such sexual violations affect mostly women and girls,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00981389.2016.1240134?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=wshc20&lt;/ref&gt; but [[rape of men]] can also occur, such as in [[ Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name=Melhado&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melhado|first=L|title=Rates of Sexual Violence Are High in Democratic Republic of the Congo|journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=36|number=4|year=2010|p=210|jstor=41038670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Autesserre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Autesserre|first=Séverine|title=Dangerous Tales: Dominant Narratives on the Congo and their Unintended Consequences|journal=African Affairs|volume=111|issue=443|year=2012|pages=202–222|doi=10.1093/afraf/adr080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All birth control methods meet opposition, especially [[religion|religious]] opposition, in some parts of the world. Opposition does not only target modern methods, but also 'traditional' ones : for example, the [[Quiverfull]] movement, a conservative Christian ideology, encourages the maximization of procreation, and opposes all forms of birth control, including [[natural family planning]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/protestant-group-advocates-leaving-fertility-in-gods-hands-no-birth-control&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
{{Further|Abortion law}}
According to a study by WHO and the Guttmacher Institute worldwide, 25 million [[unsafe abortion]]s (45% of all abortions) occurred every year between 2010 and 2014. 97% of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. By contrast, most abortions that take place in Western and Northern Europe and North America are safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/unsafe-abortions-worldwide/en/|title=Worldwide, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions  that  allow,  tolerate  or  condone  forms  of  gender based  violence against women, including [...] legislation  that  criminalises  abortion".&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt;

An article from the World Health Organization calls safe, legal abortion a "[[fundamental right]] of women, irrespective of where they live" and [[unsafe abortion]] a "silent [[pandemic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion - The Preventable Pandemic|accessdate=2010-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113104553/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|archivedate=2010-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent [[public health|public-health]] and [[human-rights]] imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves [[women’s health]], and vice versa, as documented in [[Romania]] during the regime of President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: “As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets." &lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Preventing unsafe abortion |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/ |title=HRP &amp;#124; World Health Organization |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four inter-related activities:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;
* to collate, synthesize and generate scientifically sound evidence on unsafe abortion prevalence and practices;
* to develop improved technologies and implement interventions to make abortion safer;
* to translate evidence into norms, tools and guidelines;
* and to assist in the development of programmes and policies that reduce unsafe abortion and improve access to safe abortion and highquality postabortion care

The UN has estimated in 2017 that repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55141|title=UN News - Repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year – UN experts|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=27 September 2016|website=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsafe abortions take place primarily in countries where abortion is illegal, but also occur in countries where it is legal, but women cannot access it because of various reasons ([[conscientious objector]]s among doctors, high prices, lack of knowledge that abortion is legal). Indeed, there are countries where the law  is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being  conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|journal=The Guardian|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia :: Balkan Insight|website=www.balkaninsight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that is some countries where abortion is legal it is ''[[de facto]]'' very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safe and legal abortion services are often very difficult to access by women from rural areas or from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In 2008, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that "In fact, even where abortion is permitted by law, women often have severely limited access to safe abortion services because of lack of proper regulation, health services, or political will" and estimated that "Approximately 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/women/abortion.html|title=Human Rights Watch: Women's Human Rights: Abortion|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maputo Protocol]], which was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], states at  Article 14 (Health and Reproductive Rights) that: "(2). States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to: [...] c) protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/#14&lt;/ref&gt; The Maputo Protocol is the first international treaty to recognize abortion, under certain conditions, as a woman's human right.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/general-comment-two-rights-women/&lt;/ref&gt;

The  ''General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], on the right to life'', adopted by the [[Human Rights Committee]] in 2018, defines, for the first time ever, a human right to abortion - in certain circumstances (however these UN general comments are considered [[soft law]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/un-human-rights-treaty-bodies/general-comments-of-the-human-rights-committee-and-their-legitimacy/EF8328BB5B2B3EC932E44C45E192EB9B&lt;/ref&gt; and, as such, not legally binding).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although   States   parties   may  adopt measures designed to regulate voluntary terminations of pregnancy, such measures must not result in violation of the right to life of a pregnant woman or girl, or her other rights under the Covenant. Thus, restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives, subject them  to  physical  or  mental  pain  or  suffering  which violates  article  7,  discriminate  against them  or  arbitrarily  interfere  with  their  privacy.  ''States  parties  must  provide  safe,  legal  and effective  access  to  abortion where  the  life  and  health  of  the  pregnant  woman  or girl  is  at risk,  and  where  carrying a pregnancy to term  would cause  the  pregnant  woman  or  girl substantial  pain  or  suffering,  most  notably  where  the  pregnancy  is  the  result  of  rape  or incest or is not viable.'' [8] In addition, States parties may not regulate pregnancy or abortion in all other cases in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do  not  have  to  undertake  unsafe  abortions,  and  they should  revise  their  abortion  laws accordingly.  [9]  For  example,  they  should  not  take measures  such  as  criminalizing pregnancies  by  unmarried  women  or  apply  criminal  sanctions  against  women  and  girls undergoing  abortion  [10]  or  against  medical  service providers  assisting  them  in  doing  so, since  taking  such  measures  compel  women  and  girls  to  resort  to  unsafe  abortion.  States parties should not introduce new barriers and should remove existing barriers [11] that deny effective  access  by  women  and  girls  to  safe  and  legal  abortion  [12],  including  barriers caused  as  a  result  of  the  exercise  of  conscientious objection  by  individual  medical providers. [13]"&lt;ref&gt;https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CCPR/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CCPR_C_GC_36_8785_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], a group comprising members from 47 European countries, adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2008/04/18/index.html |title=Council of Europe Urges Member States to Decriminalize Abortion |publisher=Guttmacher.org |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term ‘reproductive health’ in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference.
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council’s commitment to promote ‘reproductive health’ did not include the promotion of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term ‘reproductive health’ include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” - Antonione, Council: “No.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:

''“The term ‘reproductive health’ was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, '''which makes no reference to abortion'''.”''&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the U.S., it should be noted that, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the U.S. delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record:

''“Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.”''&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, the position of the U.S. Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: ''“nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing  in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion”''.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She added: ''“There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition”''.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] states that "access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to [international] development".&lt;ref name=IDS2009&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121649491/issue | title = Unsafe Abortion: A Development Issue | journal = Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Bulletin | volume = 39 | date = July 2009 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda.&lt;ref name=IDS2009 /&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] complicated the question even more through a landmark judgment (case of ''[[A. B. and C. v. Ireland]]''), in which it is stated that the denial of abortion for health and/or well-being reasons is an interference with an individuals right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], an interference which in some cases can be justified.

===Population control===

A desire to achieve certain population targets has resulted throughout history in severely abusive practices, in cases where governments ignored human rights and enacted aggressive demographic policies. In the 20th century, several authoritarian governments have sought either to increase or to decrease the births rates, often through forceful intervention. One of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies is that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people.  Ceaușescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to [[illegal abortion]]s,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail.

The irony of Ceaușescu's aggressive natalist policy was a generation that may not have been born would eventually lead the [[Romanian Revolution]] which would overthrow and have him [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Execution|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freakonomics|last=Levitt &amp; Dubner|first=Steven &amp; Stephen|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2005|isbn=9780141019017|location=80 Strand, London WC2R ORL England|page=107|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark opposition with Ceaușescu's natalist policy was China's [[one child policy]], in effect from 1978 to 2015, which included abuses such as [[forced abortion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-18435126 |title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage - BBC News |journal=BBC News |date= 2012-06-14|accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has also been deemed responsible for the common practice of [[sex selective abortion]] which led to an imbalanced [[sex ratio]] in the country.&lt;ref name="Bulte, Heerink, &amp; Zhang, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulte, E., Heerink, N., &amp; Zhang, X.|title=China's one-child policy and 'the mystery of missing women': ethnic minorities and male-biased sex ratios.|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|year=2011|volume=73|issue=1|pages=0305–9049|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00601.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=4–5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, abortion opponents have begun to foment [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about reproductive rights advocates, accusing them of advancing a [[Racism|racist]] agenda of [[eugenics]], and of trying to reduce the [[African American]] birth rate in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Dewan&gt;{{Cite news | last = Dewan | first = Shaila | author-link = | title = To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = February 26, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html | accessdate = 7 June 2010 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bride kidnapping]] or marriage by abduction, is the practice whereby a woman or girl is abducted for the purpose of a [[forced marriage]]. Bride kidnapping has been practiced historically in many parts of the world, and it continues to occur today in some places, especially in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]], in countries such as  Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Armenia, as well as in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyrgyzstan-women-bride-kidnapping/one-in-five-girls-and-women-kidnapped-for-marriage-in-kyrgyzstan-study-idUSKBN1AH5GI | title=One in five girls and women kidnapped for marriage in Kyrgyzstan| journal=Reuters| date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-10913297 | title=Chechen stolen brides 'exorcised'| journal=BBC News| date=2010-08-10| last1=Ash| first1=Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kidnapped-raped-married-the-extraordinary-rebellion-of-ethiopias-abducted-wives-1922263.html | title=Kidnapped.

Abducting of women may happen on an individual scale or on a mass scale. [[Raptio]] is a Latin term referring to the large-scale abduction of women, usually for marriage or sexual slavery, particularity during wartime.

* (ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his clan, has the right to transfer her to another person for value received or otherwise; or
* (iii) A woman on the death of her husband is liable to be inherited by another person;

===Sperm donation===
{{Further|Sperm donation|Sperm donor limitation by country}}
Laws in many countries and states require [[sperm donation|sperm donors]] to be either anonymous or known to the recipient, or the laws restrict the number of children each donor may father. Although many donors choose to remain anonymous, new [[technologies]] such as the Internet and DNA technology have opened up new avenues for those wishing to know more about the biological father, siblings and half-siblings.

====Ethnic minority women====

Ethnic minority women have often been victims of forced sterilization programs, such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian women]] in parts of Latin America of [[Roma people|Roma women]].

In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | accessdate=April 30, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archivedate=June 30, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on July 28, 1995. 

During the 20th century, forced sterilization of [[Romani people|Roma]] women in European countries, especially in former Communist countries, was practiced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8375960.stm |title=Czech regret over sterilisation |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popdev.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/u4763/DT+71+Albert.pdf|title=PopDev|website=popdev.hampshire.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are allegations that these practices continue unofficially in some countries, such as Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denysenko |first=Marina |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6409699.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Sterilised Roma accuse Czechs |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/czech/kocab-draws-attention-to-the-forced-sterilization-of-romani-women-most-recent-incident-allegedly-took-place-in-2007 |title=Kocáb draws attention to the forced sterilization of Romani women; most recent incident allegedly took place in 2007 |publisher=Romea.cz |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[V.

====United States====
{{Further|Eugenics in the United States|Sterilization law in the United States}}
Forced sterilization in the United States was practiced starting with the 19th century. The United States during the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas C. Leonard]], professor at Princeton University, describes American eugenics and sterilization as ultimately rooted in economic arguments and further as a central element of Progressivism alongside wage controls, restricted immigration, and the introduction of [[pension]] programs.&lt;ref name="Leonard2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leonard | first1 = Thomas C. | year = 2005 | title = Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era | url = https://www.princeton.edu/%7Etleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 207–224 | doi = 10.1257/089533005775196642 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161218214328/http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf | archivedate = 2016-12-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The heads of the programs were avid proponents of eugenics and frequently argued for their programs which achieved some success nationwide mainly in the first half of the 20th Century.

====Canada====
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}
Compulsory sterilization has been practiced historically in parts of Canada. Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system.  However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

Some of the countries of [[Central America]], notably [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]], have also come to international attention due to very forceful enforcement of the anti-abortion laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/el-salvador-rape-survivor-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail-under-extreme-anti-abortion-law/|title=El Salvador: Rape survivor sentenced to 30 years in jail under extreme anti-abortion law|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-32491838/el-salvador-women-jailed-for-miscarriages|title=Jailed for a miscarriage|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Salvador has received repeated criticism from the UN. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) named the law "one of the most draconian abortion laws in the world", and urged liberalization,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid bin Ra'ad]], the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated that he was "appalled that as a result of El Salvador’s absolute prohibition on abortion, women are being punished for apparent miscarriages and other obstetric emergencies, accused and convicted of having induced termination of pregnancy".&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|opponents of legalized abortion]] view the term "reproductive rights" as a [[euphemism]] to sway emotions in favor of abortion.  [[National Right to Life]] has referred to "reproductive rights" as a "fudge term" and "the code word for ''abortion'' rights."&lt;ref name=NRLC&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CHOICE "THAT DARE NOT SPEAK ITS NAME"|url=http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|website=Nrlc.org|year=2003|accessdate=2017-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804230201/http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|archivedate=2013-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rete tubular ectasia''' is a [[benign]] condition, usually found in older men, involving numerous small, tubular [[cystic]] structures within the [[rete testis]].

==Mechanism==
The formation of cysts in the rete testis is associated with the obstruction of the [[efferent ducts]], which connect the rete testis with the head of the [[epididymis]]. They are often bilateral.&lt;ref name=nair&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nair|first1=R|last2=Abbaraju|first2=J|last3=Rajbabu|first3=K|last4=Anjum|first4=F|last5=Sriprasad|first5=S|title=Tubular ectasia of the rete testis: a diagnostic dilemma.|journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England|date=October 2008|volume=90|issue=7|pages=1–3|doi=10.1308/147870808X303119|pmid=18831860|pmc=2728311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The condition can be detected with sonography. It is commonly associated with epididymal abnormalities, such as [[spermatocele]], [[epididymal cyst]], and [[epididymitis]]. The condition  shares a common location with [[cystic dysplasia]] of the [[testis]] and [[intratesticular cysts]]. Unlike cystic neoplasms, they don't present specific tumor markers.&lt;ref name=bhatt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhatt|first1=S|last2=Jafri|first2=SZ|last3=Wasserman|first3=N|last4=Dogra|first4=VS|title=Imaging of non-neoplastic intratesticular masses.|journal=Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology (Ankara, Turkey)|date=March 2011|volume=17|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.4261/1305-3825.DIR.3116-09.0|pmid=20677130|url=http://www.dirjournal.org/eng/makale/490/34/Full-Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Typically none is required, but they can be treated surgically if symptomatic.&lt;ref name=bhatt /&gt;

== Commonly accepted determinants ==

[[File:Social Determinants of Health Infoviz.jpg|thumb|Social Determinants of Health Map]]

There is no single definition of the social determinants of health, but there are commonalities, and many governmental and non-governmental organizations recognize that there are social factors which impact the health of individuals.

In 2003, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Europe suggested that the social determinants of health included:&lt;ref name="WHO Europe"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/98438/e81384.pdf |title=The Social Determinants of Health: The Solid Facts |edition=2nd |format=PDF |year=2003 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] Europe |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-last=Wilkinson |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Marmot |isbn=978-92-890-1371-0}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Social exclusion]]
* Work
* [[Unemployment]]
* [[Social support]]
* [[Addiction]]
* [[Food]]
* [[Transportation]]

In Canada, these social determinants of health have gained wide usage.&lt;ref name=pmid20888059/&gt;
#[[Income]] and [[income distribution]]
#[[Education]]
#[[Unemployment]] and [[job security]]
#[[Employment]] and [[working conditions]]

#[[Social exclusion]]/inclusion
#[[Social safety net]]work
#[[Health care|Health services]]
#[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] status
#[[Gender]]
#[[Race (human classification)|Race]]
#[[Disability]]

These social determinants of health are related to health outcomes, public policy, and are easily understood by the public to impact health. They tend to cluster together – for example, those living in poverty experience a number of negative health determinants.&lt;ref name=pmid20888059&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.08.022 |pmid=20888059 |title=Canada: A land of missed opportunity for addressing the social determinants of health |journal=Health Policy |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=44–58 |year=2011 |last1=Bryant |first1=Toba |last2=Raphael |first2=Dennis |last3=Schrecker |first3=Ted |last4=Labonte |first4=Ronald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health published a report entitled "Closing the Gap in a Generation." This report identified two broad areas of social determinants of health that needed to be addressed.&lt;ref name="WHO CSDH"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf|title=Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity Through Action on the Social Determinants of Health|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|year=2008|isbn=978-92-4-156370-3|format=PDF|author=Commission on Social Determinants of Health|accessdate=2013-03-27}} Pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; The first area was daily [[living conditions]], which included healthy [[physical environment]]s, fair employment and decent work, [[social protection]] across the lifespan, and access to health care. The second major area was distribution of power, money, and resources, including [[health equity|equity]] in health programs, public financing of action on the social determinants, [[economic inequality|economic inequalities]], [[resource depletion]], [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2015-178/ healthy working conditions], [[gender equality|gender equity]], [[political empowerment]], constitution of reserves&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018-07-30|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a balance of power and prosperity of nations.&lt;ref name="WHO CSDH"/&gt;

The 2011 World Conference on Social Determinants of Health brought together delegations from 125 member states and resulted in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health.  This declaration involved an affirmation that health inequities are unacceptable, and noted that these inequities arise from the societal conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, including early childhood development, education, economic status, employment and decent work, housing environment, and effective prevention and treatment of health problems.&lt;ref name="Rio Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/sdhconference/declaration/Rio_political_declaration.pdf |title=Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health |format=PDF |year=2011 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |author=World Conference on Social Determinants of Health |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Centers for Disease Control defines social determinants of health as "life-enhancing resources, such as food supply, housing, economic and social relationships, transportation, education, and health care, whose distribution across populations effectively determines length and quality of life".&lt;ref name="USCDC"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Laura K. |last1=Brennan Ramirez |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Baker |first3=Marilyn |last3=Metzler |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dch/programs/healthycommunitiesprogram/tools/pdf/SDOH-workbook.pdf |title=Promoting Health Equity: A Resource to Help Communities Address Social Determinants of Health |format=PDF |year=2008 |publisher=[[United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=May 3, 2015 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include access to care and resources such as food, insurance coverage, income, housing, and transportation.&lt;ref name="USCDC"/&gt;  Social determinants of health influence [[health promotion|health-promoting]] behaviours, and [[health equity]] among the population is not possible without equitable distribution of social determinants among groups.&lt;ref name="USCDC"/&gt;

Steven H. Woolf, MD of the Virginia Commonwealth University Center on Human Needs states, "The degree to which social conditions affect health is illustrated by the association between education and mortality rates".&lt;ref name="Woolf, S. H 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.320 |pmid=19293418 |title=Social Policy as Health Policy |journal=JAMA |volume=301 |issue=11 |pages=1166–9 |year=2009 |last1=Woolf |first1=Steven H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports in 2005 revealed the [[mortality rate]] was 206.3 per 100,000 for adults aged 25 to 64 years with little education beyond high school, but was twice as great (477.6 per 100,000) for those with only a high school education and 3 times as great (650.4 per 100,000) for those less educated.  Based on the data collected, the social conditions such as education, income, and race were dependent on one another, but these social conditions also apply to independent health influences..&lt;ref name="Woolf, S. H 2009"/&gt;

Marmot and Bell of the University College London found that in wealthy countries, income and mortality are correlated as a marker of relative position within society, and this relative position is related to social conditions that are important for health including good [[early childhood development]], access to high quality education, rewarding work with some degree of autonomy, decent housing, and a clean and safe living environment. The social condition of [[autonomy]], control, and empowerment turns are important influences on health and disease, and individuals who lack social participation and control over their lives are at a greater risk for heart disease and mental illness.&lt;ref name="MarmotMichael"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.363 |pmid=19293419 |title=Action on Health Disparities in the United States |journal=JAMA |volume=301 |issue=11 |pages=1169–71 |year=2009 |last1=Marmot |first1=Michael G. |last2=Bell |first2=Ruth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International health inequalities ==

Even in the wealthiest countries, there are health inequalities between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref name="WHO Europe"/&gt; Researchers Labonte and Schrecker from the Department of Epidemiology and Community Medicine at the University of Ottawa emphasize that globalization is key to understanding the social determinants of health, and as Bushra (2011) posits, the impacts of globalization are unequal.&lt;ref name="Labonte"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-3-6 |pmid=17578569 |pmc=1919362 |title=Globalization and social determinants of health: The role of the global marketplace (part 2 of 3) |journal=Globalization and Health |volume=3 |pages=6 |year=2007 |last1=Labonté |first1=Ronald |last2=Schrecker |first2=Ted }}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization has caused an uneven distribution of wealth and power both within and across national borders, and where and in what situation a person is born has an enormous impact on their health outcomes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found significant differences among developed nations in [[ICU scoring systems|health status indicators]] such as life expectancy, [[infant mortality]], [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of disease, and death from injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. (2007). Health at a Glance 2007, OECD Indicators. Paris: Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Pg 25&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants and their family members also experience significant negatives health impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Michael|last2=Carreon|first2=Tania|last3=Eggerth|first3=Donald|last4=Johnson|first4=Antoinette|title=Immigration, Work, and Health: A Literature Review of Immigration Between Mexico and the United States|journal=Revista deTrabajo Social UNAM|date=2014|volume=7|issue=6|pages=129–149|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281782796_Immigration_work_and_heatlh_Inmigracion_trabajo_y_salud_English_Draft|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These inequalities may exist in the context of the [[health care system]], or in broader social approaches.  According to the WHO's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, access to health care is essential for equitable health, and it argued that health care should be a common good rather than a market [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="WHO CSDH"/&gt; However, there is substantial variation in health care systems and coverage from country to country.  The Commission also calls for government action on such things as access to clean water and safe, equitable working conditions, and it notes that dangerous working conditions exist even in some wealthy countries.&lt;ref name=" WHO CSDH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Michael|title=Undocumented Status as a Social Determinant of Occupational Safety and Health: The Workers’ Perspective.|journal=Am. J. Ind. Med|date=2015|volume=58|pages=1127–1137|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%27_perspective|accessdate=4 April 2017|doi=10.1002/ajim.22531}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, several key areas of action were identified to address inequalities, including promotion of participatory [[public policy|policy]]-making processes, strengthening [[global governance]] and [[collaboration]], and encouraging developed countries to reach a target of 0.7% of [[gross national product]] (GNP) for official [[development assistance]].&lt;ref name="Rio Declaration"/&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==

The UK ''Black'' and ''The Health Divide'' reports considered two primary mechanisms for understanding how social determinants influence health: cultural/behavioral and [[materialist]]/structuralist&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, P., Davidson, N., &amp; Whitehead, M. (Eds.). (1992). Inequalities in Health: the Black Report and the Health Divide. New York: Penguin.{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural/behavioral explanation is that individuals' behavioral choices (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use, diet, physical activity, etc.) were responsible for their development and deaths from a variety of diseases. However, both the ''Black'' and ''Health Divide'' reports found that behavioral choices are determined by one's material conditions of life, and these behavioral [[risk factors]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;account for a relatively small proportion of variation in the incidence and death from various diseases.

The materialist/structuralist explanation emphasizes the people's material living conditions. These conditions include availability of resources to access the [[amenities]] of life, [[working conditions]], and quality of available food and housing among others. Within this view, three frameworks have been developed to explain how social determinants influence health.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, M. (2003). Understanding Health Inequalities. Oxford UK: Polity Press.{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frameworks are: (a) materialist; (b) neo-materialist; and (c) [[psychosocial]] comparison. The materialist view explains how living conditions – and the social determinants of health that constitute these living conditions – shape health. The neo-materialist explanation extends the materialist analysis by asking how these living conditions occur. The psychosocial comparison explanation considers whether people compare themselves to others and how these comparisons affect health and wellbeing.

A nation's wealth is a strong indicator of the health of its population. Within nations, however, individual [[socio-economic]] position is a powerful predictor of health.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, H. (2007). Unequal Lives: Health and Socioeconomic Inequalities. New York: Open University Press.{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material conditions of life determine health by influencing the quality of individual development, family life and interaction, and community environments. Material conditions of life lead to differing likelihood of physical ([[infections]], [[malnutrition]], [[chronic disease]], and [[injuries]]), developmental (delayed or impaired [[Cognitive development|cognitive]], [[Personality development|personality]], and [[social development]]), educational ([[learning disabilities]], poor learning, early school leaving), and social ([[socialization]], preparation for work, and family life) problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shaw |first1=M. |last2=Dorling |first2=D. |last3=Gordon |first3=D. |last4=Smith |first4=G. D. |year=1999 |title=The Widening Gap: Health Inequalities and Policy in Britain |location=Bristol, UK |publisher=The Policy Press}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material conditions of life also lead to differences in psychosocial stress.&lt;ref name="MarmotWilkinson2005pp6-30"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198565895.003.02 |chapter=Social organization, stress, and health |title=Social Determinants of Health |pages=6–30 |year=2005 |last1=Marmot |first1=Michael |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Richard G. |isbn=978-0-19-856589-5 |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Marmot |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Wilkinson }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fight-or-flight reaction is chronically elicited in response to constant threats to income, housing, and food availability, the [[immune system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;is weakened, [[insulin resistance]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;is increased, and lipid and clotting disorders appear more frequently.

The materialist approach offers insight into the sources of health inequalities among individuals and nations. Adoption of health-threatening behaviours is also influenced by material deprivation and stress.&lt;ref name="MarmotWilkinson2005pp224-37"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198565895.003.11 |chapter=Social patterning of individual health behaviours: The case of cigarette smoking |title=Social Determinants of Health |pages=224–37 |year=2005 |last1=Marmot |first1=Michael |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Richard G. |isbn=978-0-19-856589-5 |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Marmot |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Wilkinson }}&lt;/ref&gt;Environments influence whether individuals take up tobacco, use alcohol, consume poor diets, and have low levels of physical activity. Tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and carbohydrate-dense diets are also used to cope with difficult circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=R. G. |year=1996 |title=Unhealthy Societies: The Afflictions of Inequality |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-09234-0}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarmotWilkinson2005pp224-37"/&gt; The materialist approach seeks to understand how these social determinants occur. 

The neo-materialist approach is concerned with how nations, regions, and cities differ on how economic and other resources are distributed among the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7243.1200 |pmid=10784551 |pmc=1127589 |title=Income inequality and mortality: Importance to health of individual income, psychosocial environment, or material conditions |journal=BMJ |volume=320 |issue=7243 |pages=1200–4 |year=2000 |last1=Lynch |first1=J. W |last2=Smith |first2=G. D. |last3=Kaplan |first3=G. A. |last4=House |first4=J. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distribution of resources can vary widely from country to country. The neo-materialist view focuses on both the social determinants of health and the societal factors that determine the distribution of these social determinants, and especially emphasizes how resources are distributed among members of a society. 

The social comparison approach holds that the social determinants of health play their role through citizens' interpretations of their standings in the [[social hierarchy]].&lt;ref name=KawachiKennedy2002&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kawachi |first1=I. |last2=Kennedy |first2=B. |year=2002 |title=The Health of Nations: Why Inequality Is Harmful to Your Health |location=New York |publisher=New Press}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two mechanisms by which this occurs. At the individual level, the perception and experience of one's status in unequal societies lead to stress and poor health. Feelings of shame, worthlessness, and envy can lead to harmful effects upon neuro-endocrine, autonomic and metabolic, and immune systems.&lt;ref name="MarmotWilkinson2005pp6-30"/&gt; Comparisons to those of a higher social class can also lead to attempts to alleviate such feelings by overspending, taking on additional employment that threaten health, and adopting health-threatening coping behaviours such as overeating and using alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref name=KawachiKennedy2002/&gt; At the communal level, widening and strengthening of hierarchy weakens [[social cohesion]], which is a determinant of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7086.1037 |pmid=9112854 |pmc=2126438 |title=Socioeconomic determinants of health : Health and social cohesion: Why care about income inequality? |journal=BMJ |volume=314 |issue=7086 |pages=1037–40 |year=1997 |last1=Kawachi |first1=I. |last2=Kennedy |first2=B. P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social comparison approach directs attention to the psychosocial effects of public policies that weaken the social determinants of health. However, these effects may be secondary to how societies distribute material resources and provide security to its citizens, which are described in the materialist and neo-materialist approaches.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Life-course perspective ==

Life-course approaches emphasize the accumulated effects of experience across the life span in understanding the maintenance of health and the onset of disease. The economic and social conditions – the social determinants of health – under which individuals live their lives have a cumulative effect upon the probability of developing any number of diseases, including heart disease and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blane |first=D. |year=2006 |chapter=The life course, the social gradient and health |editor1-first=M.

Hertzman outlines three [[health effect]]s that have relevance for a life-course perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hertzman |first=Clyde |title=The case for an early childhood development strategy |journal=Isuma |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=11–8 |year=2000 |url=http://www.peelearlyyears.com/pdf/The%20Case%20for%20an%20Early%20Childhood%20Development%20Strategy,%20Canada.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Latent effects are biological or developmental early life experiences that influence health later in life. [[Birth weight|Low birth weight]], for instance, is a reliable predictor of incidence of cardiovascular disease and adult-onset diabetes in later life. Nutritional deprivation during childhood has lasting health effects as well.

Pathway effects are experiences that set individuals onto trajectories that influence health, well-being, and competence over the life course. As one example, children who enter school with delayed vocabulary are set upon a path that leads to lower educational expectations, poor employment prospects, and greater likelihood of illness and disease across the lifespan. Deprivation associated with poor-quality neighbourhoods, schools, and housing sets children off on paths that are not conducive to health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Staying Alive: Critical Perspectives on Health, Illness, and Health Care|last=Raphael|first=Dennis|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|year=2010|isbn=9781551303703|location=Canada|pages=159|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Cumulative effects are the accumulation of advantage or disadvantage over time that manifests itself in poor health, in particular between women and men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landös|first=Aljoscha|last2=von Arx|first2=Martina|last3=Cheval|first3=Boris|last4=Sieber|first4=Stefan|last5=Kliegel|first5=Matthias|last6=Gabriel|first6=Rainer|last7=Orsholits|first7=Dan|last8=Linden|first8=Van Der|last9=A|first9=Bernadette W.|title=Childhood socioeconomic circumstances and disability trajectories in older men and women: a European cohort study|url=https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurpub/cky166/5078548|journal=European Journal of Public Health|language=en|doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky166}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These involve the combination of latent and pathways effects.

==Chronic stress and health==

[[Stress (psychological)|Stress]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;is hypothesized to be a major influence in the social determinants of health. There is a relationship between experience of chronic stress and negative health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Gouin&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1559827610395467 |title=Chronic Stress, Immune Dysregulation, and Health |journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=476–85 |year=2011 |last1=Gouin |first1=J.-P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is explained through both direct and indirect effects of chronic stress on health outcomes.

The direct relationship between stress and health outcomes is the effect of stress on human physiology. The long term stress hormone, [[cortisol]], is believed to be the key driver in this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.25 |pmid=17201569 |title=If it goes up, must it come down? Chronic stress and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in humans |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=25–45 |year=2007 |last1=Miller |first1=Gregory E. |last2=Chen |first2=Edith |last3=Zhou |first3=Eric S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic stress has been found to be significantly associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, slower wound healing, increased susceptibility to infections, and poorer responses to vaccines.&lt;ref name=Gouin /&gt; [[Meta-analysis]] of healing studies has found that there is a robust relationship between elevated stress levels and slower healing for many different acute and chronic conditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.04.002 |pmid=19686881 |title=Psychological stress and wound healing in humans: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=253–71 |year=2009 |last1=Walburn |first1=Jessica |last2=Vedhara |first2=Kavita |last3=Hankins |first3=Matthew |last4=Rixon |first4=Lorna |last5=Weinman |first5=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also important to note that certain factors, such as coping styles and social support, can mitigate the relationship between chronic stress and health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Cwikel&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cwikel |first1=Julie |last2=Segal-Engelchin |first2=Dorit |last3=Mendlinger |first3=Sheryl |title=Mothers' coping styles during times of chronic security stress: effect on health status | doi=10.1080/07399330903141245 |pmid=20390642 |journal= [[Health Care for Women International]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=131–52 |year=2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07399330903141245 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sheldon |last1=Cohen |first2=Garth |last2=McKay |chapter=Social Support, Stress and the Buffering Hypothesis: A Theoretical Analysis |editor1-first=A. |editor1-last=Baum |editor2-first=S.E. |editor2-last=Taylor |editor3-first=J.E. |editor3-last=Singer |year=1984 |title=Handbook of Psychology and Health |pages=253–67 |chapterurl=http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~scohen/buffer84.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress can also be seen to have an indirect effect on health status. One way this happens is due to the strain on the psychological resources of the stressed individual. Chronic stress is common in those of a low socio-economic status, who are having to balance worries about financial security, how they will feed their families, housing status, and many other concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/phe/phs022 |title=Behavior Change or Empowerment: On the Ethics of Health-Promotion Strategies |journal=Public Health Ethics |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=140–53 |year=2012 |last1=Tengland |first1=P.-A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, individuals with these kinds of worries may lack the emotional resources to adopt positive health behaviours. Chronically stressed individuals may therefore be less likely to prioritize their health.

In addition to this, the way that an individual responds to stress can influence their health status. Often, individuals responding to chronic stress will develop potentially positive or negative coping behaviors. People who cope with stress through positive behaviors such as exercise or social connections may not be as affected by the relationship between stress and health, whereas those with a coping style more prone to over-consumption (i.e. [[emotional eating]], drinking, smoking or drug use) are more likely to be see negative health effects of stress.&lt;ref name=Cwikel /&gt;

The detrimental effects of stress on health outcomes are hypothesised to partly explain why countries that have high levels of income inequality have poorer health outcomes compared to more equal countries.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;Wilkinson, R. &amp; Pickett, K. (2009) The spirit level : why more equal societies almost always do better. London: Allen Lane.{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson and Picket hypothesise in their book [[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better|The Spirit Level]] that the stressors associated with low social status are amplified in societies where others are clearly far better off.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; 

==Improving health conditions worldwide==
Reducing the health gap requires that governments build systems that allow a healthy standard of living for every resident. 

=== Interventions ===
Three common interventions for improving social determinant outcomes as identified by the WHO are education, social security and urban development. However, evaluation of interventions has been difficult due to the nature of the interventions, their impact and the fact that the interventions strongly affect children's health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;World Health Organization (2013). [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/84213/9789241548625_eng.pdf;jsessionid=97F39CFE3967A7FE93BA46E18B4418E9?sequence=1 The economics of social determinants of health and health inequalities: a resource book (PDF)].

#Education: Many scientific studies have been conducted and strongly suggests that increased quantity and quality of education leads to benefits to both the individual and society (e.g. improved labor productivity)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanushek|first=Eric|last2=Woessmann|first2=Ludger|date=November 2010|title=The Economics of International Differences in Education Achievement|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-the-economics-of-education/hanushek/978-0-444-53429-3|journal=Handbook of the Economics of Education|volume=3|pages=|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Health and economic outcome improvements can be seen in health measures such as [[blood pressure]]&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, David, and Adriana Lleras-Muney (2008). “Education and Health: Evaluating Theories and Evidence.” Making Americans Healthier: Social and Economic Policy as HealthPolicy, edited by J House, R Schoeni, G Kaplan, and H Pollack.

Examples of interventions include decreasing size of classes and providing additional resources to low-income school districts. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to support education as an social determinants intervention with a [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#Social Protection: Interventions such as “health-related cash transfers”, maternal education, and nutrition-based social protections have been shown to have a positive impact on health outcomes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chunh|first=Haejoo|last2=Muntaner|first2=Carles|date=2006|title=Welfare state matters: A typological multilevel analysis of wealthy countries|url=https://www.healthpolicyjrnl.com/article/S0168-8510(06)00056-X/fulltext|journal=Health Policy|volume=80.2|pages=328-339|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Economic Policy Research Institute (2004).

Commissioned by Directorate: Finance and Economics. Retrieved 2018-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the full economic costs and impacts generated of social security interventions are difficult to evaluate, especially as many social protections primarily affect children of recipients&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.
#Urban Development: Urban development interventions include a wide variety of potential targets such as housing, transportation, and infrastructure improvements. The health benefits are considerable (especially for children), because housing improvements such as smoke alarm installation, concrete flooring, removal of lead paint, etc. can have a direct impact on health&lt;ref&gt;Breysse et al. (2004). ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247625/ The Relationship between Housing and Health: Children at Risk.]'' Environ Health Perspect 112.15. pg 1583-1588.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, there is a fair amount of evidence to prove that external urban development interventions such as transportation improvements or improved walkability of neighborhoods (which is highly effective in developed countries) can have health benefits&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Affordable housing options (including public housing) can make large contributions to both social determinants of health, as well as the local economy&lt;ref&gt;Econsult Corp (2018).

The Commission on Social Determinants of Health made recommendations in 2005 for action to promote health equity based on three principles: "improve the circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age; tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources, the structural drivers of conditions of daily life, globally, nationally, and locally; and measure the problem, evaluate action, and expand the knowledge base."&lt;ref name="MarmotMichael2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marmot|first1=Michael G.|last2=Bell|first2=Ruth|year=2009|title=Action on Health Disparities in the United States|journal=JAMA|volume=301|issue=11|pages=1169–71|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.363|pmid=19293419}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations would involve providing resources such as quality education, decent housing, access to affordable health care, access to healthy food, and safe places to exercise for everyone despite gaps in affluence. Expansion of knowledge of the social determinants of health, including among healthcare workers, can improve the quality and standard of care for people who are marginalized, poor or living in developing nations by preventing early death and disability while working to improve quality of life.&lt;ref name="Farmer2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=Paul E.|last2=Nizeye|first2=Bruce|last3=Stulac|first3=Sara|last4=Keshavjee|first4=Salmaan|year=2006|title=Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e449|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449|pmc=1621099|pmid=17076568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges of measuring value of interventions ===
Many economic studies have been conducted to measure the effectiveness and value of social determinant interventions but are unable to accurately reflect effects on public health due to the multi-faceted nature of the topic. While neither [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] nor [[Cost–utility analysis|cost-utility analysis]] is able to be used on social determinant interventions, cost-benefit analysis is able to better capture the effects of an intervention on multiple sectors of the economy. For example, tobacco interventions have shown to decrease tobacco use, but also prolong lifespans, increasing lifetime healthcare costs and is therefore marked as a failed intervention by cost-effectiveness, but not cost-benefit. Another issue with research in this area is that most of the current scientific papers focus on rich, developed countries, and there is a lack of research in developing countries&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Policy changes that affect children also present the challenge that it takes a significant amount of time to gather this type of data. In addition, policies to reduce [[child poverty]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;are particularly important, as elevated stress hormones in children interfere with the development of brain circuitry and connections, causing long term chemical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=G. W.|last2=Schamberg|first2=M. A.|year=2009|title=Childhood poverty, chronic stress, and adult working memory|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=16|pages=6545–9|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.6545E|doi=10.1073/pnas.0811910106|jstor=40482133|pmc=2662958|pmid=19332779}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most wealthy countries, the relative child poverty rate is 10 percent or less; in the United States, it is 21.9 percent.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smeeding|first=Timothy|year=2006|title=Poor People in Rich Nations: The United States in Comparative Perspective|url=https://www2.hawaii.edu/~noy/300texts/poverty-comparative.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=20|pages=69–90|doi=10.1257/089533006776526094|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest poverty rates are more common in smaller well-developed and high-spending welfare states like Sweden and Finland, with about 5 or 6 percent.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  Middle-level rates are found in major European countries where unemployment compensation is more generous and social policies provide more generous support to single mothers and working women (through paid family leave, for example), and where social assistance minimums are high.  For instance, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and Germany have poverty rates that are in the 7 to 8 percent range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smeeding|first1=Timothy|year=2006|title=Poor People in Rich Nations: The United States in Comparative Perspective|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=20|issue=1|pages=69–90|doi=10.1257/089533006776526094|jstor=30033634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public policy ==

The Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health embraces a transparent, participatory model of policy development that, among other things, addresses the social determinants of health leading to persistent health inequalities for indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Rio Declaration"/&gt; In 2017, citing the need for accountability for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Detereminants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social detereminants of health that improve health equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784-787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The United States Department of Health and Human Services includes social determinants in its model of population health, and one of its missions is to strengthen policies which are backed by the best available evidence and knowledge in the field &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthypeople.gov/2020/Consortium/HP2020Framework.pdf |title=Healthy People 2020 Framework |format=PDF |year=2010 |publisher=United States Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=2013-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215084008/http://healthypeople.gov/2020/Consortium/HP2020Framework.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social determinants of health do not exist in a vacuum. Their quality and availability to the population are usually a result of public policy decisions made by governing authorities. For example, early life is shaped by availability of sufficient material resources that assure adequate educational opportunities, food and housing among others.  Much of this has to do with the employment security and the quality of working conditions and wages. The availability of quality, regulated childcare is an especially important policy option in support of early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gøsta |last1=Esping-Andersen |chapter=A Child-Centred Social Investment Strategy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=OaxGR8yrm10C&amp;pg=PA26 |pages=26–67 |editor1-first=Gøsta |editor1-last=Esping-Andersen |year=2002 |title=Why We Need a New Welfare State |isbn=978-0-19-925642-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not issues that usually come under individual control but rather they are socially constructed conditions which require institutional responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Michael|last2=Check|first2=Pietra|last3=Eggerth|first3=Donald|last4=Tonda|first4=Josana|title=Improving Occupational Safety and Health Among Mexican Immigrant Workers:|journal=Public Health Reports|date=2013|volume=128|issue=Suppl 3|pages=33–38|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258248322_Improving_Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Among_Mexican_Immigrant_Workers_A_Binational_Collaboration}}&lt;/ref&gt; A policy-oriented approach places such findings within a broader policy context. In this context, [[Health in All Policies]] has seen as a response to incorporate health and health equity into all public policies as means to foster synergy between sectors and ultimately promote health.

Yet it is not uncommon to see governmental and other authorities individualize these issues. Governments may view early life as being primarily about parental behaviours towards their children.  They then focus upon promoting better parenting, assist in having parents read to their children, or urge schools to foster exercise among children rather than raising the amount of financial or housing resources available to families. Indeed, for every social determinant of health, an individualized manifestation of each is available. There is little evidence to suggest the efficacy of such approaches in improving the health status of those most vulnerable to illness in the absence of efforts to modify their adverse living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raphael |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Inequality is Bad for our Hearts: Why Low Income and Social Exclusion are Major Causes of Heart Disease in Canada |isbn=0-9689444-0-X}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of the Cochrane Collaboration conducted the first comprehensive systematic review of the health impact of unconditional cash transfers, as an increasingly common up-stream, structural social determinant of health. The review of 21 studies, including 16 randomized controlled trials, found that unconditional cash transfers may not improve health services use. However, they lead to a large, clinically meaningful reduction in the likelihood of being sick by an estimated 27%. Unconditional cash transfers may also improve food security and dietary diversity. Children in recipient families are more likely to attend school, and the cash transfers may increase money spent on health care.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |pages=CD011135 |year=2017 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Liu |first2=Sze |last3=Walter |first3=Stefan  |last4=Pabayo |first4=Roman |last5=Saith |first5=Ruhi |last6=Lhachimi |first6=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the recommendations by the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health is expanding knowledge – particularly to health care workers.&lt;ref name="Farmer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=Paul E.|last2=Nizeye|first2=Bruce|last3=Stulac|first3=Sara|last4=Keshavjee|first4=Salmaan|year=2006|title=Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e449|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449|pmc=1621099|pmid=17076568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not addressed by the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, sexual orientation and gender identity are increasingly recognized as social determinants of health.&lt;ref name=pmid25602894&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=25602894 |title=The case for the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health to address gender identity |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=e58-62 |year=2015 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Veale |first2=Jaimie |doi=10.2105/ajph.2014.302373 |pmc=4330845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tannerella forsythia'' was discovered by and named after Dr. Anne Tanner who works at [[The Forsyth Institute]] located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

''T. forsythia'' has been identified in atherosclerotic lesions. Lee et al. found that infecting mice with ''T. forsythia'' induced foam cell formation and accelerated the formation of atherosclerotic lesions.&lt;ref&gt;[LEE HR, JUN HK, &amp; CHOI BK. (2014).

*August: Michael meets his future wife, Jodi Anne Centonze, at a dentist's office.  Shortly after meeting, they begin to date each other.
*Michael brings a medical malpractice suit against Dr. Stephen Igel, the ob/gyn who had been treating Terri. Jury finds the obstetrician had not properly diagnosed Terri's condition. The case is appealed.
*November: Settlement with Dr. Igel. $750k for Terri's care, $300k for himself.
*November 5: Testimony of Michael Schiavo indicates he is attending nursing classes at St. Pete Junior College in order to help his wife.

==1993==

*January: The medical malpractice suit against Terri's obstetrician is settled before an appeal is decided. Terri receives $750,000. Michael receives $300,000. Terri's award is placed in a trust fund controlled by a third party for her medical care.
*February 14: Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers disagree over the course of treatment and therapy for Terri Schiavo. Michael Schiavo claims that the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.  The parties are no longer on speaking terms following this event.
*July 29: The Schindlers begin to challenge Michael Schiavo's guardianship of Terri Schiavo and attempt to remove him as [[legal guardian]].

==1994==

*March 1: Guardian ad litem John H. Pecarek submits his report which states that Michael Schiavo acted appropriately and attentively toward Terri Schiavo.
*In March, Terri is moved to Palm Gardens of Largo, a skilled nursing facility in [[Seminole, Florida]].
*The administration of one nursing home attempts, unsuccessfully, to get a restraining order against Michael because he was demanding more attention for his wife at the expense of other patients' care.
*Michael accepts the diagnosis that Terri is in an irreversible persistent vegetative state. In consultation with Terri's physician, Schiavo halts most therapy for his wife.
*Terri develops a [[urinary tract infection]]. Following a doctor's recommendation, Michael chooses not to treat it. Michael enters a "[[do not resuscitate]]" order, which he later rescinds after the parents protest.

==1995==

*Michael begins his relationship with Jodi Centonze.

==1998==

*May: Michael Schiavo files a petition to discontinue feeding tube for Terri Schiavo. Terri's parents fight the petition.
*June: Richard Pearse, Esq. is appointed guardian ad litem for Terri Schiavo by the [[Circuit Court]] for [[Pinellas County, Florida]].
*September 11: Dr. Jeffrey Karp neurologically evaluates Terri and indicates that she "is in a chronic vegetative state" exhibiting "an absence of voluntary activity or cognitive behavior...inability to communicate or interact purposefully with her environment."  Karp also notes that "her chance of any improvement to a functional level is essentially zero."
*Dr. Gambone, Terri's primary care physician, informs guardian ad litem Richard Pearse that Dr. Karp's PVS diagnosis (and prognosis) is the medical consensus.
*November: Terri's parents become aware of the bone scan report that was performed in 1991. Terri's parents and Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]] claim the trauma shown in the bone scan was a result of Terri being abused by Michael. Provided with only the scan information, forensic pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden suggests a head injury caused the trauma. After learning Terri's full history, Dr. Baden agrees that the trauma is consistent with her cardiac arrest, fall, [[CPR]] attempts, and eventual [[resuscitation]]. The parents petition the Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court for a full evidentiary hearing to evaluate the new evidence. Judge [[George Greer]] denies the motion.
*December 29: The second [[guardian ad litem]], Richard Pearse, submits his report to the Pinellas-Pasco County Circuit Court.  Pearse concludes that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state with no possibility of improvement and that Michael Schiavo's decisions may be influenced by the potential to inherit what remains of Terri Schiavo's estate.  Due to a perceived lack of evidence for Terri's wishes, and questions regarding Michael Schiavo's credibility, Pearse recommends denying Michael Schiavo's petition to remove Terri's feeding tube.

==2000==

*Michael is issued a license for nursing by the State of Florida, Department of Health.
*February: As a result of Michael's petition in 1998, the court rules that Terri would choose to have the tube removed.
*April: Terri is transferred to Woodside Hospice in Pinellas Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehospice.org/WoodsideHoliday.htm thehospice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001==

*Dr. Ron Cranford, neurologist, assesses Terri's brain function as part of a court-ordered examination. His exam shows that Terri's cerebral cortex has been completely destroyed; he finds that her upper brain is 80% destroyed, and there is much damage to the lower brain.
*April 26: Terri's feeding tube is removed for the first time. It is reinserted two days later on an appeal by her parents.

==2002==

*A trial is held to determine whether or not new therapy treatments would help Terri restore any cognitive function.
:A new [[Computed axial tomography|CAT scan]] shows severe cerebral [[atrophy]]. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] shows no measurable brain activity.

:Five doctors are selected to provide their expert opinions to the trial. Schiavo's parents select Dr. William Maxfield, a retired radiologist, and Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]], a neurologist. Michael Schiavo selects neurologists Dr. Ron Cranford and Dr. Melvin Greer (no relation to Judge George Greer). The court selects neurologist Dr. Peter Bambakidis. These five doctors examine Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Schiavo herself.

:Dr. Cranford, Dr. Greer, and Dr. Bambakidis testify that Terri was in a persistent vegetative state. Dr. Maxfield and Dr. Hammesfahr testify that Schiavo was in a "minimally conscious state."

:Terri's parents videotape Terri for four and a half hours. The video is edited down to several clips totaling four and a half minutes.

:Judge Greer rules that Terri Schiavo is in a PVS and was beyond hope of significant improvement.

*Fall 2002: Jodi Centonze gives birth to her first child with Michael.
*November 22: Judge Greer denies a motion from Terri's parents for a full evidentiary hearing to evaluate new evidence, the 1990 bone scan, which had only recently come to their attention. Greer states that the issue of trauma twelve years earlier was irrelevant to the current case.
*Florida's Second District Court of Appeal reviews previous court records and upholds the trial court's decision.

== 2003 ==

* September 11: The Schindlers petition the Pinellas County court for the Sixth Judicial Circuit.  The petition asks the court to forestall any removal of the feeding tube for "eight weeks' therapy."  Accompanying the petition are five [[affidavit]]s: four from members of the Schindler family (presumably her mother, father, brother, and sister) and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon.  Additional affidavits from three "speech professionals" and two nurses are included.
*September 17: Judge Greer issues a nine-page court ruling, rejecting the petition.
* October 10: The final remaining appeal filed by the Schindlers is dismissed.
* October 15: Terri's feeding tube is removed for the second time.
* October 21: The Florida Legislature passes "Terri's Law." Governor [[Jeb Bush]] immediately orders the feeding tube reinserted.
* December: Dr. Jay Wolfson reports to Governor Bush, "within the testimony, as part of the hypotheticals presented, Schindler family members stated that even if (Terri) had told them of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn, they would not do it.  Throughout this painful and difficult trial, the family acknowledged that (Terri) was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/WolfsonReport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2004 ==

* Spring 2004: Jodi Centonze gives birth to her second child with Michael.
* May 19: Florida Judge W. Douglas Baird overturns "Terri's Law". The ruling is appealed.
* September 23: Florida Supreme Court agrees that "Terri's Law" is [[constitution|unconstitutional]].

* February 25: Judge George Greer orders Terri's feeding tube removed on March 18.
* March 11: Media tycoon [[Robert Herring (tycoon)|Robert Herring]] offers one million [[USD|dollars]] to Michael Schiavo if he agrees to waive his guardianship over Terri to her parents. Michael declines.
*March 17: Members of the [[Florida Legislature]] consider a bill that would make removing food and water from patients in a persistent vegetative state illegal without a living will. Although the bill is passed by the [[Florida House of Representatives]] by a vote of 78 to 37, the [[Florida Senate]] defeats a similar measure hours later, 21 to 18.
*March 17: U.S. Senators [[Bill Frist]] and [[Michael Enzi]] announce that Terri Schiavo would be called to testify before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] on March 28 in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. No one expects Terri to testify, but the move extends [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection]] to Terri, requiring reinsertion of her feeding tube.
*March 18: Greer strikes down the subpoena as unconstitutional and Terri's feeding tube is removed for the third and final time.
*March 20/21: [[U.S. Congress]] approves emergency legislation, the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]].
*March 21: Bob and Mary Schindler file a request for an emergency injunction with the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa.
*March 22: Judge James D. Whittemore refuses to order the feeding tube reinserted.
*March 22: Three Florida neurologists view 12 of Terri's [[computed tomography|CT]] scans. Dr. Leon Prockop says it was the "most severe brain damage I've seen." Dr. Walter Bradley says that he "doubts there's any activity going on in the higher levels of her brain." Dr. Michael T. Pulley says, "The chance that this person is going to recover is about zero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/nation/11213061.htm|title=KC Breaking News, Sports, Weather &amp; More - The Kansas City Star &amp; KansasCity.com The Kansas City Star|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*March 23: The Florida Senate again debates this proposed law, which is again rejected, 21 to 18.
:The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta denies the request to reinsert the feeding tube. The three-judge panel rules 2-1.

*March 23: Bob and Mary Schindler appeal again to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].
*March 24: The U.S. Supreme Court declines to grant [[certiorari]].  Judge Greer issues an injunction denying the Florida State government's right to have the Florida Department of Children &amp; Families take over Schiavo's care.
*March 27: Terri is given the [[Anointing of the Sick]] ("Last Rites").
*March 30: The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in [[Atlanta]] agrees to consider a petition by Mrs. Schiavo's parents to have a new hearing to decide whether the feeding tube should be reinserted. Later that day, the court denies the petition.

[[File:Health Care Spending in Switzerland Per Capita, 1998 to 2008.JPG|thumb|right|400px|This graph contrasts total health care spending with public spending, in [[US dollars]] adjusted for [[purchasing power parity]] in [[Switzerland]].]]

'''Two-tier healthcare''' is a situation in which a basic government-provided [[healthcare system]] provides basic care, and a secondary tier of care exists for those who can pay for additional, better quality or faster access.
Most countries have both publicly and privately funded healthcare, but the degree to which it creates a quality differential depends on the way the two systems are managed, funded, and regulated.

Some publicly funded universal healthcare systems deliver excellent service and the private system tends to be small and not highly differentiated. In other, typically poorer countries, the public health system is underfunded and overstretched, offering opportunities for private companies to deliver better-quality, albeit more expensive coverage.Chen, Zhang, &amp; Hua. (2015). Analysis of two-tier public service systems under a government subsidy policy. Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering, 90, 146-157.

==Canada==
{{Main|Healthcare in Canada}}
In Canada, there are private and public healthcare providers with complete patient freedom of choice between which doctors and facilities to use.

The public financing system, unofficially known as Medicare, consists of several different systems managed by each province or territory. The federal government distributes funds to the provinces for healthcare providing the provinces design their systems to meet certain criteria which they all do. Most people receiving care in Canada do not pay for their care. The medical provider gets paid a fixed fee for the care provided. The law bans the medical provider from charging patients to supplement their income from Medicare. Medical care providers can set their own fees that are higher than the Medicare reimbursement fee, but the patient must pay all the cost of care, not just the excess.

About 70% of Canada's healthcare funding is via the public system. Another 30% comes from private funding, divided approximately equally between out-of-pocket funding and private insurance, which may be complementary (meeting costs not covered by the public system such as the cost of prescription medicines, dental treatments and copayments) or supplementary (adding more choice of provider or providing faster access to care)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, financial disincentives that make private medicine for services that are covered by Medicare less economic.

Six of Canada's ten provinces used to ban private insurance for publicly insured services to inhibit queue jumping and so preserve fairness in the health care system. In 2005, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that in Quebec, such bans are unconstitutional if the waiting period for care is excessively long. However, this ruling only applies within the Province of Quebec. A second court challenge is currently underway to determine whether the prohibition of private parallel health care violates the patients' right to life, liberty, and security under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

Some private hospitals operating while the national healthcare plan was instituted (for example, the [[Shouldice Hernia Centre]] in [[Thornhill, Ontario]]) continue to operate, but they may not bill additional charges for medical procedures. (The Shouldice Hospital, however, has mandatory additional room charges not covered by public health insurance. That effectively places it in the "upper tier" of a two-tier system. Welfare recipients, for example, cannot be referred there.)

Clinics are usually private operations but may not bill additional charges. Private healthcare may also be supplied, both in uncovered fields and to foreigners.

[[Healthcare in Denmark]], although primarily subsidised by the government at the county and the national levels health, is supported by complementary insurance plans to cover elective services not covered by the public system; they also help cover copayments.

==France==
[[Healthcare in France]] is a system of private and public physicians, who largely draw their income from the government. There are public as well as private hospitals.

Patients pay a small [[copayment]] for certain aspects of care, but many people choose to cover the costs by taking out supplemental health insurance for which a small premium is payable each year.

Thus, France also has a mixed delivery system with complete patient freedom of supplier choice. There is a two-tier funding arrangement, with compulsory funding of core medical services from taxation, with optional private insurance for the cost of copayments.

==Germany==
[[Healthcare in Germany]] has multiple sickness funds, either publicly owned or not-for-profit mutuals. Membership of a sickness fund is compulsory for everyone except certain people earning an income above a certain level, who opt out of the insurance system altogether. Doctors are usually self-employed, and hospitals may be publicly owned, privately owned or not for profit.

==Ireland==
[[Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland]] is financed mainly by the state. However, all citizens have the option of buying additional private health insurance, provided by four companies. They include [[VHI]], a large publicly owned insurer, operating, like all other insurers, [[community rating]]; people are insured at the same basic rate regardless of health status. The other insurers are [[Glo Healthcare]], [[LAYA]] and [[Avivia]]. Also, much smaller restricted membership companies provide benefits for certain professions, such as police officers.

There are public as well as private hospitals.  Private patients are often treated in public hospitals, as all privately insured patients have an entitlement to use the publicly funded system.

==Netherlands==
[[Healthcare in the Netherlands]] is essentially single tier, with all persons accessing a common system of private and public providers with complete freedom of choice between providers. Insurers are all private companies. It is heavily subsidized from tax revenues and heavily regulated, with a common, regulated standard insurance policy coverage set nationwide for all providers and a more flexible top up insurance, which is less regulated and set by each company as it chooses.

Insurers set a standard price for each adult for the year throughout the country and must insure all people who apply for insurance at that price regardless of the age or health status of the applicant. An equalization fund, which is essentially a national sickness fund funded from a form of income tax on employers and employees, is used to pay for the health care of all children and to compensate insurers if they have more high risk profile clients than the other insurers.

Thus, Dutch insurers welcome the sick and the elderly because they are fully compensated for the higher-risk profile of these clients. People living in more expensive areas of the country have to pay higher premiums, since they get less compensation from the government because they can afford to pay more but the elderly and the sick pay the same premiums as everyone else in that region. Social insurance covers the insurance costs of those with limited incomes, such as the unemployed and the permanently disabled.

==Singapore==
[[Healthcare in Singapore]] uses a true two-tier system for both the provider network and the insurance funds. A government-sponsored and subsidized system of hospitals accepts all patients, with a guaranteed list of services. A parallel system of private hospitals provides services not available in public hospitals or available with extra amenities (such as private rooms and other boutique services).

Singapore uses a universal insurance fund in which all citizens are required to participate, as a baseline. Seniors and certain groups are subsidised in their membership in the universal basic insurance fund.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090228210450/http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/hcsystem.aspx?id=102]

Optional additional supplementary insurance funds are available for purchase for elective coverage, such as for plastic surgery or for extra amenities in hospital.

==Spain==
Private insurance, private hospitals and private management of public hospitals exist in Spain, and coexist with hospitals completely run by the government. Public insurance guarantees universal coverage, with no expenditure from patients other than a fraction of prescription drug cost. Some private hospitals are only accessible with private insurance. The system is regularly ranked amongst the world's best [http://www.expatica.com/es/healthcare/Getting-healthcare-in-Spain_101467.html]

==Switzerland==
Private health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in [[Healthcare in Switzerland|Switzerland]].  Insurance companies are required to sell the compulsory basic health insurance at cost, and individuals who cannot afford the premium (based on a premium-to-income ratio) are provided with public cash subsidies.  Public hospitals are subsidised, but there are also private hospitals that provide additional services, such as elective services.

In addition to the compulsory basic health insurance, optional complementary and supplementary private insurance plans are available for purchase.

==United Kingdom==
The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (or NHS) provides universal coverage to all residents of the [[United Kingdom]].

Private healthcare has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, and is used by about 8% of the population{{Citation needed|reason=Just updating an older passage to an actual cn tag|date=November 2017}}, generally as an add-on to NHS services and mostly obtained by employer funded insurance schemes. That is a taxable benefit to the employee, the value imputed by the tax authorities as income to the beneficiary. Because NHS services are so comprehensive, there are many areas in which the private sector usually does not compete and private insurers almost always refuse to fund. Childbirth and perinatal services are good examples.

Conversely, there are some areas where the NHS does not offer free treatment ([[cosmetic surgery]] for vanity purposes, for example) and so the private sector offers a pay-for-service alternative.

Historically, avoiding waiting lists was the main reason that patients opted out of NHS treatment and into private care. Queues of many months are common. NHS Consultants, who can run both NHS and private services during their NHS contracts, used to be in charge of waiting lists and had a financial incentive to keep the public waiting list long, to ensure a stream of private income to the private business.

Since the Blair government reforms of the NHS, strict rules apply to waiting lists (see [[hospital choice in the NHS]]). That and the allocation of better funding in hospitals both reduced waiting times significantly. Most hospital patients are in fact not admitted from a list at all, and those that do, on average, wait less than 9 weeks. Nobody should wait more than 18 weeks. The 18 weeks is not dead time because it includes the time taken to book a first appointment, to conduct all the tests, for the doctor and patient to agree on the desired treatment, and to book and execute an operation or commence the treatment regime. A patient not seen in the 18-week period without just cause has the legal right to go private at the NHS's expense.{{says who?|date=May 2015}}

As a result of these improvements, long waiting times reduced, and the private healthcare sector now sells its surplus capacity to the NHS. [[Dentistry]] is an area where many practitioners prefer to work privately (because they can set their own fees). [[NHS dentistry]] can then be patchy, and some people may find that private dentistry is the only practical option open to them in their locality.

There has always been a degree of private medicine conducted within NHS hospitals, with private work being done in those hospitals and the patient being accommodated in segregated accommodation. Until recently, few NHS patients were ever treated in private hospitals. In the English NHS, however, there has been greater willingness to outsource some work to the private sector, and so some NHS patients do sometimes gain access to private health care facilities at public expense. The equivalent NHS operations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland do not often fund treatment outside of their own facilities.

Whether the NHS funds treatment in a private hospital is a decision for the local commissioning health authority based on formal service contracts.

==United States==
{{further|Health care in the United States|Obamacare}}
The United States has a two-tier health system, but most of the population cannot gain access to the public provision tiers. Healthcare provided directly by the government is limited to military and veteran families and to certain Native American tribes. Certain cities and towns also provide free care directly but only to those who cannot afford to pay. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] pay for health care obtained at private facilities but only for the elderly, disabled, and children in poor families. Since enacting the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in 2010, Medicaid has been substantially expanded, and federal subsidies are available for low- to middle-income individuals and families to purchase private health insurance.

The debate over [[healthcare reform in the United States]] has included a proposal for a [[public option]] or [[Medicare for all]], a government-run insurance program, available to all US citizens, to compete with or replace private insurance plans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2786">The '''World Mental Health Survey Initiative''' is a collaborative project by [[World Health Organization]], [[Harvard University]], [[University of Michigan]], and country-based researchers worldwide to coordinate the analysis and implementation of [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]] of [[Mental_disorder|mental]] and [[Behavioral disorder|behavioral]] disorders and substance abuse in all [[World_Health_Organization#Regional_offices|WHO Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Mental Health Survey Initiative|url=https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh/|website=Harvard Medical School|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mental Health Survey Initiative|url=https://www.src.isr.umich.edu/international/world-mental-health-survey-initiative/|website=University of Michigan|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aim ==
It is estimated that the burden of mental and addictive disorders are among the highest in the world with expected increase over the next decades. However, those estimations are not based on [[Cross-sectional_study|cross-sectional]] [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]], rather, they are mainly based on [[literature reviews]] and isolated studies.
The WMH Survey Initiative aim is to accurately address the global burden of mental disorders by obtaining accurate cross-sectional information about the prevalences and correlates of mental and behavioral disorders as well as substance abuse, allowing for evaluation of risk factors and study of patterns of service use in order to target appropriate interventions.

== Collaborators ==
Collaborators in this survey come from all WHO regions of the world, with 27 participating countries.
