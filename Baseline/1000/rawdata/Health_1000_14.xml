[[Image:H1N1 June 3 2009 USA.svg|thumb|400px|Confirmed cases by state, June 3, 2009]]

This article covers the chronology of the 2009 novel influenza A ([[H1N1]]) pandemic. Flag icons denote the first announcements of confirmed cases by the respective nation-states, their first deaths (and other major events such as their first intergenerational cases, cases of [[zoonosis]], and the start of national vaccination campaigns), and relevant sessions and announcements of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[European Union]] (and its agency the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]]),
and the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC).

Unless otherwise noted, references to terms like S-OIV, H1N1 and such, all refer to this new A(H1N1) strain and not to sundry other strains of H1N1 which are endemic in humans, birds and pigs.

==Summary==
&lt;!--Key milestones only --&gt;&lt;!--Do not remove anything without a talk in the talk page --&gt;
&lt;!--Please stop putting North Korea, if it has confirmed cases cite the references. Even if there are rumors about it, don't say north korea has the new flu--&gt;

The 5-SPICE framework was developed by clinicians and researchers from [[Partners In Health]], [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]] in Boston, MA.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palazuelos|first=Daniel|author2=Kyla Ellis |author3=Dana DeEun Im |author4=Matthew Peckarsky |author5=Daniel Schwartz|title=5-SPICE: the application of an original framework for community health worker program design, quality improvement and research agenda setting|journal=Global Health Action|date=April 3, 2013|volume=6|doi=10.3402/gha.v6i0.19658|pmid=23561023|pmc=3617878|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework lays out a model for integrating community health workers into public health systems, learning from the experiences Partners In Health and partner organizations at their project sites in resource-poor settings around the world.&lt;ref name="pih"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Workers|url=http://www.pih.org/priority-programs/community-health-workers/about|publisher=Partners In Health|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-SPICE draws upon experiences from Haiti, Rwanda, Lesotho, Liberia, Nepal, Mali, and elsewhere, where CHWs have been employed to improve patient outcomes and overcome personnel shortages.&lt;ref name="pih_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Work|url=http://www.pih.org/our-work|publisher=Partners In Health|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework allows for all stakeholders in a community health program to participate in discussions and analyses to strengthen the impact of CHWs.

==Background==
5-SPICE allows for all stakeholders in a community health program to participate in discussions and analyses to strengthen the impact of community health workers.

The name 5-SPICE is derived from Chinese cuisine emphasizing the balance between inputs and elements. The five main elements form an acronym:
*Supervision (especially management plans and structures)
*Partners (especially ownership and stewardship)
*Incentives (part of the larger theme of motivation)
*Choice (how CHWs are recruited to work and why they take the job)
*Education (what CHWs bring to their job and how they are trained) &lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

These elements are not a static list, but a way to holistically analyze how core programmatic elements affect each other in the field. In the [[Freire, Paulo|Freirean]] tradition of awareness, the 5-SPICE model emphasizes facilitated discussion and contemplation among stakeholders, particularly CHWs, to maximize program outputs. Ultimately, the 5-SPICE framework allows program implementers to study the relationship between the health system and the local community.

Other CHW program frameworks exist, such as the CHW Assessment and Improvement Matrix (AIM) developed by the USAID-funded Health Care Improvement (HCI) project.&lt;ref name="hciproject"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Worker Assessment and Improvement Matrix (CHW AIM): A Toolkit for Improving CHW Programs and Services|url=http://www.hciproject.org/node/2359|publisher=USAID|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-SPICE complements these other frameworks by providing an acronym that condenses the many elements discussed in other frameworks into an easy-to-remember heuristic, allowing for more effective and efficient assessments that are exploratory rather than prescriptive.

==Scholarly Dissemination==

The 5-SPICE framework was first formally introduced in an April 2013 publication in [[Global Health Action]], in an article entitled “5-SPICE: the application of an original framework for community health worker program design, quality improvement and research agenda setting.”&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;  The framework was subsequently presented at the 2013 Consortium of Universities for Global Health Conference,&lt;ref name=CUGH&gt;{{cite web|title=5-SPICE: An Original Framework for Community Health Worker Program Design, Quality Improvement and Research Agenda Setting|url=http://cugh.conferencespot.org/APP_TECH.34/APP_TECH.34/1|publisher=Consortium of Universities for Global Health|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the 2013 Swedish Society of Medicine’s annual conference, Global Health—Beyond 2015.&lt;ref name=Sweden&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond 2015|url=http://www.sls.se/GlobalHealth/Om-konferensen/Editorial/|publisher=Swedish Medical Society|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article has also been accepted for presentation at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the  [[American Public Health Association]].&lt;ref name=APHA&gt;{{cite web|title=A unique non-linear chw program framework for quality improvement|url=https://apha.confex.com/apha/141am/webprogram/Paper284734.html|publisher=APHA|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH)''', also known as Women’s Health Australia or Women’s Health of Australia (WHoA!), is an ongoing population-based survey examining the health of over 50,000 Australian women. The study is funded by the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government Department of Health]] and is a collaborative endeavour conducted by staff and investigators at The [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and The [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health|url=http://alswh.org.au/|publisher=Women's Health Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Director is Professor Gita Mishra, the previous Director was [[Annette Dobson]]

== Method ==

In 1996, women in three age groups (born 1973-78, 1946–51 and 1921–26) were randomly selected from the national [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] database. These women were sent an invitation by mail to participate in the study. Over 40,000 women responded and agreed to participate. These women represented 2-3% of women in their age groups living in urban, rural and remote areas of Australia at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Australian Associated Press Pty Limited (2010)|title=Extra funding for women's health study|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/extra-funding-for-womens-health-study-20101229-199ur.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media 29/12/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Women’s Health of Australia (WHoA!) was launched. WHoA! was developed to recruit an additional cohort of women aged 18–23. Over 17,000 women were recruited using social media.&lt;br /&gt;
 
The primary method of data collection employed by ALSWH is self-completed surveys. ALSWH also includes a qualitative data set, where participants are asked to write anything they feel is important to their health and wellbeing in a free response space at the end of the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rich, J.L.|author2=Chojenta, C.|author3=Loxton, D.|last-author-amp=yes |date=2013|title=Quality, Rigour and Usefulness of Free-Text Comments Collected by a Large Population Based Longitudinal Study - ALSWH|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0068832|work=PLOS ONE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

The ALSWH study assesses:
* Physical and mental health (including well-being, major diagnoses and symptoms, determinants and consequences of chronic disease)
* Use of health services (general practitioners, specialist and other visits, access and satisfaction, cultural appropriateness)
* Health behaviours and risk factors (weight and exercise, diet and eating disorders, body image, smoking, alcohol and other drugs)
* Time use (including paid and unpaid work, family roles, leisure, social support, aspirations and financial resources)
* Socio-demographic factors (location, education, employment and family composition)
* Violence (physical and sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, harassment, psychological and abuse of older women)
* Life stages and key events (such as childbirth, menopause, major illness, falls and fractures, divorce, widowhood, dementia and bereavement).

== Substudies ==

As well as completing the main surveys, participants are occasionally invited to participate in substudies that aim to examine selected issues in more depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Substudies &amp; Analyses|url=http://www.alswh.org.au/substudies-and-analyses/substudies|work=The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health|publisher=Women's Health Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide range of topics has been covered, including:
* Sleeping difficulties and disturbances
* Domestic violence
* Urinary incontinence
* Retirement
* Caring
* Breast cancer
* Experiences of motherhood
* Future plans of young women
* Alcohol use during pregnancy
* Weight change at menopause
* Prenatal and postnatal depression
* Menopausal symptoms and diet
* Contraception
* Adverse pregnancy outcomes – miscarriage, preterm delivery and stillbirth.

== Data linkage ==

ALSWH has approval to anonymously link survey data with a number of national and state-based administrative datasets. Currently these approvals include the National Death Index, Medicare data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Health - Longitudinal Study|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/phd-women-longitudinal.htm|work=Department of Health|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; state-based cancer registries, perinatal data collections and hospital admission datasets. The aim of linking to these datasets is to provide new insights into the health and health service use of Australian women, taking into account individual level differences in socioeconomic, behavioural, environmental and other risk factors. In the context of a changing health system, it is important to be able to monitor and evaluate the impact and outcomes of health service policy and practice.

== Outcomes ==

The [[longitudinal study]] design ensures that the same women are followed over many years so researchers can observe changes in their health, clarify cause-and-effect relationships, and assess the effects of changes in policy and practice. ALSWH can provide information about the health of women across the lifespan. This information has assisted federal and state governments to plan for the future and to develop and evaluate [[health policy]] and practice relevant to Australian women. The study was used extensively in the 2010 National Women’s Health Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Women's Health Policy|url=http://www.health.gov.au/womenshealthpolicy|work=Department of Health|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALSWH has collaborated with numerous investigators, universities and organisations around the world. The findings from ALSWH have been reported in over 100 reports to the government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Reports|url=http://www.alswh.org.au/publications-and-reports/major-reports|work=Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health|publisher=Women's Health Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and been included in more than 400 academic publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Published Papers|url=http://www.alswh.org.au/publications-and-reports/published-papers|work=The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health|publisher=Women's Health Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7509">'''Cervical dilation'''  (or cervical dilatation) is the opening of the [[cervix]], the entrance to the uterus, during [[childbirth]], [[miscarriage]], [[abortion|induced abortion]], or gynecological surgery.  Cervical dilation may occur naturally, or may be induced by surgical or medical means.

== Childbirth ==
In the later stages of pregnancy, the cervix may already have opened up to 1–3&amp;nbsp;cm (or more in rarer circumstances), but during [[childbirth|labor]], repeated [[uterine contraction]]s lead to further widening of the cervix to about 6 centimeters.  From that point, pressure from the presenting part (head in vertex births or bottom in breech births), along with uterine contractions, will dilate the cervix to 10 centimeters, which is "complete." Cervical dilation is accompanied by [[Cervical effacement|effacement]], the thinning of the cervix.

General guidelines for cervical dilation:
* Latent phase: 0–3 centimeters
* Active Labor: 4–7 centimeters
* Transition: 8–10 centimeters
* Complete: 10 centimeters. Delivery of the infant takes place shortly after this stage is reached (although the mother does not always push right away.)

=== Symptoms ===
During [[pregnancy]], the os (opening) of the cervix is blocked by a thick plug of [[mucus]] to prevent bacteria from entering the uterus. During dilation, this plug is loosened. It may come out as one piece, or as thick mucus discharge from the vagina. When this occurs, it is an indication that the cervix is beginning to dilate, although not all women will notice this mucus plug being released.

[[Bloody show]] is another indication that the cervix is dilating. Bloody show usually comes along with the mucus plug, and may continue throughout labor, making the mucus tinged pink, red or brown. Fresh, red blood is usually not associated with dilation, but rather serious complications such as [[placental abruption]], or [[placenta previa]].  Red blood in small quantities often also follows an exam.

The pain experienced during dilation is similar to that of [[menstruation]] (although markedly more intense), as period pains are thought to be due to the passing of [[endometrium]] through the cervix. Most of the pain during labor is caused by the uterus contracting to dilate the cervix.

=== Induced dilation in childbirth===
[[Prostaglandin]]s (P2 and [[Prostaglandin E2|PGE2]]) contribute to cervical ripening and dilation. The body produces these hormones naturally. Sometimes prostaglandins in synthesized forms are applied directly to the cervix to induce labor.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="eMed"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rai | first = Jodie |author2=James R.

ACOG's findings conclude that the collagen softening properties of misoprostol could be absorbed through the cervix and vaginal vault up into the low transverse scar of a typical cesarean section, and significantly increase the risk of uterine rupture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=ACOG Committee Opinion No. 342: induction of labor for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=465–8 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16880321 |doi= 10.1097/00006250-200608000-00045|url=http://www.greenjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16880321 |format=  &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AACOG+Committee+Opinion+No.+342%3A+induction+of+labor+for+vaginal+birth+after+cesarean+delivery&amp;as_publication=Obstet+Gynecol&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |author1= American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice}} {{dead link|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prostaglandins are also present in human [[semen]], and [[sexual intercourse]] is commonly recommended for promoting the onset of labor, although the limited data available makes the effectiveness of this method uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tenore JL |title=Methods for cervical ripening and induction of labor |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=67 |issue=10 |pages=2123–8 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12776961 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030515/2123.html |accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other means of natural cervical ripening include [[nipple stimulation]], which produces [[oxytocin]], a hormone which is necessary for uterine contractions. Nipple stimulation can be performed manually, by use of a [[breast pump]], or by suckling. Henci Goer, in her comprehensive book, The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth, details how this practice was researched in two separate studies of 100 and 200 women in the mid nineteen-eighties. Women were assigned randomly to two groups. In one group, nipples were stimulated for one-hour sessions, three times per day. In the other group, women were to avoid any form of nipple stimulation or sexual intercourse. The researchers concluded in both studies that nipple stimulation could indeed ripen the cervix and in some cases induce [[uterine contractions]]. Goer further notes that in the smaller study, an [[external fetal monitor]] was used, and no [[uterine hyperstimulation]] was noted.&lt;ref&gt;The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer,1999,{{ISBN|0-399-52517-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|failed=y|date=August 2012}}

Cervical dilation may be induced mechanically by placing devices inside the cervix that will expand while in place.  A [[balloon catheter]] may be used.  Other products include [[laminaria]] stick (made of dried seaweed) or synthetic [[hygroscopic]] materials, which expand when placed in a moist environment.&lt;ref name="eMed" /&gt;

== In hysteroscopy==
{{anchor|dilator}}
In [[hysteroscopy]], the diameter of the hysteroscope is generally too large to conveniently pass the [[cervix]] directly, thereby necessitating cervical dilation to be performed prior to insertion. Cervical dilation can be performed by temporarily stretching the cervix with a series of ''(cervical) dilators'' of increasing diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/laparoscopy.pdf Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy.] A Guide for Patients, Revised 2012.

== Measurement ==
Child mortality refers to number of child deaths under the age of 5 per 1000 live births. However, the child mortality could be simplified into more specific terms such as [[Prenatal development|prenatal]], [[Prenatal development|perinatal]], [[Neonatal]], [[Infant|infancy]] and [[Under 5 Infant Mortality|under 5]]. Prenatal: child death before the birth, Perinatal: child death before one week of birth, Neonatal: child death before 28 days of birth, Infancy: child death before 1st birthday, and child mortality under 5 refer to any deaths from birth to the 5th birthday.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884617656|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=1944-|first=Weeks, John Robert,|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth |location=Boston, MA|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Infant mortality}}
The leading causes of death of children under five include:

* [[Preterm birth]] complications (18%)
* [[Pneumonia]] (16%)
* Interpartum-related events (12%)
*[[Neonatal sepsis]] (7%)
*[[Diarrhea]] (8%)
*[[Malaria]]  (5%)
*[[Malnutrition in children|Malnutrition]] and Under nutrition

There is variation of child mortality around the world; countries that are in the second or third stage of the Demographic Transition Mode ([[Demographic transition model|DTM]]) have higher rates of child mortality than countries in the fourth or fifth state of the DTM. [[Chad]] infant mortality is about 96 per 1,000 live births. And developed country such as Japan [[infant mortality]] is about 2.2 per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; In 2010, there were estimated to 7.6 million child deaths around the world and most of it occurred in [[Developing country|less developed countries]] and 4.7&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/docview/1023015914?pq-origsite=summon|title=Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality: an updated systematic analysis for 2010 with time trends since 2000|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; million died from infection and disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Child mortality isn’t only caused by infection and disorder, it is also caused by premature birth, birth defect, new born infection, birth complication, and disease like [[malaria]], sepsis, and diarrhea.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldvision.org/health-news-stories/child-mortality-causes-solutions|title=Child mortality: Top causes, best solutions {{!}} World Vision|date=2016-01-13|work=World Vision|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less developed countries, [[malnutrition]] is the main source of child mortality.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 child deaths before the age of 5 and nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.unicef.org/child-survival/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child survival is a field of [[public health]] concerned with reducing child mortality. Child survival 
interventions are designed to address the most common causes of child deaths that occur, which include [[diarrhea]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and neonatal conditions.  Of the portion of children under the age of 5 alone, an estimated 5.6 million children die each year mostly from such preventable causes.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.data.unicef.org/child-mortality/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child survival strategies and interventions are in line with the fourth [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which focused on reducing child mortality by 2/3 of children under five before the year 2015. In 2015, the MDGs were replaced with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), which aim to end these deaths by 2030. In order to achieve SDG targets, progress must be accelerated in more than 1/4 of all countries (most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa) in order to achieve targets for under-5 mortality, and in 60 countries (many in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia) to achieve targets for neonatal mortality.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt; Without accelerated progress, 60 million children under age 5 will die between 2017 and 2030, about half of which would be newborns.

=== Low-cost interventions ===
Two-thirds of child deaths are preventable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index.html UNICEF - Young child survival and development].&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the children who die each year could be saved by low-tech, evidence-based, cost-effective measures such as [[vaccine]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets, improved family care and [[breastfeeding]] practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/mdg/childmortality.html|title=UNICEF  - Goal: Reduce child mortality|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[oral rehydration therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/release35/en/|title=WHO - New formula for oral rehydration salts will save millions of lives|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering women, removing financial and social barriers to accessing basic services, developing innovations that make the supply of critical services more available to the poor and increasing local accountability of health systems are policy interventions that have allowed health systems to improve equity and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2012.pdf|title=Surveys - UNICEF MICS|website=www.childinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and [[diarrheal diseases]] can be reduced by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with soap. This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|date=May 2003|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proven, cost-effective interventions can save the lives of millions of children per year. The UN Vaccine division as of 2014 supported 36% of the world's children in order to best improve their survival chances, yet still, low-cost immunization interventions do not reach 30 million children despite success in reducing polio, tetanus, and measles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-05-01|title=Role of vaccine manufacturers in developing countries towards global healthcare by providing quality vaccines at affordable prices|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14601749|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|language=en|volume=20|pages=37–44|doi=10.1111/1469-0691.12568|issn=1198-743X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measles and tetanus still kill more than 1 million children under 5 each year. Vitamin A supplementation costs only $0.02 cents for each capsule and given 2-3 times a year will prevent blindness and death. Although vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by 12 to 24 per cent, only 70 per cent of targeted children were reached in 2015.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt; Between 250,000 and 500,000 children become blind every year, with 70 percent of them dying within 12 months. [[Oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT) is an effective treatment for lost liquids through diarrhea; yet only 4 in 10 (44 per cent) of children ill with diarrhea are treated with ORT.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt;

Essential newborn care - including immunizing mothers against tetanus, ensuring clean delivery practices in a hygienic birthing environment, drying and wrapping the baby immediately after birth, providing necessary warmth, and promoting immediate and continued breastfeeding, immunization, and treatment of infections with antibiotics - could save the lives of 3 million newborns annually. [[Improved sanitation]] and access to clean [[drinking water]] can reduce childhood infections and diarrhea. Over 30% of the world's population does not have access to basic [[sanitation]], and 844 million people use unsafe sources of drinking water.&lt;ref name="UNICEF WASH"&gt;[web=https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/overview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efforts ===
Agencies promoting and implementing child survival activities worldwide include [[UNICEF]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s; major child survival donors worldwide include the [[World Bank]], the British Government's [[Department for International Development]], the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. In the United States, most non-governmental child survival agencies belong to the [[CORE Group]], a coalition working, through collaborative action, to save the lives of young children in the world's poorest countries.

== Epidemiology ==
Child mortality has been dropping as each country reaches a high stage of DTM. From 2000 to 2010, child mortality has dropped from 9.6 million to 7.6 million. In order to reduce child mortality rates, there needs to be better education, higher standards of healthcare and more caution in childbearing. Child mortality could be reduced by attendance of professionals at birth and by breastfeeding and through access to clean water, sanitation, and immunization.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In 2016, the world average was 41 (4.1%), down from 93 (9.3%) in 1990.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; This is equivalent to 5.6 million children less than five years old dying in 2016.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

===Variation===

Huge disparities in under-5 mortality rates exist. Globally, the risk of a child dying in the country with the highest under-5 mortality rate is about 60 times higher than in the country with the lowest under-5 mortality rate.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rates in the world: All six countries with rates above 100 deaths per 1,000 live births are in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

Furthermore, approximately 80% of under-5 deaths occur in only two regions: sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; 6 countries account for half of the global under-5 deaths, namely, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and China.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; India and Nigeria alone account for almost a third (32 per cent) of the global under-five deaths.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

Likewise, there are disparities between wealthy and poor households in developing countries. According to a [[Save the Children]] paper, children from the poorest households in [[India]] are three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than those from the richest households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm Inequalities in child survival: looking at wealth and other socio-economic disparities in developing countries] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607200429/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child survival rate of nations varies with factors such as [[fertility rate]] and [[income distribution]]; the change in distribution shows a strong correlation between child survival and income distribution as well as fertility rate, where increasing child survival allows the average income to increase as well as the average fertility rate to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Rosling shows the best stats you've ever seen|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html|work=TED talks|publisher=TED Conferences|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clinical coder''' – also known as '''clinical coding officer''', '''diagnostic coder''', '''medical coder''', '''nosologist'''  or '''medical records technician''' – is a [[Health information management|health information professional]] whose main duties are to analyse [[medical record|clinical statements]] and assign standard codes using a [[medical classification|classification system]]. The data produced are an integral part of [[health information management]], and are used by local and national governments, private healthcare organizations and international agencies for various purposes, including medical and health services research, [[epidemiology|epidemiological studies]], health resource allocation, [[case mix]] management, [[public health]] programming, [[medical billing]], and public education.

For example, a clinical coder may use a set of published codes on medical diagnoses and procedures, such as the [[ICD-10|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) or the [[HCPCS|Common Coding System for Healthcare Procedures]] (HCPCS), for reporting to the [[health insurance]] provider of the recipient of the care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to Health Insurance Billing|author=Marie A. Moisio|year=2000|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1207-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author = Michelle A. Green and JoAnn C. Rowell
  |title = Understanding Health Insurance, A Guide to Billing and Reimbursement, 10e
  |publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]
  |year = 2011
  |isbn = 978-1-111-03518-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The use of standard codes allows insurance providers to map equivalencies across different service providers who may use different terminologies or abbreviations in their written claims forms, and be used to justify reimbursement of fees and expenses. The codes may cover topics related to [[Diagnostic code|diagnoses]], [[Procedure code|procedures]], [[pharmaceutical code|pharmaceuticals]] or [[Topographical code|topography]]. The medical notes may also be divided into specialities for example [[cardiology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[nephrology]], [[neurology]] , [[pulmonology]] or [[orthopedic]] care.

A clinical coder therefore requires a good knowledge of [[medical terminology]], [[anatomy and physiology]], a basic knowledge of clinical procedures and diseases and injuries and other conditions, medical illustrations, clinical documentation (such as medical or surgical reports and patient charts), legal and ethical aspects of health information, health data standards, classification conventions, and computer- or paper-based data management, usually as obtained through formal education and/or on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. ''Classifying health workers: Medical records and health information technicians''. Geneva, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;Department of Human Services, Victoria, Australia. [http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/ahs/archive/hdss/13-19720.htm#clinical Clinical Coders Creed.] ''Health Data Standards and Systems Bulletin'', Issue 13, 19 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
The basic task of a clinical coder is to classify medical and health care concepts using a standardised [[medical classification|classification]]. Most clinical coders are employed in coding [[inpatient]] episodes of care.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, [[Death|mortality]] events, [[outpatient]] episodes, [[general practitioner]] visits and [[population health]] studies can all be coded.

Clinical coding has three key phases: a) Abstraction; b) Assignment; and c) Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wooding A |title=Clinical coders and decision making |journal=HIM J |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=79–83 |year=2004 |pmid=18490784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstraction===
The abstraction phase involves reading the entire record of the [[reason for encounter|health encounter]] and analysing the information to determine what condition(s) the patient had, what caused it and how it was treated. The information comes from a variety of sources within the [[medical record]], such as clinical notes, laboratory and radiology results, and operation notes.

===Assignment===
The assignment phase has two parts: finding the appropriate code(s) from the classification for the abstraction; and entering the code into the system being used to collect the coded data.

===Review===
Reviewing the code set produced from the assignment phase is very important. Clinical coder must ask themselves, "does this code set fairly represent what happened to this patient in this health encounter at this facility?" By doing this, clinical coders are checking that they have covered everything that they must, but not used extraneous codes. For health encounters that are funded through a [[case mix]] mechanism, the clinical coder will also review the [[diagnosis-related group]] (DRG) to ensure that it does fairly represent the health encounter.

==Competency levels==
Clinical coders may have different competency levels depending on the specific tasks and employment setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker S |title=Capturing health information—a perspectives paper |journal=HIM J |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=13–22 |year=2006 |pmid=18195424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entry-level / trainee coder===
An entry level coder has completed (or nearly completed) an introductory training program in using clinical classifications. Depending on the country; this program may be in the form of a certificate, or even a degree; which has to be earned before the trainee is allowed to start coding. All trainee coders will have some form of continuous, on-the-job training; often being overseen by a more senior coder. 

===Intermediate level coder===
An intermediate level coder has acquired the skills necessary to code many cases independently. Coders at this level are also able to code cases with incomplete information. They have a good understanding of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] along with disease processes. Intermediate level coders have their work audited periodically by an Advanced coder.

===Advanced level / senior coder===
Advanced level and senior coders are authorized to code all cases including the most complex. Advanced coders will usually be credentialed and will have several years of experience. An advanced coder is also able to train entry-level coders.

===Nosologist===
{{main|Nosology}}
A nosologist understands how the classification is underpinned. Nosologists consult nationally and internationally to resolve issues in the classification and are viewed as experts who can not only code, but design and deliver education, assist in the development of the classification and the rules for using it.

Nosologists are usually expert in more than one classification, including morbidity, mortality and casemix. In some countries the term "nosologist" is used as a catch-all term for all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-11/nosologist Nosologist.] ''Popular Science'', posted 11.11.2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification types==
Clinical coders may use many different classifications, which fall into two main groupings: statistical classifications and nomenclatures.

===Statistical classification===
{{Main|Medical classification|Procedural classification}}

A statistical classification, such as ICD-10 or [[DSM-5]], will bring together similar clinical concepts, and group them into one category. This allows the number of categories to be limited so that the classification does not become too big, but still allows statistical analysis. An example of this is in [[ICD-10]] at code I47.1. The code title (or [[rubric]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241548342|page=19|edition=10th revision, 2010|ref=Footnote 1|chapter=3. How to use the ICD|quote=In the context of the ICD, "rubric" denotes either a three-character category or a four-character subcategory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Supraventricular tachycardia]]. However, there are several other clinical concepts that are also classified here. Amongst them are paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, auricular tachycardia and nodal tachycardia.

===Nomenclature===
With a [[nomenclature]], for example [[SNOMED CT]], there is a separate listing and code for every clinical concept. So, in the tachycardia example above, each type and clinical term for tachycardia would have its own code listed. This makes nomenclatures unwieldy for compiling health statistics.

==Education and professional qualification==
In some countries, clinical coders may seek voluntary [[Certification and Accreditation|certification or accreditation]] through assessments conducted by professional associations, health authorities or, in some instances, universities.&lt;ref name="Bramley"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bramley | first1 = M | last2 = Reid | first2 = B.  | year = | title = Evaluation standards for clinical coder training programs | url = http://www.himaa.org.au/members/journal/HIMJ_36_3_2007/Bramey%20and%20Reid%20Evaluation%20standards%20for%20clinical%20coder%20training%20programs.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Health Information Management Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 3| page = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The options available to the coder will depend on the country,&lt;ref name="Bramley" /&gt; and, occasionally, even between states within a country.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===United Kingdom===
Clinical coders start as trainees, and there are no conversion courses for coders [[immigration|immigrating]] to the [[United Kingdom]].

The [[National Clinical Coding Qualification (UK)|National Clinical Coding Qualification]] (NCCQ) is an exam for experienced coders, and is recognised by the four health agencies of the UK.

&lt;!-- Countries have been listed in the order they appear in paragraph two of the lead section at the United Kingdom article --&gt;
====England====
In [[England]], a novice coder will complete the national standards course written by [[NHS Digital]] within 6 months of being in post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Clinical Coding Training Handbook 2016-17|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160921135209/http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/data/clinicalcoding/trainingaccred/sc_rc_hbk1617.pdf#page=3|publisher=Clinical Classifications Service|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will then start working towards the NCCQ. 

Three years after passing the NCCQ, two further professional qualifications are made available to the coder in the form of NHS Digital's clinical coding auditor and trainer programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delen: Home: CLINICAL CODING AUDITOR PROGRAMME|url=https://hscic.kahootz.com/connect.ti/t_c_home/view?objectId=297779|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delen: Home: CLINICAL CODING TRAINER PROGRAMME|url=https://hscic.kahootz.com/connect.ti/t_c_home/view?objectId=297747|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In 2015, [[NHS National Services Scotland|National Services Scotland]], in collaboration with Health Boards, launched the Certificate of Technical Competence (CTC) in Clinical Coding (Scotland). Awarded by the Institute of Health Records &amp; Information Management (IHRIM); the aims of the certificate include supporting staff new to clinical coding, and providing a standardised framework of clinical coding training across NHS Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate of Technical Competence in Clinical Coding (Scotland)|url=http://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Terminology-Services/Terminology-Advice-and-Support/Publicity-20170802-CTC.PDF|website=ISD Services|publisher=NHS Scotland|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
As of 2016; the typical qualification for an entry-level medical coder in the United States is completion of a diploma or certificate, or, where they are offered, an associate degree. The diploma, certificate, or degree will usually always include an Internet-based and/or in-person [[internship]], at some form of a medical office or facility, at the conclusion. Some form of on-the-job training, or at least oversight, is also usually provided in the first months on the job, until the coder can earn an intermediate or advanced level of certification and accumulate time on the job. For further academic training, a baccalaureate or master's degree in medical information technology, or a related field, can be earned by those who wish to advance to a supervisory or academic role. That option would be recommended for those wishing to teach medical billing or coding at a college or university, community college, or technical or vocational institute, or who wish to become heads of medical billing and coding departments, especially if the doctor's office or clinic, or other facility (among other working options, a medical school or hospital, a skilled nursing facility or other nursing home, a psychiatric facility, an assisted or independent living facility, a rehabilitation facility, a rest home or domiciliary or boarding house, etc.) is very large and receives complex cases, such as a referral facility or a Level I trauma teaching hospital center. A [[nosologist]] (medical coding expert) in the U.S. will usually be certified by either AHIMA or the AAPC (often both) at their highest level of certification and specialty inpatient and/or outpatient certification (pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, gerontology, oncology are among those offered by AHIMA and/or the AAPC), have at least 3-5 years of intermediate experience beyond entry-level certification and employment, and often holds an associate, bachelor's, or graduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://icc.edu/academics/catalog/health-careers/medical-coder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midstate.edu/programs/healthinformationtechnology.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midwesttech.edu/Program-Description/medical-coder-course-description.html&lt;/ref&gt;   

The [[AAPC (healthcare)|AAPC]] offers the following entry-level certifications in the U.S.: Certified Professional Coder (CPC); which tests on most areas of medical coding, and also the Certified Inpatient Coder (CIC) and Certified Outpatient Coder (COC). Also in the [[American Health Information Management Association]] (AHIMA) offers the entry-level Certified Coding Associate (CCA); which is, like the AAPC's CPC, a wide-ranging introductory test.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} 

Some U.S. states, though decidedly not the majority, as it is a very recent trend, now mandate or at least strongly encourage certification or a degree from a college- or at the minimum, some evidence of competency beyond the record of on the job training- and/or from either the AAPC or AHIMA, to be employed. Some states have registries of medical coders, though these can be voluntary listings- which is, for those few who do, most often the case- and so not mandatory. This trend was accelerated in part by the passage of [[HIPAA]] (which enforces among other things, patient privacy and access to and the form of medical records) and the [[Affordable Care Act]] (U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s health care reform law); and similar changes in other developed and developing countries, many of which, especially in the Western developed countries, and beyond, use the [[ICD-10]] for diagnostic medical coding, which is a quite complex system of codes. The change to more regulation and training has also been driven by the need to create accurate, detailed, and secure medical records- especially patient charts, bills, and claim form submissions, that can be recorded efficiently in an electronic era of medical records where they need to be carefully shared between different providers or institutions of care, which was encouraged and later required by legislation and institutional policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/federal-requirements-medical-billing-companies-3069.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb-guide.org/medical-billing-laws.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/medical_billing_pros.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/prof_advance.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/medical_billing_schools.htm?pc=&amp;sub=medbilling&amp;qual=associate&amp;ct=either&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Professional associations==
In many countries clinical coders are accommodated for by both professional bodies specific to coding, and organisations who represent the health information management profession as a whole.

IHRIM are the awarding body for the National Clinical Coding Qualification (NCCQ).

===United States===
There are several associations that medical coders in the United States may join, including:
*[[American Health Information Management Association]] (AHIMA)&lt;ref name=ahima&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahima.org/ |title= AHIMA Home - American Health Information Management Association |access-date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[AAPC (healthcare)|AAPC]] (formerly American Academy of Professional Coders)

The AHIMA and AAPC societies' accredited programs will generally train medical coders at a sufficient level to work in their respective states. Some medical coders elect to be certified by both societies.  

AHIMA maintains a list of accredited medical coding certificate (and health information management associate, bachelor's, and graduate programs, through a link on the AHIMA accredited programs page, to [[CAHIIM]]) here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahima.org/careers/codingprograms&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10939">A '''closed system drug transfer device''' or "CSTD" is a drug transfer device that mechanically prohibits the transfer of environmental contaminants into a system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations outside the system. Open versus closed systems are commonly applied in medical devices to maintain the sterility of a fluid pathway. CSTDs work by preventing the uncontrolled inflow and outflow of contaminants and drugs, preserving the quality of solution to be infused into a patient. Theoretically, CSTDs should enable complete protection to healthcare workers in managing hazardous drugs, but possibly due to improper handling or incomplete product design, contaminants can still be detected despite use of CSTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miyake|first=Tomohiro|last2=Iwamoto|first2=Takuya|last3=Tanimura|first3=Manabu|last4=Okuda|first4=Masahiro|date=2013-06-21|title=Impact of closed-system drug transfer device on exposure of environment and healthcare provider to cyclophosphamide in Japanese hospital|journal=SpringerPlus|volume=2|doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-273|issn=2193-1801|pmc=3698436|pmid=23853750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
Hazardous drugs are often used for patients suffering from cancer.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2018 Gurusamy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurusamy|first1=Kurinchi Selvan|last2=Best|first2=Lawrence MJ|last3=Tanguay|first3=Cynthia|last4=Lennan|first4=Elaine|last5=Korva|first5=Mika|last6=Bussières|first6=Jean-François|date=27 March 2018|title=Closed-system drug-transfer devices plus safe handling of hazardous drugs versus safe handling alone for reducing exposure to infusional hazardous drugs in healthcare staff|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012860.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[chemotherapy]] agents are routinely used in the treatment of cancer. However, chemotherapy can be dangerous to a person even if they don't have cancer, as chemotherapy often indiscriminately affects both healthy and cancerous cells.&lt;ref name="ACS Chemo"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Chemotherapy Drugs Work|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/chemotherapy/how-chemotherapy-drugs-work.html|website=www.cancer.org|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the healthcare worker tasked with preparing hazardous medications like chemotherapy, manipulation of these agents presents a substantial risk; for example, it may negatively affect their fertility, increase their risk of developing certain cancers themselves, or have unwelcome effects on fetuses.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2018 Gurusamy" /&gt; As an addition to standard safe handling practices, CSTDs are devices that are designed to additionally limit exposure of hazardous drugs to the personnel that manipulate them.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2018 Gurusamy" /&gt;

==Efficacy==
Investment and interests in CSTDs continue to grow&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/z6wrsj/closed_system?w=5|title=Closed System Drug Transfer Devices - Research and Markets|last=ltd|first=Research and Markets|website=www.researchandmarkets.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the past decade as concerns of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), together with increased awareness of drug risks have pushed the market to explore better options for handling hazardous materials. A [[Cochrane review]] found "no evidence for or against adding CSTD to safe handling of hazardous medicines" based on a review of 23 studies, but acknowledged that the studies did not use randomised controlled trials nor evaluate the value of treatment. CSTDs used in this study include PhaSeal, Tevadaptor and SpikeSwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gurusamy|first=Kurinchi Selvan|title=Closed‐system drug‐transfer devices plus safe handling of hazardous drugs versus safe handling alone for reducing exposure to infusional hazardous drugs in healthcare staff|date=2018-03-27|url=http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012860.pub2/full|work=The Cochrane Library|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd012860.pub2/full|access-date=2018-07-22|last2=Best|first2=Lawrence MJ|last3=Tanguay|first3=Cynthia|last4=Lennan|first4=Elaine|last5=Korva|first5=Mika|last6=Bussières|first6=Jean-François}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains that new solutions to increasing safety of handling hazardous drugs have to be developed. Conceptually, through operating in a closed system, CSTDs should significantly reduce risks to nurses. However, the robustness of product design and extent of proper usage by nurses affects the efficacy of the CSTD in achieving OSH.

==History==
The first [[FDA]]-approved CSTD was in 1998, called PhaSeal. Since that time, many other CSTD products have been developed in the United States.&lt;ref name="Massoomi CSTD Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Massoomi|first1=Fred|title=The Evolution of the CSTD : February 2015 : Oncology Safety - Pharmacy Purchasing &amp; Products Magazine|url=https://www.pppmag.com/article/1638/|website=www.pppmag.com|publisher=Ridgewood Medical Media LLC|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MD Anderson]] hospital was the first hospital in the United States to widely implement CSTD technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parks|first1=Liz|title=Are CSTDs at a Tipping Point in Nation's Hospitals?|work=Pharmacy Practice News|date=March 2014|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of a closed system drug transfer device was first published in an alert warning released by the American [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH). This warning was issued in relation to studies that showed a correlation between working with or near [[hazardous drugs]] in a health care environment and the increased risk of developing skin rashes, infertility, miscarriage and infant birth defects, as well as the possibility of developing leukemia and other forms of cancer. This NIOSH alert recommended that a closed system drug transfer device be used whenever hazardous drugs were to be handled.

===NIOSH===
NIOSH, in response to the need for a working model as to what a "closed system" and what a "closed system drug transfer device" was, provided the following definition:

*A closed system is a device that does not exchange unfiltered air or contaminants with the adjacent environment.&lt;ref name="NIOSH"&gt;{{cite web | author=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] | title=Preventing Occupational Exposure to Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Health Care Settings | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date=September 2004 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-165/2004-165d.html | accessdate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closed system definition originally referred to a [[biological safety cabinet]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bsc/bsc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and not to the drug containment devices. A drug containment device is one that is both airtight and leakproof.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;
*A closed system drug transfer device is a drug transfer device that mechanically prohibits the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations outside the system.&lt;ref name="NIOSH" /&gt;

The NIOSH definition is the only definition that includes drug vapors.&lt;ref&gt;DHHS (NIOSH) Publication Number 2004–165, September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH considers the containment of vapor extremely important, such that in September 2015, NIOSH issued a Testing Protocol to assess the effectiveness of closed systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Regulations.gov|url = http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-0003|website = www.regulations.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH developed and tested 5 CSTDs to assess its "closeness." 2 of the 5 CSTDs tested passed. This protocol is aimed as being a test standard for CSTDs to assess the "closeness" of each system.

===ISOPP===
ISOPP, the [[International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners]], splits the definition of a closed system into two different categories:

*The first defines "closed" in terms of microbiological contamination. This definition deals purely with introducing micro-organisms into a sterile product, and there is no consideration of the sterile product coming out of the vial contaminating the environment.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;ISOPP Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice Volume 13, 2007, pg 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The second category defines "closed" in relation to chemical contamination and refers to drug transfer devices that mechanically prohibit the transfer of environment contaminants into the system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapour concentrations outside the system. ISOPP, however, agree that the NIOSH definition is the most comprehensive and complete.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;

===NIOSH Vapor Containment Protocol Proposal Comment Period Developments===
In September 2015, the CDC issued a proposal for a testing protocol designed to test various CSTDs on the market today to help healthcare decision makers decipher between various systems available on the market today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-0007&lt;/ref&gt; This protocol had an initial close date of November 2015 but was extended until March 2016. Findings from "Fred Massoomi's Response to Docket No. CDC-2015-0075, NIOSH-288" include:
*Testing performed under "Report on NIOSH's Vapor Containment Performance Protocol for CSTDs" showed that Equashield and PhaSeal systems had contamination below the 1ppm recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;CDC Comment CDC-2015-0075-0027 Attachment 2: https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-0027&lt;/ref&gt;
*Testing performed under "5-FU leakage study" showed that Equashield CSTD passed the leakage testing.&lt;ref&gt;CDC Comment CDC-2015-0075-0027 Attachment 3: https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-0027&lt;/ref&gt;
*Testing performed under "Testing of Tevadaptor Efficiency in Preventing Cyclophosphamide" showed that the Tevadaptor system FAILED the contain drug vapor within the system.&lt;ref&gt;CDC Comment CDC-2015-0075-0027 Attachment 1: https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2015-0075-002
&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cochrane Library''' (named after [[Archie Cochrane]]) is a collection of [[database]]s in medicine and other [[health care|healthcare]] specialties provided by [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] and other organizations. At its core is the collection of '''Cochrane Reviews''', a database of [[systematic review]]s and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] which summarize and interpret the results of medical research. The Cochrane Library aims to make the results of well-conducted [[clinical trial|controlled trials]] readily available and is a key resource in [[evidence-based medicine]].

==Access and use==
The Cochrane Library is a subscription-based database, originally published by Update Software and now published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. as part of Wiley Online Library. In many countries, including parts of Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Scandinavian countries, New Zealand, Australia, India, South Africa, and Poland, it has been made available free to all residents by "national provision" (typically a government or Department of Health pays for the license). There are also arrangements for free access in much of Latin America and in "low-income countries", typically via [[HINARI]]. All countries have free access to two-page abstracts of all Cochrane Reviews and to short plain-language summaries of selected articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access options for the Cochrane Library|url=http://www.cochranelibrary.com/help/access-options-for-cochrane-library.html|website=Cochrane Library|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cochrane Reviews appear to be relatively underused in the United States, presumably because public access is limited (the state of [[Wyoming]] is an exception, having paid for a licence to enable free access to Cochrane Reviews for all residents of Wyoming).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grimes DA, Hou MY, Lopez LM, Nanda K |title=Do clinical experts rely on the Cochrane library? |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=111 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=420–2 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18238981 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000300558.51373.ae |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The Cochrane Library consists of the following databases:
* The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews). Contains all the peer-reviewed systematic reviews and protocols prepared by the Cochrane Review Groups.
* The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Contains quality-assessed abstracts of systematic reviews, including a summary of the review and a critical appraisal of its overall quality.
* The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Is a database that contains details of articles of Controlled trials and other studies of healthcare interventions from bibliographic databases (majorly MEDLINE and EMBASE), and other published and unpublished sources that are difficult to access.&lt;ref&gt;Dickersin K, Manheimer E, Wieland S, Robinson KA, Lefebvre C, McDonald S. Development of the Cochrane Collaboration’s Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials. Eval Health Prof. 2002 Mar 1;25(1):38–64.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Cochrane Methodology Register (Methodology Register). Is a bibliography of publications that report on methods used in the conduct of controlled trials.
* Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA). Brings together details of completed and ongoing health technology assessments (studies of the medical, social, ethical and economic implications of healthcare interventions) from around the world.
* NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). This database systematically identifies economic evaluations from around the world, appraises their quality, and highlights their relative strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = The Cochrane Library | title = About The Cochrane Library | url = http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/view/0/AboutTheCochraneLibrary.html | accessdate = 2012-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cochrane Reviews, CENTRAL, Methodology Reviews and Methodology Register are produced by the Cochrane Collaboration. DARE, HTA and NHS EED are compiled and maintained by the [[Centre for Reviews and Dissemination]].

The Cochrane reviews take the format of full-length methodological studies. Cochrane researchers will perform searches of medical databases including [[MEDLINE]], [[PubMed]] and [[EMBASE]]; a continually updated database of trials called the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); hand searching, where researchers look through entire libraries of scientific journals by hand and; reference checking of obtained articles in order to identify studies that are relevant to the question they are attempting to answer. The quality of each study is carefully assessed using predefined criteria and evidence of weak methodology or the possibility that a study may have been affected by bias is reported in the review.

Cochrane researchers then apply [[statistical analysis#Overview|statistical analysis]] to compare the data of the trials. This creates a review of studies, or [[systematic review]], giving a comprehensive view of the efficacy of a particular medical intervention.

===Supplements===
Annual colloquia have been conducted by Cochrane since 1993. From 1994 onwards, Cochrane maintains a database of posters and presentations of past colloquia. From 2009 onwards, Cochrane published the abstracts of those colloquia as supplements to the ''Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews''. From 2010 to 2016, an annual newsletter related to Cochrane methodology called ''Cochrane Methods'' ({{ISSN|2044-4702}}), was published as an annual supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cochrane Supplements |url=http://www.cochranelibrary.com/cochrane-database-of-systematic-reviews/supplements.html |publisher=Cochrane Library |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''complete protein''' or '''whole protein''' is a food source of [[protein]] that contains an adequate proportion of each of the [[essential amino acid|nine essential amino acid]]s necessary in the human [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]].&lt;ref name="medline"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia | title = Protein in diet | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002467.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-28 | date=  September 2, 2003 | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine and National Institute of Health|quote=In the published meta-analysis of nitrogen balance studies by Rand and coworkers (2003), there were no significant differences in the intakes of dietary nitrogen required to meet nitrogen equilibrium between those studies that supplied dietary protein predominantly from animal, vegetable, or mixed protein sources.  It is important to realize, however, that this aggregate analysis does not suggest that dietary protein quality is of no importance in adult protein nutrition.  ... the quality of well-processed soy proteins was equivalent to animal protein ... while wheat proteins were used in significantly lower efficiency ... while lysine is likely to be the most limiting of the indispensable amino acids in diets based predominantly on cereal proteins, the risk of a lysine inadequacy is essentially removed by inclusion of relatively modest amounts of animal or other vegetable proteins, such as those from legumes and oilseeds, or through lysine fortification in cereal flour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of single-source complete proteins are [[red meat]], [[poultry]], fish, eggs, milk, cheese, [[yogurt]], [[soybean]]s and [[quinoa]].&lt;ref name="FNB"&gt;Food and Nutrition Board of [[Institute of Medicine]] (2005) ''Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids'' [https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12#691], page 691, from [[National Academies Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myplate"&gt;{{cite web|title=All About the Protein Foods Group|url=https://www.choosemyplate.gov/protein-foods|publisher=US Department of Agriculture|accessdate=20 May 2018|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="&amp;quot;FAOquinoaancientcrop&amp;quot;"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quinoa: An ancient crop to contribute to world food security|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/aq287e/aq287e.pdf|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|date=July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept does not include whether or not the food source is high in total protein, or any other information about that food's nutritious value.

It was once thought that plant sources of protein are deficient in one or more amino acids, and so [[vegetarian]] diets had to specifically [[Protein combining|combine foods during meals]], which would create a complete protein. However, the most recent position of the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] is that protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melina|first=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|date=2016-12-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31192-3/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1971|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|issn=2212-2672|pmid=27886704|via=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal [[Physiology|physiological]] functioning of the body is possible if one obtains enough protein and sufficient amounts of each amino acid from a plant-based diet.&lt;ref name="VRYoung"&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S-1212S |  id= | pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the highest [[PDCAAS]] scores are not given to commonly eaten meat products, but rather to animal-derived vegetarian foods like [[Cow’s milk|milk]] and eggs and the [[vegan]] food [[soy protein isolate]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38110">'''Comprehensive sex education (CSE)''' is a [[sex education]] instruction method based on-curriculum that aims to give students the knowledge, attitudes, skills and values to make appropriate and healthy choices in their sexual lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] in the future, including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]]. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing teenage and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and [[sexual violence]], thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes [[sexual abstinence]] as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as [[age of consent]], [[safe sex]], [[Birth control|contraception]] such as: [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Rachel|date=January 1, 2017|title=Sex Education: Funding Facts, Not Fear|url=http://p8888-ucelinks.cdlib.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/sfx_local?genre=article&amp;atitle=Sex%20Education%3A%20Funding%20Facts%2C%20Not%20Fear%20%5Bnotes%5D&amp;title=Health%20Matrix:%20Journal%20of%20Law-Medicine&amp;issn=0748383X&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=&amp;date=20170101&amp;aulast=Rubenstein,%20Rachel&amp;spage=525&amp;pages=&amp;sid=EBSCO:HeinOnline:hein.journals.hmax27.19#|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.|volume=27|pages=525–553|via=MasterFILE Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over [[abstinence-only sex education]] is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including condoms, contraception, and refusal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclunc.org/docs/executive_summary_-_2003_statewide_school_district_survey.pdf|title=Sex Education in California Public Schools: Are Students Learning What They Need to Know?|last=Burlingame|first=Julianne|date=August 2003|website=www.aclu.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of CSE ==
Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence-only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|title=Comprehensive Sex Education: Research and Results|date=2010-12-08|website=advocatesforyouth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208154235/http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|archive-date=December 8, 2010|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|title=Comprehensive Sex Education and Academic Success|date=2015-02-26|website=www.futureofsexed.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226100613/http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in "Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as "dirty" and "used." They have also used phrases such as "stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused"  and "chewed-up gum" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], HIV and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2009. ''International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education: An Evidence-informed approach for schools, teachers and health educators''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001832/183281e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of school-based sexuality education programmes has demonstrated increased HIV knowledge, increased self-efficacy related to condom use and refusing sex, increased contraception and condom use, a reduced number of sexual partners and later initiation of first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Fonner et al. 2014. ''School based sex education and HIV prevention in low and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis''. PLoS ONE 9(3): e89692. Doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pone.0089692&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials in Europe, the United States, Nigeria and Mexico also confirmed that CSE prevents unintended adolescent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Oringanje, C. et al. 2009. ''Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents''. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.&lt;ref&gt;Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010. A multi-level model of condom use among male and female upper primary school students in Nyanza, Kenya. Soc Sci Med, Aug 5, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp. 616–25. Epub 2010, May 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; CSE also reduces the frequency of sex and the number of partners which in turn also reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] and the [[African Union]] have recognized CSE’s impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015. ''Empower Young Women and Adolescent Girls: Fast tracking the end of the AIDS epidemic in Africa''. Geneva, UNAIDS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA. 2014a. ''Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A focus on human rights and gender''. New York, UNFPA. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/pub-pdf/UNFPA%20Operational%20Guidance%20for%20 CSE%20-Final%20WEB%20Version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 22 curriculum- based sexuality education programmes found that 80 per cent of programmes that addressed gender or power relations were associated with a significant decrease in pregnancy, childbearing or STIs. These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, N.A. 2015. The case for addressing gender and power in sexuality and HIV education: A comprehensive review of evaluation studies. ''International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health'', Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 31–42. https:// www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4103115.html&lt;/ref&gt; CSE empowers young people to reflect critically on their environment and behaviours, and promotes gender equality and equitable social norms, which are important contributing factors for improving health outcomes, including HIV infection rates. The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2011a.

A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014.

CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self-esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism of CSE ==

=== How comprehensive is CSE ===
While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of "abstinence-plus," due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Ed for Caring Schools Creating an Ethics-Based Curriculum|last=Lamb|first=Sharon|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, "has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== LGBTQIA+ community not included CSE ====
The term "comprehensive" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curvino|first=Melissa and Meghan Grizzle Fischer|date=April 21, 2015|title=Claiming Comprehensive Sex Education is a Right Does Not Make it So|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=e0097ff0-d647-4666-83a3-1229b73b3d13%40sessionmgr120|journal=The New Bioethics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=72–98|via=Taylor and Francis Online|pmid=24979877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as "normal." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erevelles|first=Nirmala|date=2011|title=Coming Out Crip in Inclusive Education|url=|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBTQIA+ students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risky Lessons|last=Fields|first=Jessica|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. 

A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, "high school girls who identified as LGBTQIA+ were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide."&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobel M.D|first=Chanelle et. al|date=August 2017|title=Description of Sexual Orientation and Sexual Behaviors among High School Girls in New York City|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S1083318817300980?via%3Dihub|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=460–465|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|pmid=28279826|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that "the LGBTQIA+ youth accesses health information online five times more than the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, and these rates are even higher for LGBTQIA+ youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. &lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manduley|first=Aida, et al|date=February 8, 2018|title=The role of social media in sex education: Dispatches from queer, trans, and racialized communities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353517717751|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=28|pages=152–170|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0959353517717751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=State Laws and Policies Regarding Sex and HIV Education|last=|first=|date=2018-05-01|website=|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness, in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBTQIA+ people in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a Canada, a federal report showed that LGBTQIA+ community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBTQIA+ population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBTQIA+ community  about topics such  sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‐based projects, and one‐on‐one meetings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lévesque|first=Michel|date=November 29, 2017|title=The Comprehensive Health Education Workers Project and Caring Professionals as Asset‐Builders|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1002/nha3.20200|journal=New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development|volume=29|issue=4|pages=51–55|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/nha3.20200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Who's role is it to deliver sexual education ===
Many people regard health education as a moral or religious issue, and therefore should be taught not in schools.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; "Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent’s responsibility.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, which many people believe is not age appropriate.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Many of those in favor of abstinence only education, usually fear any type of sexual education that encourages sexual behavior at a young age.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Is it necessary ===
Although CSE is seen as the polar opposite of abstinence only education, some critics believe that they are very similar. They both aim at preventing STIs and teen pregnancy. The only way in which they differ is through their primary goal. Abstinence only education aims at reducing premarital sex while comprehensive sex education acknowledges that premarital sex may happen and therefore seeks to reduce the unintended consequences of premarital sex through education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Studies in developing counties surrounding sex education have also shown that comprehensive sex education is not needed. General education, such as literacy skills, was seen to delay sexual initiation and reduced the likelihood of pregnancy. Therefore, some people believe general education is of more importance.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== Federal funding for sexual education ==
Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Patrick and Monica Rodriguez|date=Spring 2011|title=Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/23032415|journal=Human Rights|volume=38|pages=5-22|via=JSTOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) ===
Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements ====
Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the "A-H guidelines," which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; They are as follows:

A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;

C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;&lt;p&gt;D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;&lt;/p&gt;E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;&lt;p&gt;G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and&lt;/p&gt;H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except only when describing failure rates.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) ===
More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP),  which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are "medically accurate and age-appropriate."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if "they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; 

=== California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act ===
In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that "materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners." Additionally, education must now include "instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships," regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

*normalize sexuality as part of human development;
*ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and  instruction; and
*provide pupils with the knowledge and skills to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships.

== CSE as a human right ==
Some critics state that young people’s access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized [[human rights]], which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002431/243106e.pdf|title=Emerging evidence, lessons and practice in comprehensive sexuality education: A global review 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100139-0|location=|pages=14, 15, 25, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) Committee, and the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the [[Commission on Population and Development]] (CPD), which – in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 – called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== CSE in curricula ==

=== CSE teaching methods ===
As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school [[curriculum]]. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners’ critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education – such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement – are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== CSE terminology ===
Apart from the different teaching methods, termiology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word "abstinence" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that "abstinence" connotates is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

The term "comprehensive," is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sex Ed Debates|last=Kendall|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows:&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;should be science-based and medically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Sexual education exemption ===
Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state,  excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Sexual content in the media  ==
Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skull|first=Tracie Marie et. al|date=2014|title=A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health Education|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043483|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–14|via=ERIC|pmid=27081579|pmc=4828968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Teens (ages 13-15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Some studies have found that, "very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme." &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, "At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die." This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary ''[[The Education of Shelby Knox]]'' released in 2005 about [[Lubbock, Texas]], which has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation. The "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

In 2013, ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]]'' was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observed how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|date=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|last=Stein|first=Sadie|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title=About Scarleteen|website=www.scarleteen.com|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator and editor [[Heather Corinna]], historian [[Hanne Blank]], author [[Jessica Valenti]], and [[sex education|comprehensive sex education]] advocate [[Shelby Knox]].

Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has [[social media]].  Platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as [[Person of color|persons of color]]  and LGBTQIA+ persons in hopes to "strengthen sexual health equity for all."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher-led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like [[Sex, Etc.]] and teensource.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teensource.org/content/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=teensource.org|publisher=TeenSource|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive sex education for teenagers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Condom fatigue''' is a term used by medical professionals and [[safer sex]] educators to refer to the phenomenon of decreased condom use. It can also be used to describe a general weariness of and decreased effectiveness of safer sex messages. This is sometimes called "prevention fatigue".

The term has particularly been used to describe [[men who have sex with men]], though the term applies to people of all [[gender]]s and [[sexual orientation]]s.  Condom fatigue has been partially blamed for an increase in [[HIV]] infection rates, though this has not been substantiated in any study.

Condom fatigue is not a universal phenomenon. In Germany, condom use between new sexual partners has increased between 1994 and 2010 from 65% to 87%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bzga.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/hohes-schutzniveau-bei-hiv-aids-schutz-gegen-sexuell-uebertragbare-krankheiten-immer-wichtiger/|title=BZgA : Pressemitteilungen|first=Die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche|last=Aufklärung|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coriaria thymifolia''''', known as '''shanshi''', is a plant found in the northern [[Andes]]. The plant is often mistaken for blueberries,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} however unlike blueberries, the fruit of the Shanshi is toxic and has hallucinogenic properties.&lt;ref name="Golden Guide to Hallucinogenics"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vaults of Erowid|url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/golden_guide/g101-110.shtml|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DISCERN''' is an online instrument designed to measure the quality of [[health information on the Internet]]. It was originally developed by Deborah Charnock, Sasha Shepperd, Gill Needham, and Robert Gann, who reported on its development and validation in a February 1999 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charnock D, Shepperd S, Needham G, Gann R | title = DISCERN: an instrument for judging the quality of written consumer health information on treatment choices | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–11 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 10396471 | pmc = 1756830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DISCERN website was launched in May 1999. Despite originally being developed using printed materials, it has also been shown to be effective at evaluating the quality of online medical information, as well as for printed information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charnock D, Shepperd S | title = Learning to DISCERN online: applying an appraisal tool to health websites in a workshop setting | journal = Health Education Research | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 440–6 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15155597 | doi = 10.1093/her/cyg046 | url = https://academic.oup.com/her/article/19/4/440/560331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rees CE, Ford JE, Sheard CE | title = Evaluating the reliability of DISCERN: a tool for assessing the quality of written patient information on treatment choices | journal = Patient Education and Counseling | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–5 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12088606 | doi = 10.1016/S0738-3991(01)00225-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include [[weight management]] and eating "mainly vegetables, fruit, whole grains and fish, and a reduced intake of red meat, animal fat, and refined sugar."&lt;ref name="Diet11" /&gt;

== Types of diet ==

=== Restrictive diets ===

A number of diets and diet-based regimes are claimed to be useful against cancer. Popular types of "anti-cancer" diet include the [[Breuss diet]], [[Gerson therapy]], the [[Budwig protocol]] and the [[macrobiotic diet]]. None of these diets has been found to be effective, and some of them have been found to be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hübner |first1= J |last2= Marienfeld |first2= S |last3= Abbenhardt |first3= C |last4= Ulrich |first4= CM |last5= Löser |first5= C |displayauthors= 4 |year= 2012 |title= How useful are diets against cancer? |journal= [[Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift]] |volume= 137 |issue= 47 |pages= 2417–22 |doi= 10.1055/s-0032-1327276 |pmid= 23152069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dietary patterns ===

[[nutritional epidemiology|Nutritional epidemiologists]] use [[multivariate statistics]], such as [[principal components analysis]] and [[factor analysis]], to measure how patterns of dietary behavior influence the risk of developing cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Edefonti |first1= V |last2= Randi |first2= G |last3= La Vecchia |first3= C |last4= Ferraroni |first4= M |last5= Decarli |first5= A |displayauthors= 4 |title= Dietary patterns and breast cancer: A review with focus on methodological issues |journal= Nutrition Reviews |volume= 67 |issue= 6 |pages= 297–314 |doi= 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00203.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The most well-studied dietary pattern is the [[mediterranean diet]].) Based on their dietary pattern score, [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] categorize people into [[quantiles]]. To estimate the influence of dietary behavior on risk of cancer, [[scientist|they]] [[Measure (probability)|measure]] the [[Association (statistics)|association]] between quantiles and the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of cancer [[prevalence]] (in [[case-control study|case-control studies]]) and cancer [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (in [[cohort study|longitudinal studies]]). They usually include other [[Variable (research)|variables]] in their [[statistical model]] to account for the other differences between people with and without cancer ([[confounding|confounders]]). For [[breast cancer]], there is a [[Replicate (statistics)|replicated]] trend for [[woman|women]] with a more "prudent or healthy" diet, i.e. higher in [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, to have a lower [[risk]] of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brennan |first1= SF |last2= Cantwell |first2= MM |last3= Cardwell |first3= CR |last4= Velentzis |first4= LS |last5= Woodside |first5= JV |displayauthors= 4 |title= Dietary patterns and breast cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal= [[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] |url= http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/5/1294.long |date= May 2010 |volume= 91 |issue= 5 |pages= 1294–302 |pmid= 20219961 |doi= 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28796}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "drinker dietary pattern" is also associated with higher breast cancer risk, while the association is inconsistent between a more [[Western pattern diet|westernized diet]] and elevated risk of breast cancer. [[Pickled foods]] are linked with cancer.

Assimilated methionine is transformed in [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) which is a key [[metabolite]] for [[polyamine]] synthesis, e.g. [[spermidine]], and [[cysteine]] formation (see the figure on the right). [[Methionine]] breakdown products are also recycled back into [[methionine]] by [[homocysteine]] remethylation and methylthioadenosine (MTA) conversion (see the figure on the right). Vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, [[folic acid]] and [[choline]] are essential cofactors for these reactions.

The products of these reactions are [[methylated]] [[DNA]], [[RNA]] or [[proteins]] and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH has a negative feedback on its own production as an inhibitor of methyltransferase [[enzymes]].

Among these signaling pathways, Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways are involved in the embryonic development, in the biology of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and in the acquisition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).&lt;ref name= "Sarkar2010"/&gt;

[[Image:Stammel 5206.JPG|thumb|300px|''Dipsomania'', an 18th-century woodcarving by Josef Stammel in the library of [[Admont Abbey]].]]
'''Dipsomania''' is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. In the 19th century, the term dipsomania was used to refer to a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as [[alcoholism]]. Dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its historical role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. The word comes from Greek ''dipso'' ({{lang-el|"δίψα"}}= thirst) and ''mania''.

It is still mentioned in the WHO ICD-10 classification as an alternative description for Alcohol Dependence Syndrome, episodic use F10.26

==History==
The term was coined by the German physician [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]] in 1819, when, in a preface to an influential book by German-Russian doctor C. von Brühl-Cramer,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hasso Spode]]: Die Macht der Trunkenheit. Sozial- und Kulturgeschichte des Alkohols, Opladen 1993, pp. 125ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he translated Brühl-Cramer's term "''trunksucht''" as "dipsomania".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119222474/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 The history of alcoholism: Brühl-Cramer's concepts and observations - KIELHORN - 2006 - Addiction - Wiley Online Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the influence of Brühl-Cramer's pioneering work, dipsomania became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/54233 NLA record]&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as "the most medical" of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=dipsomania+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqkL0Nbrrv&amp;sig=aIGzrvkXaWMAsdSyxfWet4Dt4YY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=G3n0SZiYE42clAeJ4sy3DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 Google book search]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with terms such as "inebriety", the idea of dipsomania was used as part of an effort of medical professionals and reformers to change attitudes about habitual drunkenness from being a criminally punishable vice to being a medically treatable disease.&lt;ref name="sagepub 5137"&gt;[http://sls.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/5/1/37 Extract at sagepub.com]&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Roy MacLeod wrote about this dipsomania reform movement, it "illuminates certain features of the gradual transformation taking place in national attitudes towards the prevention and cure of social illnesses during the last quarter of the 19th century."&lt;ref name="sagepub 5137" /&gt;

Although ''dipsomania'' was used in a variety of somewhat contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness.&lt;ref name="psych encyc"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/dipsomania Dipsomania entry] at Psychoanalysis Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1893 book ''Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of Dipsomania'', Magnan characterized dipsomania as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available.&lt;ref name="psych encyc" /&gt; Magnan further described dipsomania as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober.&lt;ref name="psych encyc" /&gt;

Over time, the term dipsomania became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness and alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tracy | first = Sarah | title = Alcoholism in America |pages=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;q=dipsomania | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8018-8119-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donald Hunter'''  [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]] (11 February 1898 &amp;ndash; 11 December 1978) was  a British [[physician]] and author of a classic text on [[occupational medicine]], ''The Diseases of Occupations''.

== Life and works ==
Hunter was born in the [[East End of London]]. His father was George Hunter, a deputy [[engineer]] in the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]]. He entered [[The London Hospital]] in 1915 but left in [[World War I]] to become a [[surgeon]] probationer RNVR in ''HMS Faulkner'' in the [[Dover]] Patrol. After the war, he returned to The London Hospital and qualified in 1920.

Following a series of house appointments, he became first assistant to [[Bertrand Dawson, 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn|Lord Dawson of Penn]] (1864–1945)  and then was appointed Assistant Physician to The London Hospital in 1927. He  completed his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in 1922 and [[Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]] in 1929.

Hunter became [[curator]] to the Medical School Museum in 1933, and during his 30 years in office collected specimens said to ‘represent almost all that is worth having in [[morbid anatomy]]’. He later became Director of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council’]]s Department for Research in Industrial Medicine at The London Hospital.  In 1925 he married Mathilda Bugnion, daughter of a [[Lutheran]] [[Pastor]] from [[Lausanne]], Switzerland. They had four children, two of whom became doctors.

In 1935 he gave a series of lectures to the [[Derby]] Medical Society on [[occupational diseases]]. These lectures were followed by other publications, often jointly with colleagues. These all culminated in his 1955 book ''The Diseases of Occupations'' which became a classic "as soon as it was published". It was said that he wrote all 1000 pages by getting up at 5 a.m. for 18 months. It has been criticized as "perhaps lacking in balance" and being "sometimes irrelevant" but "always entertaining and gaining immeasurably from its readability and its impact on the medical profession."

There followed a [[Penguin Books|Penguin Book]] ''Health in Industry'' published in 1959.  Hunter was founder [[Editor]] of the [[Occupational and Environmental Medicine|British Journal of Industrial Medicine]].

== Memorials==
Hunter's memory is preserved not only by his book but also by a Donald Hunter Room at the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. There is also a Donald Hunter House in London which provides accommodation for students.

'''Forced circumcision''' refers to [[circumcision]] of [[man|males]] who have not given their [[consent]] to the procedure. In a [[Bible|biblical]] context, the term is used especially in relation to [[Paul the Apostle]] and his [[polemic]]s against the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|forced circumcision of gentile Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Dunn, ''Paul and the Mosaic Law'', p. 265; Tomson, "Transformations of Post-70 Judaism," p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Among adults, forced circumcisions have occurred in a wide range of situations, most notably in the [[Forced conversion to Islam|compulsory conversion of non-Muslims to Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;"Although the Qur'an speaks against forced conversion, such conversions of Christians and Jews took place under Muslim rule until the early decades of the twentieth century." Lerner, ''Religion, Secular Beliefs and Human Rights'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; and the forced circumcision of [[Teso people|Teso]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]] and [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] men in [[Kenya]], as well as the abduction of [[South Africa]]n teenage boys to so-called circumcision schools ("bush schools").&lt;ref&gt;On occurrences of forced circumcision in Kenya, see Glazier, ''Land and the Uses of Traditions'', p. 25; Wamwere, ''I Refuse to Die'', p. 149, passim; Karimi and Ochieng, ''The Kenyatta Succession'', p. 13; Rutten and Owuor, "Weapons of mass destruction"; Kagwanja, "Courting genocide." Regarding the situation in South Africa, see Ndangam, ''Lifting the Cloak'', pp. 211-213; Meintjies, ''Manhood at a Price''; Mayatula and Mavundla, "A review on male circumcision procedures"; Crowly and Kesner, "Ritual Circumcision."&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, custom allows uncircumcised [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]-speaking men past the age of circumcision (i.e., 25 years or older) to be overpowered by other men and forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Funani, ''Circumcision among the Ama-Xhosa'', p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and contemporary forced circumcision==

===Hasmonean Kingdom (140 BCE–37 BCE)===
{{see also|Hasmonean Kingdom}}
[[1 Maccabees]] relates the story of how [[Mattathias]] (ca. 166 BC) forcibly circumcised the sons of [[Jews|Jewish]] parents who had abandoned the rite.&lt;ref&gt;"And Mattathias and his friends went around and tore down the altars; they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel " (1 Macc. 2:45-46, New Revised Standard Version).&lt;/ref&gt; Forced circumcision of Gentiles by Jews is attested from the second century BC onwards. In 125 BC [[John Hyrcanus]] conquered [[Edom]], which the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] called Idumea; and the Idumeans were converted to Judaism. As reported by [[Josephus]], circumcision was required of the Idumeans as a token of their acceptance of Judaism:

{{blockquote|Hyrcanus took also Dora and Marissa, cities of Idumea, and subdued all the Idumeans; and permitted them to stay in that country, if they would circumcise their genitals, and make use of the laws of the Jews; and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers, that they submitted to the use of circumcision, and the rest of the Jewish ways of living; at which time therefore this befell them, that they were hereafter no other than Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIII 9:1, 254 ff; see, e.g., Cohen, ''The Beginnings of Jewishness'', pp. 110-111; Taus, ''Torah for Today'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars disagree on the interpretation of the sources. For example, Steven Weitzman believes the Idumeans were forcibly circumcised for political, not religious, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, "Forced Circumcision."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], "[[Ptolemy]]'s claim, that the Idumaeans were compelled to be circumcised and to adopt Jewish ways, is a simplified account of what these urban Idumaeans experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, "Religion, Ethnicity, and Hellenism," p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
During the short reign of Hyrcanus' eldest son, [[Aristobulus I]] (104-103 BC), the [[Hasmonean]]s gained control of [[Galilee]]. In this case, too, sources indicate that the residents were subjected to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Fiensy, ''New Testament Introduction'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests that, during this period, Gentiles fled from Galilee to avoid being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, "Why Evaluate Twenty-five Years," pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
{{see also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
Greeks and Romans regarded circumcision as a mutilation of the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|male genitalia]], but the practice is little discussed in [[Latin literature|Roman literary sources]] until the second century of the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal 14.103–104; [[Tacitus]], ''Historia'' 5.5.1–2; Martial 7.30.5, 7.35.3–4, 7.82.5–6, 11.94; Margaret Williams, "Jews and Jewish Communities in the Roman Empire," in ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 325; Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian'' (Brill, 1976), p. 431; Jack N. Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Religion," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy in Early Christianity]] but this was resolved at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] c.50 which made it clear that circumcision of gentile converts to Christianity was not required.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 15: 5-21&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus (who changed his allegiance from the Jews to the Roman [[Flavians]]) reports that two Roman officers who had taken refuge with Galileans during the war with Rome (early 67 AD) were put under pressure to convert to Judaism. Josephus, declaring that "every one should worship God in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience," claims to have saved the two Gentiles from forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Life'' 23 §113; see also Goodman, "Galilean Judaism," p. 602; Donaldson, ''Paul and the Gentiles'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First Roman-Jewish War]], a head tax, the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], was levied against all Jews. According to [[Suetonius]], [[Domitian]] (c.90) also applied this tax to those who were circumcisied, even if they claimed they were not Jews. [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)]] was put to death in 95 for adopting Jewish customs. In 96 [[Nerva]] relaxed the Jewish tax as applying only to those who professed to be Jews. Sometime between 128 and 132 AD, the emperor [[Hadrian]] seems to have temporarily banned circumcision, on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (Routledge, 1983, 2003), p. 150, and ''Judeophobia: Attitudes toward Jews in the Ancient World'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), p. 103, pointing out this depends on a single note on the ban as a cause for the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', the historical credibility of which is often cast in doubt. [[Cassius Dio]] mentions nothing about circumcision in his account of the revolt. See also Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', pp. 430–431, who thinks the ban makes more sense as a punitive measure after the revolt, since it "ran completely counter to the long established Roman policy of guaranteeing Jewish religious liberty."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoninus Pius]] exempted Jews from the ban,&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews'', p. 150; Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian priests]],&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Origen]] (d. ''ca.'' 253) says that in his time only Jews were permitted to practice circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', p. 103. Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 469, takes Origen as meaning that circumcision was "a solely Jewish rite" by his time.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation under [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the first Christian emperor, freed any slave who was subjected to circumcision; in the year 339, circumcising a slave became punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Greco-Roman writers view circumcision as an identifying characteristic of Jews, they believed the practice to have originated in Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Several Greco-Roman writers, such as [[Strabo]], regarded the Jews as of Egyptian descent, in what was apparently their understanding of [[the Exodus]]: Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded it among peoples they identified as [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arab]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]], [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]], [[Colchis|Colchian]], and [[History of Ethiopia#Classical Antiquity|Ethiopian]]; circumcision was a marker of "the Other".&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 430; Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jews]] might circumcise their male slaves as well as [[Conversion to Judaism|adult male converts]] and Jewish male infants.&lt;ref&gt;Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Judaism," p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Catherine Hezser, it is an open question whether Jews of [[late antiquity]] refrained from forcibly circumcising their Gentile slaves and whether Romans avoided selling their slaves to Jews in reaction to the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, ''Jewish Slavery in Antiquity'', p. 42; see also Hezser, "Slaves and Slavery."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]] (compiled about 200 AD) is silent on this point, whereas the [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael]] (written at the end of the fourth century or later) suggests that Jews might indeed possess uncircumcised slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, ''Jews and Blacks'', p. 378, n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia and North Africa===
Forced conversions, involving forced circumcision, are echoed in a vast body of [[scholarly method|scholarly]] literature spanning the entire history of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lerner, ''Religion, Secular Beliefs, and Human Rights'', p. 142; Ye'or, ''The Decline of Eastern Christianity'', pp. 88-91; Stark, ''God's Battalions'', p. 28; Clarence-Smith, ''Islam'', p. 39, passim; Misra, ''Identity and Religion'', p. 91, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars conclude that, during the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa]], forced conversion to Islam through violence or threat of violence did not play a key role. However, [[tax]]es and regulations requiring the holders of prestigious positions to become Muslims have been regarded as a form of forced conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, ''An Introduction to Islam'', p. 58; see also Misra, ''Identity and Religion'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Asia====
In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Pollilur|1780 Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British soldiers were held imprisoned by [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] and Tipu Sultan in the fortress of [[Srirangapatna|Seringapatnam]]. Of these, more than 300 were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Darby, ''A Surgical Temptation'', pp. 32-33; see also Oddy, ''Religion in South Asia'', p. 42, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell Massey, who kept a secret diary during his captivity, wrote: "I lost with the foreskin of my yard all those benefits of a Christian and Englishman which were and ever shall be my greatest glory."&lt;ref&gt;Colley, ''Captives'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolescence|Adolescent]] captives were, in addition to being circumcised, made to wear female clothes. James Bristow, a teenage [[artillery]]man, revenged himself by circumcising [[dog]]s, believing that this would harm the religious feelings of the Muslim warders. The prospect of punishment did not deter him, because "compelling us to undergo an abhorred operation [was] so base and barbarous an act of aggression, that it was impossible to reflect on it with temper."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, ''Captives of Tipu'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Scurry]], also a prisoner of war, confirms in his book, ''The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry'' (1824), that English soldiers, [[Mangalorean Catholics]], and other prisoners were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref name=Bowring&gt;{{cite book

In 1784, when Tipu returned from [[Mangalore]], he brought back tens of thousands of Mangalorean Catholics from [[Kanara]] and subjected them to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naravane, ''Battles'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hindi idiom 'Mar-mar ke Musalman bana' (meaning 'make Muslim by repeated beating') can be traced to originate from forcible conversion of Hindus.

According to Kativa Daiya, during the 1947 [[partition of India]] "[f]orced circumcision, shaving facial and head hair (for [[Sikh]] men), and shaving off the Hindu [[Brahmin]]'s traditional, short, plaited hair (on an otherwise bald head) were routine Muslim conversion tactics for men and boys."&lt;ref&gt;Daiya, ''Violent Belongings'', pp. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asia News'' reported in 2004 that the Justice and Peace Commission of Lahor spoke out against young non-Muslim men in [[Pakistan]] being converted and circumcised against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Christian-minorities-in-Pakistan:-little-freedom-and-rising-Islamic-pressure-1583.html |title=Christian minorities in Pakistan: little freedom and rising Islamic pressure |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=AsiaNews.it |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the ''Gulf Times'' discussed a case of forced circumcision of [[Nepal]]ese boys in [[Mumbai]] in the context of sex trade in large Indian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Iraq====
[[Iraq]]i [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]], residing almost exclusively in [[Baghdad]] and [[Basra]], do not circumcise.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lupieri, ''The Mandaeans''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their religious sensitivity on this issue has not prevented hostile rulers from subjecting Mandaean men and boys to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''The Great Stem of Souls'', pp. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandaean communities, especially after the invasion of Iraq, have been subject to "murder, kidnapping, rape, forced conversion, forced circumcision and destruction of religious property."&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson et al., "The impact of fear"; see also Nickerson et al., "Fear of Cultural Extinction."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iraq in 2003, shortly after the fall of the Saddam regime, the thirty-five families who made up the Mandean community in Fallujia were ordered at gunpoint to adopt Islam; the men were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabwashingtonian.org/english/article.php?issue=4&amp;articleID=71 |title=The Rape of Basra: Cleansing the Iraqi Mandaeans |author=C.G.

In 2007 the US Committee on International Religious Freedom heard testimony reporting: "Forced conversion is happening in an alarming degree. Boys are being kidnapped, forcibly circumcised - a major sin in the Mandaean religion - and forcibly converted to Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Dr Suhaib Nashi at the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] Hearing on Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity, 25 July 2007; see [http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1268&amp;Itemid=114 USCIRF press release], "USCIRF Hearing: Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity," July 25, 2007 (issued by Judith Ingram).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, after the exodus of the [[Christianity in Iraq|Christians]] from [[Mosul]] and the [[Yazidi|Yazidi's]] from [[Sinjar Mountains|Mount Sinjar]], it was reported that forced circumcisions were taking place conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tunisiadaily.com/2014/08/16/irak-circoncisions-de-chretiens-et-700-femmes-yazidies-vendues-a-150-dollars-piece/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anatolia====

=====The Ottoman Empire=====
There are accounts of Christian boys abducted and forcibly circumcised even in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques, ''The Albanians'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, 9 year old Greek boy Alexandros Kitos and other young boys were kidnapped by Ottoman soldiers and sold into slavery in Egypt, all were circumcised against their will.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek War of Independence the struggle for freedom from Ottoman oppression pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well established that, before and during the [[Armenian Genocide]], forced conversions (involving forced circumcisions) of [[Armenia]]n boys and men were frequent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Bobelian, ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; "In many cases young Armenian children were spared from deportation by local Turks who took them from their families. The children were coerced into denouncing Christianity and becoming Muslims, and were then given new Turkish names. For Armenian boys the forced conversion meant they each had to endure painful circumcision as required by Islamic custom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/armenians.htm |title=Armenians in Turkey 1915-1918 1,5000,000 |year=2000 |publisher=The History Place |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
During the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] in September 1955, "many [[Greece|Greek]] men, including at least one [[priest]], were subjected to forced circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Zayas, "The Istanbul Pogrom"; see also Vryonis, ''The Mechanism of Catastrophe'', pp. 224-226, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the pogrom, the Greek minority eventually emigrated from [[Turkey]]. In 2002 there was a report that non-Muslim army recruits in Turkey had been threatened with forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armenian.ch/gsa/Docs/faae02.pdf |title=Armenians in Turkey Today: A critical assessment of the situation of the Armenian minority in the Turkish Republic |author=Dr Tessa Hofmann |date=October 2002 |publisher= The EU Office of Armenian Associations of Europe|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases are documented where Syro-Orthodox men serving in the Turkish military forces have been threatened with forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Carlier, ''Who Is a Refugee'', pp. 128-129, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a young Christian Turk, fleeing from forced circumcision in the Turkish military forces, was granted [[Asylum in Germany|asylum in]] [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Zabus, ''Between Rites and Rights'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yazidi]] (not all of whom are circumcised) in Turkey have for years been subjected to direct state persecution, including compulsory religious instruction at school, forced conversion, forced circumcision, and mistreatment during military service.&lt;ref&gt;Carlier, ''Who Is a Refugee'', p. 150, n. 203; see also Jwaideh, ''The Kurdish National Movement'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 there was a report of the forced circumcision of Yedizi men in Turkish Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Violence.htm#_ftn5 |title=The nature and uses of violence in the Kurdish conflict |author=Martin van Bruinessen, Utrecht University |date=July 1999 |work=Paper presented at the International colloquium "Ethnic Construction and Political Violence", organized by the Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, Cortona, July 2–3, 1999 |publisher=Universiteit Utrecht |accessdate=3 October 2010 |quote=The Yezidi religious minority has suffered similar but perhaps even more severe forms of oppression than the Christian communities.

====The Arab world====
John Rawlins had sailed for 23 years without incident when, in 1621, he and his crew were kidnapped by pirates from the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa. Rawlins later reported that, after being taken to Algiers, two younger men were "by force and torment ... compelled ... to turn Turks," which means that they were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, "John Rawlins"; see also DiPiero, ''White Men Aren't'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; By organizing a successful [[mutiny]], he was able to return home in 1622.
The Portuguese Friar Jaono dos Sanctos claimed that, annually in Algiers in the 1620s, more than nine hundred Christian slaves were converted to Islam, "besides about fifty boys yearly circumcised against their wills."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Davis, ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====

=====Maluku Islands=====
Thousands of Christians were forcibly circumcised in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] from December 1999 to January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, ''Religious Freedom in Asia'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney Morning Herald reported in detail on this, stating that "almost all" of 3,928 villagers forced to convert to Islam were circumcised.  Razors and knives were reused, causing infections.&lt;ref name="murdoch-smh"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those circumcised, Kostantinus Idi, reported: "I could not escape," he said. "One of them held up my foreskin between pieces of wood while another cut me with a razor ...the third man held my head back, ready to pour water down my throat if I screamed. But I couldn't help but scream and he poured the water. I kept screaming aloud and vomited. I couldn't stand the pain." He further reported that one of the clerics urinated on his wound, saying it would stop infection. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the forced conversions and forced circumcisions had been condemned by moderate Muslim leaders who said they were contrary to Islamic teachings. The local governor had also investigated the incidents.&lt;ref name="murdoch-smh"/&gt;

[[Marco Polo]], in his ''Travels'', relates how a Christian king of [[Ethiopia]] took revenge on the Sultan of Aden, who had forcibly circumcised a [[bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Marco Polo'', Book 3, Chapter 35; see also Strickland, ''Saracens, Demons, &amp; Jews'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
In Kenya, most tribes circumcise. Luo men from Western Kenya are a significant exception, for which reason they have regularly been subjected to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Glazier, ''Land and the Uses of Traditions'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2002, following a violent incident in [[Butere/Mumias District]], a district commissioner instructed the police to "crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/news/thenation08-23-02/|title=Man Forcibly Circumcised As Crowd Watches|last=|first=|date=2002-08-23|website=|publisher=''The Nation'', Nairobi, Kenya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-10-07|quote=&lt;p&gt;A man was yesterday forcibly circumcised by traditional surgeons in Mumias-Butere District as police watched helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr John Otieko... was cornered by a mob ... stripped naked, frog-marched to a nearby river and covered with clay ... then brought to Mayoni trading centre ... to be circumcised as an excited crowd watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts by four traffic police officers who were manning a roadblock on the highway a few metres away from the scene failed when the crowd started stoning them. The victim was then left bleeding at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;District Commissioner Ernest Munyi expressed shock at the incident and told police to crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[Kenyan Human Rights Commission]] announced that it would seek prosecutions against politicians for inciting such violence. In one instance, a cabinet minister had said, "Those who are not circumcised should be taken for a circumcision ceremony." The Commission said this amounted to an incitement to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In late January 2008, a disputed election in which circumcision became an issue between President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu and opposition candidate Raila Odinga, a Luo, "the fact that Odinga was uncircumcised became an issue: He was seen by some Kikuyus as a 'child' unfit to rule because he had not passed through circumcision and initiation." Post-election violence reportedly "focused on tribal animosities", and included several cases of forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In September 2010, at Malaba, West Kenya, a 21-year-old Teso man was lured to a hotel, drugged, smeared with fermented millet flour and was being led away by several Bukusu to be circumcised when the police intervened. The Teso man, who agreed to a medical circumcision, condemned the Bukusu youths for trying to impose their culture on the Teso. Three weeks previously, village neighbours in Aedomoru sub location in Teso north armed themselves with clubs and prevented a 35-year-old man from being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====South Africa====
In 1999, a woman who was feared throughout the Vaal Triangle district of South Africa, controlled a gang of kidnappers that abducted young people, forcibly circumcising the boys and extorting ransoms from their parents for their release. A local police officer said as many as 10 teenagers had been snatched every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In December 2004, 45-year-old Nceba Cekiso was caught and circumcised against his will. The report in the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' noted, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Xhosa culture allows people to forcibly circumcise boys deemed to be past the age of initiation... Forcing people do undergo the ancient ritual ... has, in recent times, caused concern among human rights organisations... (In) one instance two Rastafarians objected to the procedure on religious grounds. The incident has sparked a debate on whether or not traditionalists should still be allowed to force people against their will into the bush to undergo initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite being medically circumcised, a Christian Xhosa was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders in 2007. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. In the settlement that was reached, and which was made an order of the Equality Court, the Congress of Traditional Leaders accepted the right of adult males to choose whether to attend traditional circumcision schools according to their religious beliefs. It apologised for the comments made by its former chairman encouraging the ostracism of teenagers who refused to undergo traditional circumcision. The judge declared, "What is important in terms of the Constitution and law is that no one can be forced to submit to circumcision without his consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Sudan====
There is ample evidence that, for years, Christians of [[Khartoum]] and elsewhere in [[Sudan]] have been forcefully converted to Islam, and that Christian men and boys have been forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3df4bea71c.html "Sudan: Reports of Catholic residents of Khartoum or elsewhere in Sudan being forcefully converted to Islam"], Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 19 October 2001, and references therein; see also Akol, ''Burden of Nationality'', pp. 25-72. According to the ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000'', February 2001 (United States Department of State, Washington, DC), non-Muslim Sudanese boys kidnapped off the streets have undergone forced circumcision in government camps and juvenile houses; see {{cite web

====Uganda====
In 1885, [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Kabaka Mwanga]] ordered the murders of Bishop [[James Hannington]] and many local Christians. During the following period, Islamization led to several Christians being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Otiso, ''Culture and Customs of Uganda'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed by [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Suzette Heald and other scholars, the [[Gisu people|Gisu]] (alternatively, Bagishu) of [[Uganda]] "take pride in not tolerating uncircumcised men." For this reason, in Gisu society, any boy or man who has been able to escape ritual circumcision (called "imbalu") faces the prospect of being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, ''Manhood and Morality'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Voice of America, referring to the same practice, reports: "Among the Bagishu, uncircumcised men are treated with contempt; they are not allowed in society and in most cases they are seen as failing to get local women for marriage. This is supported by all the Bagishu including women who often report uncircumcised men to tribal elders. It's considered traditional that no male is to escape the ritual regardless of where he lives, what he does or what kind of security he has."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Australia===
Traditional circumcision is still practised in some tribal areas of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., DeMello, ''Encyclopedia'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist and anthropologist Peter Sutton, commenting on forced circumcision and the absence of law enforcement in remote settlements, claims that Australian law has been applied in a patchy way: "Involuntary circumcision has long been widely accepted as being de facto outside the scope of Australian law."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, ''The Politics of Suffering'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1996, 34-year-old Irwin Brookdale was drinking with a group of [[Australian Aborigines]] on the banks of a river in far north Queensland. After he passed out, a woman in the group felt down his pants, found that he was not circumcised and called on her companions to "make a man out of him." They attempted to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle. Brookdale ended up in hospital, one of his assailants was convicted of unlawful wounding and Brookdale was awarded A$10,000 compensation for nervous shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Breakup of Yugoslavia====
The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], according to Milica Z. Bookman, "was extremely violent, producing some two million refugees, over 100,000 killed, and evidence of gang rape, impaling, dismemberment and forced circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Bookman, "War and Peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Department of State reported that Muslim and Mujahedin irregular troops  "had routinely performed crude, disfiguring, nonmedical circumcisions on Bosnian Serb soldiers." One 18-year-old Bosnian Serb soldier "was so brutally circumcised that eventually the entire organ required amputation."&lt;ref&gt;''Fourth Report on War Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia: Part II—Torture of Prisoners'', US Department of State Dispatch, vol. 3, no. 52, 28 December 1992, quoted in Kohlmann, ''Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe'', p. 30.

'''Gargling''' (same root as 'gurgle') is the act of bubbling liquid in the [[mouth]]. Vibration caused by the muscles in the throat and back of the mouth cause the liquid to bubble and flurry around inside the mouth cavity.

A traditional home remedy of gargling warm saltwater is sometimes recommended to soothe a sore throat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/features/does-gargling-wlth-salt-water-ease-a-sore-throat#1|title=Does Gargling With Salt Water Ease a Sore Throat?|publisher=WebMD|author=Chris C. Anderson|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in [[Japan]] has shown that gargling water a few times a day will lower the chance of [[upper respiratory infection]]s such as [[common cold|colds]], though some medical authorities are skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Does Gargling With Water Prevent Colds?|url=http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20051020/does-gargling-with-water-prevent-colds|publisher=WebMD|first=Salynn|last=Boyles|date=2005-10-19|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==

Gluten is a [[protein complex]] that accounts for 75–85% of the total protein in bread wheat.&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt;&lt;ref name="cgc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/fact-fait/gluten-eng.htm |title=Gluten's role in bread baking performance |publisher=Canadian Grain Commission |publication-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In home or restaurant cooking, gluten is prepared from [[flour]] by kneading the flour under water, agglomerating the gluten into an elastic network known as a [[dough]], and then washing out the [[starch]].&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt; Starch granules [[suspension (chemistry)|disperse]] in low-temperature water, and the dispersed starch is [[sedimentation|sedimented]] and dried. If a [[salt|saline]] solution is used instead of water, a purer protein is obtained, with certain harmless [[impurity|impurities]] departing the solution with the starch. Where starch is the prime product, cold water is the favored solvent because the impurities depart from the gluten.

In industrial production, a [[slurry]] of wheat flour is kneaded vigorously by machinery until the gluten agglomerates into a mass.&lt;ref name="sakhare"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4252461|year=2013|author1=Sakhare|first1=S. D.|title=Effect of flour particle size on microstructural, rheological and physico-sensory characteristics of bread and south Indian parotta|journal=Journal of Food Science and Technology|volume=51|issue=12|pages=4108–4113|last2=Inamdar|first2=A.

About 65% of the water in the wet gluten is removed by means of a [[screw press]]; the remainder is sprayed through an [[atomizer nozzle]] into a [[drying]] chamber, where it remains at an elevated temperature for a short time to allow the water to evaporate without denaturing the gluten.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The process yields a flour-like powder with a 7% moisture content, which is [[Air cooling|air cooled]] and [[Pneumatics|pneumatically]] transported to a receiving vessel. In the final step, the processed gluten is [[Sieve|sifted]] and [[Mill (grinding)|milled]] to produce a uniform product.&lt;ref name=sakhare/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Wheat field.jpg|thumb|[[Wheat]], a prime source of gluten]]

===Bread products===

Gluten forms when [[glutenin]] molecules cross-link via [[disulfide bond]]s to form a submicroscopic network attached to [[gliadin]], which contributes [[viscosity]] (thickness) and extensibility to the mix.&lt;ref name="shewry1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1692935|year=2002|author1=Shewry|first1=P.

[[Baking]] [[denaturation (biochemistry)|coagulates]] the gluten, which, along with starch, stabilizes the shape of the final product. Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the [[staling]] of bread, possibly because it binds water through hydration.&lt;ref&gt;

The formation of gluten affects the texture of the baked goods.&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt; Gluten's attainable elasticity is proportional to its content of glutenins with low molecular weights, as this portion contains the preponderance of the [[sulfur]] atoms responsible for the cross-linking in the gluten network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Further refining of the gluten leads to chewier doughs such as those found in [[pizza]] and [[bagel]]s, while less refining yields tender baked goods such as [[pastry]] products.&lt;ref name="Baking Technology, Bread"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, [[bread]] flours are high in gluten (hard wheat); pastry flours have a lower gluten content. [[Kneading]] promotes the formation of gluten strands and cross-links, creating baked products that are chewier (as opposed to more brittle or crumbly). The "chewiness" increases as the dough is kneaded for longer times. An increased moisture content in the dough enhances gluten development,&lt;ref name="Baking Technology, Bread"/&gt; and very wet doughs left to rise for a long time require no kneading (see [[no-knead bread]]). [[Shortening]] inhibits formation of cross-links and is used, along with diminished water and less kneading, when a tender and flaky product, such as a [[pie crust]], is desired.

The strength and elasticity of gluten in flour is measured in the baking industry using a [[farinograph]]. This gives the baker a measurement of quality for different varieties of flours when developing recipes for various baked goods.&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/ndsu/simsek/wheat/farinograph.html |title=Farinograph |date=22 September 2014 |website=Wheat Quality and Carbohydrate Research |publisher=North Dakota State University |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliver |first=JR |last2=Allen |first2=HM |date=January 1992 |title=The prediction of bread baking performance using the farinograph and extensograph |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521009800581 |journal=Journal of Cereal Science |publisher=Elsevier |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=79–89 |doi=10.1016/S0733-5210(09)80058-1 |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Added gluten====

Gluten, when dried, milled and added to ordinary [[flour]] dough, may help improve the dough's ability to increase in volume. The resulting mixture also increases the bread's structural stability and chewiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Amendola, J.|author2= Rees, N.|author3= Lundberg, D. E.|year=2002|title=Understanding Baking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gluten-added dough must be worked vigorously to induce it to rise to its full capacity; an automatic [[bread machine]] or [[food processor]] may be required for high-gluten kneading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eckhardt, L.W.|author2=Butts, D.C.|year=1997|title=Rustic European Breads from your Bread Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, higher gluten levels are associated with higher overall protein content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain|title=Against the Grain|date=3 November 2014|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imitation meats===
[[File:Wheat gluten (vegetarian mock duck) 2007.jpg|thumb|Gluten is often used in imitation meats (such as this mock "duck") to provide supplemental protein and variety in vegetarian diets]]
{{details|topic=the use of gluten in cooking|Wheat gluten (food)}}

Gluten, especially [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]], is often the basis for [[Meat analogue|imitation meats]] resembling [[beef]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Duck (food)|duck]] (see [[mock duck]]), [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[pork]]. When cooked in [[broth]], gluten absorbs some of the surrounding liquid (including the flavor) and becomes firm to the bite.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Dorothy, R.; Wingate, Colby. 1993. "Cooking with Gluten and Seitan." Summertown, Tennessee: The Book Publishing Co. 128 p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vegannomnoms.net/2011/03/how-to-make-seitan-an-illustrated-guide.html |title=How to Make Seitan: An Illustrated Guide |last=Abramowski |first=Nicole |date=11 March 2011 |website=Vegan Nom Noms |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of gluten is a popular means of adding supplemental protein and variety to many [[vegetarian]] diets.

===Other consumer products===

Gluten is often present in [[beer]] and [[soy sauce]], and can be used as a [[food additive|stabilizing agent]] in more unexpected food products, such as [[ice cream]] and [[ketchup]]. Foods of this kind may therefore present problems for a small number of consumers because the hidden gluten constitutes a hazard for people with [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]] and gluten sensitivities. The protein content of some [[pet food]]s may also be enhanced by adding gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Gluten is also used in [[cosmetics]], hair products and other [[Dermatology|dermatological]] preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Eur J Dermatol|year=2006|volume=16|issue=1|pages=4–11|title=Gluten intolerance and skin diseases|author1=Humbert P|author2= Pelletier F|author3= Dreno B|author4= Puzenat E|author5= Aubin F|pmid=16436335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celiac disease===
{{Main article|Celiac disease}}

[[Celiac disease]] (CD) is a chronic, multiple-organ [[autoimmune disorder]] primarily affecting the [[small intestine]] caused by the ingestion of wheat, barley, rye, oats, and derivatives, that appears in [[genetic predisposition|genetically predisposed]] people of all ages.

===Wheat allergy===
{{Main article|Wheat allergy}}

People can also experience adverse effects of wheat as result of a [[wheat allergy]].&lt;ref name=ElliBranchi /&gt; As with most allergies, a wheat allergy causes the immune system to abnormally respond to a component of wheat that it treats as a threatening foreign body. This immune response is often time-limited and does not cause lasting harm to body tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cureceliacdisease.org/archives/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-gluten-intolerance-gluten-sensitivity-and-wheat-allergy|publisher=The University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center|title=What’s the difference between celiac disease, gluten intolerance, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy?|date=2015|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheat allergy and celiac disease are different disorders.&lt;ref name=ElliBranchi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/allergyfactsheettwo.pdf |title=Food intolerance and coeliac disease |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=September 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy are similar to those of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. An allergic reaction to wheat has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and could include [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012 /&gt;

===Gluten ataxia===

The ''[[Codex Alimentarius]]'' [[international standard]]s for [[food labeling]] has a standard relating to the labeling of products as "[[gluten-free]]". It only applies to foods that would normally contain gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.org/download/standards/291/cxs_118e.pdf|publisher=[[Codex Alimentarius]]|title=Codex Standard For "Gluten-Free Foods" CODEX STAN 118-1981|date=February 22, 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

By law in Brazil, all food products must display labels clearly indicating whether or not they contain gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |title=General labeling for Packaged Foods (free translation)
  |publisher=[[ANVISA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

The Canadian Celiac Association estimates that one in 133 Canadians experiences adverse symptoms from gluten in celiac disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celiac.ca/?page_id=882|title=About celiac disease|date=2014|publisher=Canadian Celiac Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labels for all food products sold in Canada must clearly identify the presence of gluten if it is present at a level greater than 20 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/allerg/cel-coe/gluten-position-eng.php|title=Health Canada's Position on Gluten-Free Claims|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

In the European Union, all prepackaged foods and non-prepacked foods from a restaurant, take-out food wrapped just before sale, or unpackaged food served in institutions must be identified if gluten-free.&lt;ref name="fsa2016"&gt;{{cite web
  |url= https://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/allergy-guide/labelling-of-gluten-free-foods
  |date=31 October 2016
  | title=Labelling of 'gluten free' foods
  | publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Gluten-free" is defined as 20 parts per million of gluten or less and "very low gluten" is 100 parts per million of gluten or less; only foods with cereal ingredients processed to remove gluten can claim "very low gluten" on labels.&lt;ref name=fsa2016/&gt;

All foods containing gluten as an ingredient must be labelled accordingly as gluten is defined as one of the 14 recognised EU allergens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.food.gov.uk/science/allergy-intolerance/label/labelling-changes|title=EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation (EU FIC) |date=March 2016|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]|format=link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, gluten is not listed on labels unless added as a standalone ingredient. Wheat or other allergens are listed after the ingredient line. The [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has historically classified gluten as "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS). In August 2013, the FDA issued a final ruling, effective August 2014, that defined the term "gluten-free" for voluntary use in the labeling of foods as meaning that the amount of gluten contained in the food is below 20 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Allergens/ucm362880.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|title=Questions and Answers: Gluten-Free Food Labeling Final Rule|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">'''Granny dumping''' (informal) is a term that was introduced in the early 1980s by professionals in the medical and social work fields. Granny dumping is defined by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as "the abandonment of an elderly person in a public place such as a hospital or nursing home, especially by a relative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=granny dumping - definition of granny dumping in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/granny_dumping|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be carried out by family members who are unable or unwilling to continue providing care due to financial problems, burnout, lack of resources (such as home health or assisted living options), or stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dumping Ground For Granny|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/dumping-ground-granny-201140?rm=eu|website=Newsweek|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon is not new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House: Wilson calls for action on ‘granny dumping’ {{!}} The Royal Gazette:Bermuda Health|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150310/NEWS06/150319979|website=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practice, known as ''[[ubasute]]'', had allegedly existed in Japan centuries ago when senile elders were brought to mountaintops by poor citizens who were unable to look after them. The widespread economic and demographic problems facing Japan have seen it on the rise with relatives dropping off seniors at hospitals or charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese people who can't afford elder care are reviving a practice known as 'granny dumping'|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/japanese-people-reviving-granny-dumping-practice-2017-1?r=US&amp;IR=T|website=Business Insider|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70,000 (both male and female equally) elderly Americans were estimated to have been abandoned in 1992 in a report issued by the [[American College of Emergency Physicians]]. In this same study, ACEP received informal surveys from 169 hospital Emergency Departments and report an average of 8 "granny dumping" abandonments per week. According to the New York Times, 1 in 5 people are now caring for an elderly parent and people are spending more time than ever caring for an elderly parent than their own children. Social workers have said that this may be the result of millions of people who are near the breaking point of looking after their elderly parents who are in poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Granny Dumping by the Thousands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/opinion/granny-dumping-by-the-thousands.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=29 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, granny dumping is more likely to happen in states such as Florida, Texas and California where there are large populations of retirement communities. Congress has attempted to step in by mandating to emergency departments requiring them to see all patients. However, Medicaid is covering less and less of medical bills through reimbursement (in 1989 it was 78% but that number is decreasing) and reduced eligibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some cases, the hospitals may not want to take the risk of having a patient who cannot pay so they will attempt to transfer their care to another hospital. According to the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985]] set into place by [[Ronald Reagan]], a hospital can transfer at the patient's request or providers must sign a document providing why they believe a patient's care should be better served at another facility. With 40% of revenue coming from [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] a hospital must earn 8 cents per dollar to compensate for the loss of 7 cents per Medicaid/Medicare patients. Hospitals had to pay an additional 2 billion dollars to private payers to cover costs for Medicare/Medicaid patients in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conard|first=Jane Reister|date=1992|title=Granny Dumping: The Hospital's Duty of Care to Patients Who Have Nowhere to Go|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40239388|journal=Yale Law &amp; Policy Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=463–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of granny dumping can happen before long weekends and may peak before Christmas when families head off on holidays. Caregivers in both Australia and New Zealand report that old people without acute medical problems are dropped off at hospitals. As a result, hospitals and care facilities have to carry an extra burden on their limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Martin|title=Holiday concern about 'granny dumping' at hospitals|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11348685|website=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en-NZ|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disturbing rise in cases of 'granny dumping'|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/elderly-being-dumped-by-families-at-hospital/news-story/4642a4958d8ff9edf5160382350a1103|website=News.com.au|publisher=The Sunday Mail, Queensland|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Hearing loss''', also known as '''hearing impairment''', is a partial or total inability to [[Hearing|hear]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year=2011 | title=Deafness | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | location= | id= | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/154327/deafness | accessdate=2012-02-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625153552/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/154327/deafness | archivedate=2012-06-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''deaf''' person has little to no hearing.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; In children, hearing problems can affect the ability to learn spoken [[language]] and in adults it can create difficulties with social interaction and at work.&lt;ref name=Las2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lasak|first=JM|author2=Allen, P |author3=McVay, T |author4= Lewis, D |title=Hearing loss: diagnosis and management.|journal=Primary Care|date=Mar 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=19–31|pmid=24439878 |doi=10.1016/j.pop.2013.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including: [[genetics]], [[ageing]], [[Noise-induced hearing loss|exposure to noise]], some [[infection]]s, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; A common condition that results in hearing loss is [[chronic ear infections]].&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Certain infections during pregnancy, such as [[syphilis]] and [[rubella]], may also cause hearing loss in the child.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;  Hearing loss is diagnosed when [[hearing testing]] finds that a person is unable to hear 25 [[decibels]] in at least one ear.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns.&lt;ref name=Las2014/&gt; Hearing loss can be categorized as mild (25 to 40 [[decibel|dB]]), moderate (41 to 55 dB), moderate-severe (56 to 70 dB), severe (71 to 90 dB), or profound (greater than 90 dB).&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; There are three main types of hearing loss: [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]], and mixed hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Sm2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=RJH|last2=Shearer|first2=AE|last3=Hildebrand|first3=MS|last4=Van Camp|first4=G|last5=Pagon|first5=RA|last6=Adam|first6=MP|last7=Ardinger|first7=HH|last8=Wallace|first8=SE|last9=Amemiya|first9=A|last10=Bean|first10=LJH|last11=Bird|first11=TD|last12=Fong|first12=CT|last13=Mefford|first13=HC|last14=Smith|first14=RJH|last15=Stephens|first15=K|title=Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview|date=2014|pmid=20301607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
About half of hearing loss globally is preventable through public health measures.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Such practices include [[immunization]], proper care around [[pregnancy]], avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that young people limit the use of [[personal audio player]]s to an hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise.&lt;ref name=WHO2015Aud&gt;{{cite web|title=1.1 billion people at risk of hearing loss WHO highlights serious threat posed by exposure to recreational noise|url=http://www.who.int/pbd/deafness/activities/IECD_2015_Press_Release_EN.pdf?ua=1|website=who.int|accessdate=2 March 2015|date=27 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501204444/http://www.who.int/pbd/deafness/activities/IECD_2015_Press_Release_EN.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=1 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early identification and support are particularly important in children.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; For many [[hearing aids]], [[sign language]], [[cochlear implants]] and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] are useful.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; [[Lip reading]] is another useful skill some develop.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Access to hearing aids, however, is limited in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and culture--&gt;
As of 2013 hearing loss affects about  1.1 billion people to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=22 August 2015|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743–800|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
*Hearing loss exists when there is diminished sensitivity to the sounds normally heard.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt; The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative insensitivity to sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in volume above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.
*Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt; In profound deafness, even the loudest sounds produced by an [[audiometer]] (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.
*[[Speech perception]] – Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech perception. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing loss which affect speech perception alone.

=== Hearing standards ===

{{See also| Absolute threshold of hearing| Hearing range}}

{{further| Equal-loudness contour| A-weighting}}

Human hearing extends in frequency from 20–20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, and in amplitude from 0&amp;nbsp;dB to 130&amp;nbsp;dB or more. 0&amp;nbsp;dB does not represent absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to −5 or even −10&amp;nbsp;dB. 130&amp;nbsp;dB represents the [[threshold of pain]]. But the ear does not hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that can't easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 7029:2000/BS 6951 Acoustics - Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
*difficulty using the [[telephone]]
*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]
*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially of children and women whose voices are of a [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|higher frequency]]. 
*difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])
*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated
*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources

Hearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:
*pain or pressure in the ears
*a blocked feeling

There may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:
*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as "auditory recruitment"
*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present
*[[vertigo]] and disequilibrium
*[[Autophony|tympanophonia]], abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals
*disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke)

==Causes==
Hearing loss has multiple causes, including ageing, genetics, perinatal problems and acquired causes like noise and disease.  For some kinds of hearing loss the cause may be classified as [[idiopathic|of unknown cause]].

===Age===
There is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with aging known as [[presbycusis]]. For men, this can start as early as 25 and women at 30. Although genetically variable it is a normal concomitant of ageing and is distinct from hearing losses caused by noise exposure, toxins or disease agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Robinson| first1=DW| last2=Sutton| first2=GJ| title=Age effect in hearing – a comparative analysis of published threshold data| journal=Audiology| volume=18| issue=4| pages=320–34| year=1979| pmid=475664| doi=10.3109/00206097909072634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are high blood pressure, diabetes or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear.&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, L.,&amp; Hickson, L.

Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning&lt;/ref&gt; While everyone loses hearing with age, the amount and type of hearing loss is variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hearing Loss and Older Adults|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing-loss-older-adults|publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders|accessdate=September 11, 2016|format=Last Updated June 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004200407/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing-loss-older-adults|archivedate=October 4, 2016|df=|date=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise===
{{Main| Noise-induced hearing loss}}
{{globalize| section| date=December 2015}}
Noise exposure is the cause of approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, causing some degree of problems in 5% of the population globally.&lt;ref name=Oishi2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Oishi| first1=N.| last2=Schacht| first2=J.| title=Emerging treatments for noise-induced hearing loss| journal=Expert Opinion on Emerging Drugs| date=June 2011| volume=16| issue=2| pages=235–45| pmid=21247358| doi=10.1517/14728214.2011.552427| pmc=3102156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) recognizes that the majority of hearing loss is not due to age, but due to noise exposure.  By correcting for age in assessing hearing, one tends to overestimate the hearing loss due to noise for some and underestimate it for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2015/03/25/hl-impact-story/| title=CDC - NIOSH Science Blog – A Story of Impact….| work=cdc.gov| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613044654/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2015/03/25/hl-impact-story/| archivedate=2015-06-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss due to noise may be temporary, called a 'temporary threshold shift', a reduced sensitivity to sound over a wide frequency range resulting from exposure to a brief but very loud noise like a gunshot, firecracker, jet engine, jackhammer, etc. or to exposure to loud sound over a few hours such as during a pop concert or nightclub session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/noise/health_effects/effects.html|title=Noise and Hearing Conservation: Effects of Excessive Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration|publisher=|access-date=July 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629163619/https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/noise/health_effects/effects.html|archivedate=June 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery of hearing is usually within 24 hours, but may take up to a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/handbook/Threshold_Shift.html|title=Threshold Shift (TS)|website=Simon Fraser University|access-date=2016-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503122331/http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/handbook/Threshold_Shift.html|archivedate=2016-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both constant exposure to loud sounds (85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or above) and one-time exposure to extremely loud sounds (120&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or above) may cause permanent hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/noise/signs.htm|title=About Hearing Loss|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720230923/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/noise/signs.htm|archivedate=2016-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) typically manifests as elevated hearing thresholds (i.e. less sensitivity or muting) between 3000 and 6000&amp;nbsp; Hz, centred at 4000&amp;nbsp; Hz. As noise damage progresses, damage spreads to affect lower and higher frequencies. On an [[audiogram]], the resulting configuration has a distinctive notch, called a 'noise' notch. As ageing and other effects contribute to higher frequency loss (6–8&amp;nbsp;kHz on an audiogram), this notch may be obscured and entirely disappear.

Various governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]], and numerous state government agencies among others, set noise standards.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has identified the level of 70&amp;nbsp;dB(A) (40% louder to twice as loud as normal conversation; typical level of TV, radio, stereo; city street noise) for 24‑hour exposure as the level necessary to protect the public from hearing loss and other disruptive effects from noise, such as sleep disturbance, stress-related problems, learning detriment, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety. Document ID: usepa-1974&lt;/ref&gt; Noise levels are typically in the 65 to 75&amp;nbsp;dB (A) range for those living near airports of freeways and may result in hearing damage if sufficient time is spent outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanda.org.za/index.php/resources-links/deafness|title=Deafness|last=|first=|website=SANDRA: South African National Deaf Association|access-date=2016-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801152215/http://www.sanda.org.za/index.php/resources-links/deafness|archivedate=2016-08-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louder sounds cause damage in a shorter period of time. Estimation of a "safe" duration of exposure is possible using an ''exchange rate'' of 3&amp;nbsp;dB. As 3&amp;nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the "safe" daily exposure amount at 85&amp;nbsp;dB A, known as an [[exposure action value]], is 8 hours, while the "safe" exposure at 91&amp;nbsp;dB(A) is only 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Noise Exposure, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 98-126&lt;/ref&gt; 
Different standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85&amp;nbsp;dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a ''synergistic'' interaction.  Since noise damage is cumulative over long periods of time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.

Some national and international organizations and agencies use an exchange rate of 4&amp;nbsp;dB or 5&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B – GLOSSARY OF TERMS| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112204458/http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| archivedate=2013-11-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these exchange rates may indicate a wider zone of comfort or safety, they can significantly underestimate the damage caused by loud noise. For example, at 100&amp;nbsp;dB (nightclub music level), a 3&amp;nbsp;dB exchange rate would limit exposure to 15 minutes; the 5&amp;nbsp;dB exchange rate allows an hour.

Many people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85&amp;nbsp;dB A or greater), then hearing loss will occur. Sound intensity (sound energy, or propensity to cause damage to the ears) increases dramatically with proximity according to an inverse square law: halving the distance to the sound quadruples the sound intensity.

In the USA, 12.5% of children aged 6–19 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.&lt;ref name="kid"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth| work=CDC Healthy Youth!| publisher=CDC| date=2009-07-01| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221020243/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| archivedate=2009-12-21| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using [[personal audio devices]] that are too loud.&lt;ref name=WHO2015Aud/&gt;

Hearing loss due to noise has been described as primarily a condition of modern society.&lt;ref name=Go2007&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Goines| first1=Lisa| last2=Hagler| first2=Louis| title=Noise Pollution: A Modern Plague| journal=Southern Medical Journal| date=March 2007| volume=100| issue=3| pages=287–294| url=http://www.nonoise.org/library/smj/smj.htm| accessdate=26 November 2014| doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3180318be5| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829155656/http://www.nonoise.org/library/smj/smj.htm| archivedate=29 August 2017| df=| citeseerx=10.1.1.504.8717}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preindustrial times, humans had far less exposure to loud sounds. Studies of primitive peoples indicate that much of what has been attributed to age-related hearing loss may be long term cumulative damage from all sources, especially noise. People living in preindustrial societies have considerably less hearing loss than similar populations living in modern society.  Among primitive people who have migrated into modern society, hearing loss is proportional to the number of years spent in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Rosen| first1=S| title=Presbycusis study of a relatively noise-free population in the Sudan| journal= Ann.

===Genetic===
Hearing loss can be inherited. Around 75–80% of all these cases are inherited by [[recessive genes]], 20–25% are inherited by [[dominant genes]], 1–2% are inherited by [[X-linked]] patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by [[mitochondrial inheritance]].&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web| last=Rehm| first=Heidi| title=The Genetics of Deafness; A Guide for Patients and Families| url=http://hearing.harvard.edu/info/GeneticDeafnessBookletV2.pdf| work=Harvard Medical School Center For Hereditary Deafness| publisher=Harvard Medical School| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019153702/http://hearing.harvard.edu/info/GeneticDeafnessBookletV2.pdf| archivedate=2013-10-19| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the genetics of deafness, there are 2 different forms, syndromic and [[Nonsyndromic deafness|nonsyndromic]]. Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual. This accounts for around 30% of deaf individuals who are deaf from a genetic standpoint.&lt;ref name=Harvard /&gt; Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with an individual other than deafness. From a genetic standpoint, this accounts for the other 70% of cases, and represents the majority of hereditary hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Harvard /&gt; Syndromic cases occur with diseases such as [[Usher syndrome]], [[Stickler syndrome]], [[Waardenburg syndrome]], [[Alport's syndrome]], and [[neurofibromatosis type 2]]. These are diseases that have deafness as one of the symptoms or as a common feature associated with it. Many of the genetic mutations giving rise to syndromic deafness have been identified. In nonsyndromic cases, where deafness is the only finding, it is more difficult to identify the genetic mutation although some have been discovered.

* Gene mapping has identified the genetic locations for several nonsyndromic dominant (DFNA#) and recessive (DFNB#) forms of deafness. The first gene mapped for non-syndromic deafness, DFNA1, involves a splice site mutation in the formin related homolog diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1). A single base change in a large [[Costa Rica]]n family was identified as causative in a rare form of low frequency onset progressive hearing loss with autosomal dominant inheritance exhibiting variable age of onset and complete penetrance by age 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Lynch| first1=Eric D.| last2=Lee| first2=Ming K.| last3=Morrow| first3=Jan E.| last4=Welcsh| first4=Piri L.| last5=León| first5=Pedro E.| last6=King| first6=Mary-Claire| title=Nonsyndromic deafness DFNA1 associated with mutation of a human homolog of the Drosophila gene diaphanous| journal=Science| volume=278| issue=5341| pages=1315–18| date=1997-11-14| pmid=9360932| doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of congenital hearing loss in developed countries is DFNB1, also known as connexin 26 deafness or [[GJB2]]-related deafness.
* The most common dominant syndromic forms of hearing loss include [[Stickler syndrome]] and [[Waardenburg syndrome]].
* The most common recessive syndromic forms of hearing loss are [[Pendred syndrome]] and [[Usher syndrome]].
* The congenital defect [[microtia]], deformed or unformed outer ear, can be associated with partial or complete conductive deafness, depending upon the severity of the deformity and whether the middle ear is also affected. It can also be associated with abnormalities of the inner ear giving rise to an additional sensorineural component to the hearing loss (mixed deafness). 
*Dozens of additional genes for nonsyndromic deafness have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;hereditaryhearingloss.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perinatal problems===
* [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]]s are reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mothers, from the ototoxic effect on the developing fetus plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess [[ethanol|alcohol]] intake.
* [[Premature birth]] can be associated with sensorineural hearing loss because of an increased risk of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[hyperbilirubinaemia]], ototoxic medication and infection as well as noise exposure in the neonatal units. The risk of hearing loss is greatest for those weighing less than 1500&amp;nbsp;g at birth.

===Disorders===
*[[Stroke|strokes]] – Depending on what blood vessels are affected by the stroke, one of the symptoms can be deafness &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKee|first=Michael M.|last2=Stransky|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Reichard|first3=Amanda|date=2018-1|title=Hearing loss and associated medical conditions among individuals 65 years and older|journal=Disability and Health Journal|volume=11|issue=1|pages=122–125|doi=10.1016/j.dhjo.2017.05.007|issn=1876-7583|pmid=28596096}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[multiple sclerosis]] can have an effect on hearing as well. Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is an [[autoimmune disease]] where the immune system attacks the [[myelin sheath]], a covering that protects the nerves. If the auditory nerve becomes damaged, the affected person will become completely deaf in one or both ears. There is no cure for MS.
*[[perilymph fistula]] – a microtear in either the round or oval window (membranes separating the middle and inner ear) of the cochlea causing perilymph to leak into the middle ear. This usually occurs as a consequence of trauma, including barotrauma, and can give rise to vertigo as well as hearing loss.
*viral – viral infections of the ear can cause sensorineural hearing loss usually as the consequence of a labyrinthitis. The patient may be generally unwell at the time.  
** [[Measles]] may cause [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|auditory nerve]] damage but usually gives rise to a chronic middle ear problem giving rise to a mixed hearing loss.
** [[Mumps]] (Epidemic parotitis) may result in profound sensorineural hearing loss (90&amp;nbsp;dB or more), unilateral (one ear) or bilateral (both ears).

**[[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]] variant 1E (CMT1E) is noted for demyelinating in addition to deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKusick|first1=Victor A.|last2=Kniffen|first2=Cassandra L.|title=# 118300 CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE AND DEAFNESS|url=http://omim.org/entry/118300|website=Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man|accessdate=2 March 2018|date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Autoimmune disease]] is recognized as a cause for cochlear damage. Although rare, it is possible for autoimmune processes to target the cochlea specifically as a first presentation. [[Granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] is one of the autoimmune conditions that may precipitate hearing loss. [[Cogan's syndrome]] commonly presents with hearing loss. 
* [[Otosclerosis]] is a condition that can cause fixation of the stapes (or stirrup) in the middle ear preventing its movement and causing a conductive hearing loss. 
* [[Vestibular schwannoma]], erroneously known as [[Acoustic neuroma]]s, and other types of [[brain tumor]]s can cause hearing loss by infringement of the tumor on the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]]
*Congenital problems
** [[Superior semicircular canal dehiscence]], a gap in the bone cover above the inner ear, can lead to low-frequency conductive hearing loss, autophony and vertigo.
*recurring ear infections or concomitant secondary infections (such as bacterial infection subsequent to viral infection) can result in hearing loss

===Medications===
Some medications may reversibly affect hearing. These medications are considered [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic]]. This includes [[loop diuretic]]s such as furosemide and bumetanide, [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) both over-the-counter (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) as well as prescription (celecoxib, diclofenac, etc.), paracetamol, [[quinine]], and [[macrolide antibiotics]]. The link between NSAIDs and hearing loss tends to be greater in women, especially those who take ibuprofen six or more times a week.&lt;ref name="Analgesic"&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/176/6/544.abstract?sid=750067d3-6651-49ac-b40b-82ee5a3fc27b/| title=Analgesic Use and the Risk of Hearing Loss in Women| journal=American Journal of Epidemiology| volume=176| issue=6| pages=544–554| first1=Sharon G.| last1=Curhan| first2=Josef| last2=Shargorodsky| first3=Roland| last3=Eavey| first4=Gary C.| last4=Curhan| date=2012-02-29| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214195730/http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/176/6/544.abstract?sid=750067d3-6651-49ac-b40b-82ee5a3fc27b%2F| archivedate=2015-12-14| df=| doi=10.1093/aje/kws146| pmid=22933387| pmc=3530351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others may cause permanent hearing loss.&lt;ref name="asha"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Ototoxic-Medications/| title=Ototoxic Medications (Medication Effects)| first1=Barbara| last1=Cone| first2=Patricia| last2=Dorn| first3=Dawn| last3=Konrad-Martin| first4=Jennifer| last4=Lister| first5=Candice| last5=Ortiz| first6=Kim| last6=Schairer| publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association| accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important group is the [[aminoglycoside]]s (main member [[gentamicin]]) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as [[cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybak|first=Leonard P.|last2=Mukherjea|first2=Debashree|last3=Jajoo|first3=Sarvesh|last4=Ramkumar|first4=Vickram|date=November 2009|title=Cisplatin ototoxicity and protection: clinical and experimental studies |journal=The Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine|volume=219|issue=3|pages=177–186|pmc=2927105|pmid=19851045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybak|first=L.

On October 18, 2007, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced that a warning about possible sudden hearing loss would be added to drug labels of [[PDE5 inhibitor]]s, which are used for erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref name="FDA-PDE5"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm| title=FDA Announces Revisions to Labels for Cialis, Levitra and Viagra| date=2007-10-18| publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]| accessdate=2011-10-30| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023051639/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm| archivedate=2011-10-23| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiologic monitoring for ototoxicity allows for the (1) early detection of changes to hearing status presumably attributed to a drug/treatment regime so that changes in the drug regimen may be considered, and (2) audiologic intervention when handicapping hearing impairment has occurred.[https://audiology.org/publications-resources/document-library/ototoxicity-monitoring]

===Chemicals===
{{Main| Ototoxicity}}
In addition to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific chemicals in the environment: metals, such as [[lead]]; [[solvents]], such as [[toluene]] (found in [[crude oil]], [[gasoline]]&lt;ref name="tol-nih"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=30| title=Tox Town – Toluene – Toxic chemicals and environmental health risks where you live and work – Text Version| publisher=toxtown.nlm.nih.gov| accessdate=2010-06-09| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609052911/http://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=30| archivedate=2010-06-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[automobile exhaust]],&lt;ref name="tol-nih" /&gt; for example); and [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]]s.&lt;ref name="def9"&gt;{{cite news| title=Addressing the Risk for Hearing Loss from Industrial Chemicals| first=Thais C.| last=Morata| work=| url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/pubs/presentations/AOHC.swf| publisher=CDC| accessdate=2008-06-05| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122171205/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/pubs/presentations/AOHC.swf| archivedate=2009-01-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with noise, these [[ototoxic]] chemicals have an additive effect on a person’s hearing loss.&lt;ref name="def9" /&gt;

Hearing loss due to chemicals starts in the high frequency range and is irreversible.

===Physical trauma===
There can be damage either to the ear itself or to the brain centers that process the aural information conveyed by the ears. People who sustain head injury are especially vulnerable to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oesterle|first1=EC|title=Changes in the adult vertebrate auditory sensory epithelium after trauma.|journal=Hearing Research|date=March 2013|volume=297|pages=91–8|pmid=23178236|pmc=3637947|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2012.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggermont|first1=JJ|title=Acquired hearing loss and brain plasticity.|journal=Hearing Research|volume=343|pages=176–190|date=24 May 2016|pmid=27233916|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2016.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Sound waves reach the outer ear and are conducted down the ear canal to the [[eardrum]], causing it to vibrate. The vibrations are transferred by the 3 tiny ear bones of the [[middle ear]] to the fluid in the inner ear. The fluid moves hair cells ([[stereocilia]]), and their movement generates nerve impulses which are then taken to the brain by the [[cochlear nerve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Hear|url=https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/how-we-hear/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Hear|url=https://www.sc.edu/ehs/training/Noise/hearing.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501041002/http://www.sc.edu/ehs/training/Noise/hearing.htm|archivedate=1 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The auditory nerve takes the impulses to the brainstem, which sends the impulses to the midbrain. Finally, the signal goes to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe to be interpreted as sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Do We Hear?|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/how-do-we-hear|publisher=NIDCD|language=en|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss is most commonly caused by long-term exposure to loud noises, from recreation or from work, that damage the hair cells, which do not grow back on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Noise-Induced Hearing Loss?|url=https://www.noisyplanet.nidcd.nih.gov/parents/what-is-noise-induced-hearing-loss|publisher=NIH - Noisy Planet|language=en|date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Preventing Hearing Loss, Risk Factors - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/preventhearingloss/riskfactors.html|publisher=NIOSH/CDC|accessdate=3 March 2018|language=en-us|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older people may lose their hearing from long exposure to noise, changes in the inner ear, changes in the middle ear, or from changes along the nerves from the ear to the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age-Related Hearing Loss|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss|publisher=NIDCD|language=en|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{anchor|Quantification_of_hearing_loss}}
[[File:HearingExam.jpg|thumb|An [[audiologist]] conducting an [[audiometry|audiometric]] [[hearing test]] in a [[sound-proof]] testing booth|alt=a female medical professional is seated in front of a special [[sound-proof]] booth with a glass window, controlling diagnostic test equipment. Inside the booth a middle aged man can be seen wearing headphones and is looking straight ahead of himself, not at the [[audiologist]], and appears to be concentrating on hearing something]]

Identification of a hearing loss is usually conducted by a general practitioner [[medical doctor]], [[otolaryngologist]], certified and licensed [[audiologist]], school or industrial [[audiometrist]], or other audiometric technician. Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or [[otorhinolaryngologist]].

===Case history===
A case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ. Case history will include such items as:
*major concern
*birth and pregnancy information
*medical history
*development history
*family history
*workplace environment
*home environment

===Examination===
*[[otoscopy]], visual examination of the outer ear, ear canal, eardrum, and middle ear (through the translucent eardrum) using an optical instrument inserted into the ear canal called an otoscope 
*[[tympanometry]]
*differential testing – the [[Weber test|Weber]], [[Rinne test|Rinne]], [[Bing test|Bing]] and [[Schwabach test|Schwabach]] tests are simple manual tests of auditory function conducted with a low frequency (usually 512&amp;nbsp;Hz) tuning fork that can provide a quick indication of type of hearing loss: unilateral/bilateral, conductive, or other

===Laboratory testing===
In case of infection or inflammation, blood or other body fluids may be submitted for laboratory analysis.

===Hearing tests===
{{See also|Audiometry|Pure tone audiometry|Auditory brainstem response|Otoacoustic emissions}}
Hearing loss is generally measured by playing generated or recorded sounds, and determining whether the person can hear them. Hearing sensitivity varies according to the [[frequency]] of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an [[audiogram]].

Another method for quantifying hearing loss is a speech-in-noise test. As the name implies, a speech-in-noise test gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. A person with a hearing loss will often be less able to understand speech, especially in noisy conditions. This is especially true for people who have a sensorineural loss – which is by far the most common type of hearing loss. As such, speech-in-noise tests can provide valuable information about a person's hearing ability, and can be used to detect the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss. A recently developed digit-triple speech-in-noise test may be a more efficient screening test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jansen, et.al.|first1=S|title=Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test.|journal=Ear Hear|date=2013|volume=34|issue=6|pages=773–8|doi=10.1097/AUD.0b013e318297920b|pmid=23782715|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/398543/2/Jansen_Ear%26Hearing_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. The test is also useful in older children and adults and is an important measure in diagnosing auditory neuropathy described above.

Auditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem. This test can be used to identify delay in the conduction of neural impulses due to tumours or inflammation but can also be an objective test of hearing thresholds. Other electrophysiological tests, such as cortical evoked responses, can look at the hearing pathway up to the level of the auditory cortex.

===Scans===
MRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss. They are only needed in selected cases.

===Classification===
Hearing loss is categorized by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.

====Severity====
The severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in [[decibel]]s of hearing loss, or dB HL. The measurement of hearing loss in an individual is conducted over several [[frequency|frequencies]], mostly 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz and 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The hearing loss of the individual is the average of the hearing loss values over the different frequencies. Hearing loss can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries different systems are in use.

Hearing loss may be ranked as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* Slight: between 16 and 25&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Mild:
** for adults: between 26 and 40&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** for children: between 20 and 40&amp;nbsp;dB HL&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Moderate: between 41 and 54&amp;nbsp;dB HL&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Moderately severe: between 55 and 70&amp;nbsp;dB HL&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Severe: between 71 and 90&amp;nbsp;dB HL&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Profound: 91&amp;nbsp;dB HL or greater&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Totally deaf: Have no hearing at all.  This is called ''anacusis''.

The 'Audiometric Classifications of Hearing Impairment' according to the International Bureau Audiophonology (BIAP) in Belgium is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIAP Recommendation 02/1 bis - AUDIOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING IMPAIRMENTS|url=https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|website=biap.org|publisher=International Bureau Audiophonology|accessdate=18 June 2017|date=26 October 1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010426/https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Normal or subnormal hearing: average tone loss is equal or below 20&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Mild hearing loss: average tone loss between 21 and 40&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Moderate hearing loss
** First degree: average tone loss between 41 and 55&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** Second degree: average tone loss between 56 and 70&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Severe hearing loss
** First degree: average tone loss between 71 and 80&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** Second degree: average tone loss between 81 and 90&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Very severe hearing loss
** First degree: average tone loss between 91 and 100&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** Second degree: average tone loss between 101 and 110&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** Third degree: average tone loss between 111 and 119&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Total hearing loss or Cophosis: average tone loss is equal or more than 120&amp;nbsp;dB HL

Hearing loss may affect one or both ears. If both ears are affected, then one ear may be more affected than the other.  Thus it is possible, for example, to have normal hearing in one ear and none at all in the other, or to have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate hearing loss in the other.

For certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing loss is described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing loss can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a legally recognized formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized "percentage of hearing loss", which is suitable for legal purposes only.

====Type====
There are four main types of hearing loss, [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]], [[central deafness]] and combinations of conductive and sensorineural hearing losses which is called mixed hearing loss.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt; An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is [[auditory processing disorder]] which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.

*Conductive hearing loss
Conductive hearing loss is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The eardrum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] after ear infections may also make the eardrum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.

Dysfunction of the three small bones of the [[middle ear]] – malleus, incus, and stapes – may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the [[ossicles]] may be impaired for different reasons including a boney disorder of the ossicles called [[otosclerosis]] and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or [[ankylosis]] may also cause hearing loss.

*Sensorineural hearing loss
Sensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea or the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing loss is damage to the [[hair cells]] in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.&lt;ref name="RussellPineYoung2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Russell JL, Pine HS, Young DL |title=Pediatric cochlear implantation: expanding applications and outcomes. |journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=841–863 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2013.04.008 |pmid=23905823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Central deafness
Damage to the brain can lead to a central deafness. The peripheral ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to process speech information.

*Mixed hearing loss
Mixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective [[ear drum]] or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.  In addition to the conductive loss, a sensory component may be present.

*Central [[auditory processing disorder]]

This is not an actual hearing loss but gives rise to significant difficulties in hearing. One kind of auditory processing disorder is [[King-Kopetzky syndrome]], which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. An [[auditory processing disorder]]s is sometimes linked to language disorders in persons of all ages.

====Configuration====
The shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a [[Carhart notch]] for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a [[schwannoma]] or other tumor.
There are four general configurations of hearing loss:

1. Flat: thresholds essentially equal across test frequencies.

2. Sloping: lower (better) thresholds in low-frequency regions and higher (poorer) thresholds in high-frequency regions.

3. Rising: higher (poorer) thresholds in low-frequency regions and lower (better) thresholds in higher-frequency regions.

4. Trough-shaped ("cookie-bite" or "U" shaped): greatest hearing loss in the mid-frequency range, with lower (better) thresholds in low- and high-frequency regions.

====Unilateral and bilateral====
People with [[unilateral hearing loss]] or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:

*hearing conversation on their impaired side
*localizing sound
*understanding speech in the presence of background noise.

In quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.

One reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the [[head shadow effect]]. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu JE. Speech-language and educational consequences of unilateral hearing loss in children.

===Workplace noise regulation===
Noise is widely recognized as an [[occupational hazard]]. In the United States, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) work together to provide standards and enforcement on workplace noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/|title=Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709222707/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/|archivedate=July 9, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/standards.html|title=Safety and Health Topics: Occupational Noise Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506050548/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/standards.html|archivedate=May 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hierarchy of hazard control]]s demonstrates the different levels of controls to reduce or eliminate exposure to noise and prevent hearing loss, including [[engineering controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol/#The%2520Hierarchy%2520of%2520Control|title=Controls for Noise Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704113757/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol/#The%2520Hierarchy%2520of%2520Control|archivedate=July 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs and initiative have been created to prevent hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the [[Safe-In-Sound Award|Safe-in-Sound Award]] was created to recognize organizations that can demonstrate results of successful noise control and other interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe-in-Sound|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527193835/http://www.safeinsound.us/|archivedate=May 27, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Buy Quiet]] program was created to encourage employers to purchase quieter machinery and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=Buy Quiet|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808151558/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|archivedate=August 8, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By purchasing less noisy power tools like those found on the [[NIOSH Power Tools Database]] and limiting exposure to ototoxic chemicals, great strides can be made in preventing hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-sound-vibration/|title=PowerTools Database|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630135841/http://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-sound-vibration/|archivedate=June 30, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies can also provide personal hearing protector devices tailored to both the worker and type of employment. Some hearing protectors universally block out all noise, and some allow for certain noises to be heard. Workers are more likely to wear hearing protector devices when they are properly fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-136/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Occupationally-Induced Hearing Loss (2010-136)|work=cdc.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512031928/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-136/|archivedate=2016-05-12|df=|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2010136|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often interventions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss have many components. A 2017 Cochrane review found that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume = 7|pages = CD006396|last=Tikka|first=Christina|last2=Verbeek|first2=Jos H|last3=Kateman|first3=Erik|last4=Morata|first4=Thais C|last5=Dreschler|first5=Wouter A|last6=Ferrite|first6=Silvia|date=2017-07-07|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd006396.pub4|pmid = 28685503|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Providing workers with information on their noise exposure levels was not shown to decrease exposure to noise. Ear protection, if used correctly, can reduce noise to safer levels, but often, providing them is not sufficient to prevent hearing loss. Engineering noise out and other solutions such as proper maintenance of equipment can lead to noise reduction, but further field studies on resulting noise exposures following such interventions are needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective. The conclusion of the Cochrane Review was that further research could modify what is now regarding the effectiveness of the evaluated interventions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Screening===
The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends screening for all newborns.&lt;ref name=Las2014/&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] advises that children should have their hearing tested several times throughout their schooling:&lt;ref name="kid" /&gt;
*When they enter [[preschool|school]]
*At ages 6, 8, and 10
*At least once during [[middle school]]
*At least once during [[High school (North America)|high school]]
While the American College of Physicians indicated that there is not enough evidence to determine the utility of screening in adults over 50 years old who do not have any symptoms,&lt;ref name="annals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1309706 | title=Screening for Hearing Loss in Older Adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | publisher=The American College of Physicians | work=Annals of Internal Medicine | first=Virginia A. | last=Moyer | date=2012-11-06 | volume=157 | issue=9 | pages=655–661 | accessdate=2012-11-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027083232/http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1309706 | archivedate=2012-10-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association|American Language, Speech Pathology and Hearing Association]] recommends that adults should be screened at least every decade through age 50 and at 3-year intervals thereafter, to minimize the detrimental effects of the untreated condition on quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Who-Should-be-Screened/|title=Who Should be Screened for Hearing Loss|website=www.asha.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, the US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion included as one of [[Healthy People program|Healthy People 2020]] objectives: to increase the proportion of persons who have had a hearing examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/hearing-and-other-sensory-or-communication-disorders/objectives|title=Hearing and Other Sensory or Communication Disorders {{!}} Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318002053/https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/hearing-and-other-sensory-or-communication-disorders/objectives|archivedate=2017-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

Treatment depends on the specific cause if known as well as the extent, type and configuration of the hearing loss. Most hearing loss, that resulting from age and noise, is progressive and irreversible, and there are currently no approved or recommended treatments; management is by hearing aid. A few specific kinds of hearing loss are amenable to surgical treatment.  In other cases, treatment is addressed to underlying pathologies, but any hearing loss incurred may be  permanent.

There are a number of devices that can improve hearing in those who are deaf or hard of hearing or allow people with these conditions to manage better in their lives.

===Hearing aids===
[[Hearing aid]]s are devices that work to improve the hearing and speech comprehension of those with hearing loss.&lt;ref name="NIDCD"&gt;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(NIDCD)(2013).

Conversely, there are many people who choose not to wear their hearing aids for a multitude of reasons. Up to 40% of adults with hearing aids for hearing loss fail to use them, or do not use them to their full effect.&lt;ref name=Bark2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Fiona|last2=Mackenzie|first2=Emma|last3=Elliott|first3=Lynette|last4=Jones|first4=Simon|last5=de Lusignan|first5=Simon|date=2016-08-18|title=Interventions to improve hearing aid use in adult auditory rehabilitation|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD010342/ENT_interventions-improve-hearing-aid-use-adult-auditory-rehabilitation|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD010342|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010342.pub3|pmid=27537242|issn=1465-1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of reasons for this, stemming from factors such as: the aid amplifying background noises instead of the sounds they intended to hear; issues with comfort, care, or maintenance of the device; aesthetic factors; financial factors; and personal preference for quietness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.evidentlycochrane.net/learning-love-hearing-aids/|title=Learning to love our hearing aids.

There is little evidence that interventions to encourage the regular use of hearing aids, (e.g. improving the information given to people about how to use hearing aids), increase daily hours of hearing aid use, and there is currently no agreed set of outcome measures for assessing this type of intervention.&lt;ref name=Bark2016/&gt;

===Assistive devices===
Many deaf and hard of hearing individuals use assistive devices in their daily lives:
* Individuals can communicate by telephone using [[Teleprinter|telephone typewriters]] (TTY). Other common names are textphone, minicom and telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD). These devices look like typewriters or word processors and transmit typed text over regular telephone lines. This allows communication through visual messaging. TTYs can transmit messages to individuals who don’t have TTY by using the National Relay service which is an operator that acts as a messenger to each caller.&lt;ref name="Working With Hearing Loss"&gt;Working with Hearing Loss. (2008). Retrieved October 31, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.chha.ca/documents/Working_With_Hearing_Loss.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113030625/http://www.chha.ca/documents/Working_With_Hearing_Loss.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[mobile phones]], software apps are available to provide TDD/textphone functionality on some carriers/models to provide 2-way communications.
* There are several new [[telecommunications relay service]] technologies including [[IP Relay]] and [[captioned telephone]] technologies. A deaf or hard of hearing person can communicate over the phone with a hearing person via a human translator. Phone captioning is a service in which a hearing person's speech is captioned by a third party, enabling a deaf or hard of hearing person to conduct a conversation with a hearing person over the phone.&lt;ref name="phcapt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phonecaption.com/ | title=Free Phone Caption Service for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; | publisher=Phone Caption | accessdate=2010-12-10 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202061809/http://www.phonecaption.com/ | archivedate=2010-02-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wireless]], [[Internet]] and [[mobile phone]]/[[short message service|SMS]] [[text messaging]] are beginning to take over the role of the TDD. 
* [[Real-time text]] technologies, involving streaming text that is continuously transmitted as it is typed or otherwise composed. This allows conversational use of text. Software programs are now available that automatically generate a closed-captioning of conversations. Examples include discussions in conference rooms, teleconference calls, classroom lectures, and/or religious services.&lt;ref name="Interact-AS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.auditorysciences.com/ | title=Auditory Sciences | publisher=Auditory Sciences | accessdate= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513105437/http://auditorysciences.com/ | archivedate=2013-05-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[Instant messaging]] software. 
* [[Videophone]]s and similar video technologies can be used for distance communication using sign language. [[Video conferencing]] technologies permit signed conversations as well as permitting a [[Sign language#Telecommunications facilitated signing|sign language]]–English interpreter to voice and sign conversations between a deaf or hard of hearing person and that person's hearing party, negating the use of a [[teletypewriter|TTY device]] or [[computer keyboard]].
* [[Video relay service]] and [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI) services also use a third-party telecommunication service to allow a deaf or hard-of-hearing person to communicate quickly and conveniently with a hearing person, through a sign language interpreter.
* [[Hearing dog]]s are a specific type of [[assistance dog]] specifically selected and trained to assist the deaf and hard of hearing by alerting their handler to important sounds, such as [[doorbell]]s, [[smoke alarm]]s, ringing [[telephone]]s, or [[alarm clock]]s.
* The advent of the Internet's [[World Wide Web]] and [[closed captioning]] has given the deaf and hard of hearing unprecedented access to information. Electronic mail and online chat have reduced the need for deaf and hard-of-hearing people to use a third-party Telecommunications Relay Service to communicate with the hearing and other deaf people.
* A person with hearing loss cannot always hear the phone or distinguish their own ringtone from another. A signaling transmitter can be attached to a phone that will cause a light or a vibration device to activate. Transmitters can also be used to activate visual cues to represent fire alarms.&lt;ref name="Working With Hearing Loss" /&gt;
* Individuals with hearing loss require phones with [[amplifier]]s that have a higher power of amplification when compared to a regular phone. The Hearing Aid Telephone Interconnect System is a hands free amplification system which allows people to amplify sound when using telephones, cell phones, computer and pay phones by way of the attachment of a portable unit.&lt;ref name="Working With Hearing Loss" /&gt;

===Wireless hearing aids===
A wireless device has two main components: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter broadcasts the captured sound, and the receiver detects the broadcast audio and enables the incoming audio stream to be connected to accommodations such as hearing aids or captioning systems.

Three types of wireless systems are commonly used: [[Frequency modulation|FM]], [[audio induction loop]], and InfraRed. Each system has advantages and benefits for particular uses. FM systems can be battery operated or plugged into an electrical outlet. FM system produce an analog audio signal, meaning they have extremely high fidelity. Many FM systems are very small in size, allowing them to be used in mobile situations. The audio induction loop permits the listener with hearing loss to be free of wearing a receiver provided that the listener has a hearing aid or cochlear implant processor with an accessory called a "[[telecoil]]". If the listener does not have a telecoil, then he or she must carry a receiver with an earpiece. As with FM systems, the [[infrared]] (IR) system also requires a receiver to be worn or carried by the listener. An advantage of IR wireless systems is that people in adjoining rooms cannot listen in on conversations, making it useful for situations where privacy and confidentiality are required. Another way to achieve confidentiality is to use a hardwired amplifier, which contains or is connected to a microphone and transmits no signal beyond the earpiece plugged directly into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyers|first1=Carol, Dr.|title=Infrared, Frequency/Digital Modulation, and Induction Hearing Loops : A comparison of assisted listening system technologies|url=http://tfwm.com/infrared-frequencydigital-modulation-and-induction-loops/|website=Technology for Worship|publisher=INSPIRATION Technology Conferences, Inc.|accessdate=30 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204103117/http://tfwm.com/infrared-frequencydigital-modulation-and-induction-loops/|archivedate=4 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical===
[[File:Cochlear implant.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a [[cochlear implant]]]]
There is no treatment, surgical or otherwise, for hearing loss due to the most common causes (age, noise, and genetic defects).  For a few specific conditions, surgical intervention can provide a remedy:
 
*surgical correction of [[superior canal dehiscence]]
*[[myringotomy]], surgical insertion of drainage ventilation tubes in the tympanic membrane.  Such placement is usually temporary until the underlying pathology (infection or other inflammation) can be resolved.
*radiotherapy or surgical excision of [[vestibular schwannoma]] or acoustic neuroma, though, in most cases, it is unlikely that hearing will be preserved
*[[Stapedectomy]] and [[stapedotomy]] for otosclerosis - replacement or reshaping of the stapes bone of the middle ear can restore hearing in cases of conductive hearing loss

Surgical and implantable hearing aids are an alternative to conventional external hearing aids. 
If the ear is dry and not infected, an air conduction aid could be tried; if the ear is draining, a direct bone condition hearing aid is often the best solution. If the conductive part of the hearing loss is more than 30–35 [[Decibel|dB]], an air conduction device could have problems overcoming this gap. A [[bone-anchored hearing aid]] could, in this situation, be a good option.
The active bone conduction hearing implant Bonebridge is also an option. This implant is invisible under the intact skin and therefore minimises the risk of skin irritations.&lt;ref name="pmid25142577"/&gt;

[[Cochlear implants]] improve outcomes in people with hearing loss in either one or both ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cochlear Implantation in Adults A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal=JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | year=2013 | doi=10.1001/jamaoto.2013.1744 | pmid=23429927 | volume=139 | issue=3 | pages=265–72 | author=Gaylor James M., Raman Gowri, Chung Mei, Lee Jounghee, Rao Madhumathi, Lau Joseph, Poe Dennis S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They work by artificial stimulation of the [[cochlear nerve]] by providing an electric impulse substitution for the firing of hair cells. They are expensive, and require programming along with extensive training for effectiveness.

Cochlear implants as well as bone conduction implants can help with single sided deafness.
Middle ear implants or bone conduction implants can help with conductive hearing loss.&lt;ref name="pmid25142577"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Riss D, Arnoldner C, Baumgartner WD, Blineder M, Flak S, Bachner A, Gstoettner W, Hamzavi JS |title=Indication criteria and outcomes with the Bonebridge transcutaneous bone-conduction implant.|journal=Laryngoscope|volume= 124| issue = 12|pages=2802–2806|year=2014|pmid=25142577|doi=10.1002/lary.24832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with cochlear implants are at a higher risk for bacterial [[meningitis]]. Thus, meningitis vaccination is recommended.&lt;ref name="fda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/cochlear.html | title=FDA Public Health Notification: Risk of Bacterial Meningitis in Children with Cochlear Implants | publisher=FDA | date=2002-07-24 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925005206/http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/cochlear.html | archivedate=2008-09-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have hearing loss, especially those who develop a hearing problem in childhood or old age, may need support and technical adaptations as part of the rehabilitation process. Recent research shows variations in efficacy but some studies&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cochlearimplant.net/page5/page5.html | title=Elliot &amp; Oliver's Story – Research | publisher=cochlearimplant.net | year=2006 | accessdate= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302225726/http://www.cochlearimplant.net/page5/page5.html | archivedate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that if implanted at a very young age, some profoundly impaired children can acquire effective hearing and speech, particularly if supported by appropriate rehabilitation.

===Classroom===
For a classroom setting, children with hearing loss often benefit from direct instruction and communication. One option for students is to attend a school for the Deaf, where they will have access to the language, communication, and education. Another option is to have the child attend a mainstream program, with special accommodation such as providing favorable seating for the child. Having the student sit as close to the teacher as possible improves the student's ability to hear the teacher's voice and to more easily read the teacher's lips. When lecturing, teachers can help the student by facing them and by limiting unnecessary noise in the classroom. In particular, the teacher can avoid talking when their back is turned to the classroom, such as while writing on a whiteboard.

Some other approaches for classroom accommodations include pairing deaf or hard of hearing students with hearing students. This allows the deaf or hard of hearing student to ask the hearing student questions about concepts that they have not understood. The use of CART (Communication Access Real Time) systems, where an individual types a captioning of what the teacher is saying, is also beneficial.&lt;ref name="CART Systems"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://deafness.about.com/cs/cart/a/cart.htm | title=CART Systems | publisher= | accessdate= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011910/http://deafness.about.com/cs/cart/a/cart.htm | archivedate=2014-04-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The student views this captioning on their computer. Automated captioning systems are also becoming a popular option.&lt;ref name="Interact-AS"/&gt; In an automated system, software, instead of a person, is used to generate the captioning. Unlike CART systems, automated systems generally do not require an Internet connection and thus they can be used anywhere and anytime. Another advantage of automated systems over CART is that they are much lower in cost. However, automated systems are generally designed to only transcribe what the teacher is saying and to not transcribe what other students say. An automated system works best for situations where just the teacher is speaking, whereas a CART system will be preferred for situations where there is a lot of classroom discussion.

For those students who are completely deaf, one of the most common interventions is having the child communicate with others through an interpreter using sign language.&lt;ref name="GuideFacts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/wp/access/hearing.html | title=An Educators Guide to Hearing Disability Issues.

Globally, hearing loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree.&lt;ref name=Oishi2011/&gt; It caused moderate to severe disability in 124.2&amp;nbsp;million people as of 2004 (107.9&amp;nbsp;million of whom are in low and middle income countries).&lt;ref name=WHO2008/&gt; Of these 65&amp;nbsp;million acquired the condition during childhood.&lt;ref name="Peads2011"/&gt; At birth ~3 per 1000 in [[developed countries]] and more than 6 per 1000 in [[developing countries]] have hearing problems.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;

Hearing loss increases with age. In those between 20 and 35 rates of hearing loss are 3% while in those 44 to 55 it is 11% and in those 65 to 85 it is 43%.&lt;ref name=Las2014/&gt;

A 2017 report by the World Health Organization estimated the costs of unaddressed hearing loss and the cost-effectiveness of interventions, for the health-care sector, for the education sector and as broad societal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global costs of unaddressed hearing loss and cost-effectiveness of interventions: a WHO report|last=World Health Organization|first=WHO|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2017|isbn=978-92-4-151204-6|location=Geneva|pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Globally, the annual cost of unaddressed hearing loss was estimated to be in the range of $750–790 billion [[International Dollars|international dollars]].

===United States===
Data from the United States in 2011-2012 found that rates of hearing loss has declined among adults aged 20 to 69 years, when compared with the results from an earlier time period (1999-2004). It also found that adult hearing loss is associated with increasing age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, and noise exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Howard J.|last2=Dobie|first2=Robert A.|last3=Losonczy|first3=Katalin G.|last4=Themann|first4=Christa L.|last5=Flamme|first5=Gregory A.|title=Declining Prevalence of Hearing Loss in US Adults Aged 20 to 69 Years|journal=JAMA Otolaryngology–Head &amp; Neck Surgery|language=en|doi=10.1001/jamaoto.2016.3527|pmid=27978564|pmc=5576493|volume=143|issue=3|pages=274–285|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly one in four adults had audiometric results suggesting noise-induced hearing loss. Almost one in four adults who reported excellent or good hearing had a similar pattern (5.5% on both sides and 18% on one side). Among people who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one third had such changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Yulia I|last2=Eichwald|first2=John|last3=Scinicariello|first3=Franco|last4=Hoffman|first4=Howard J.|last5=Deitchman|first5=Scott|last6=Radke|first6=Marilyn S.|last7=Themann|first7=Christa L.|last8=Breysse|first8=Patrick|date=2017-01-01|title=Vital Signs: Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Among Adults — United States 2011–2012|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6605e3.htm|journal=MMWR.

==History==
{{see also|History of deaf education in the United States}}
Abbé [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] opened the first school for the deaf in Paris at the [[Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris|deaf school]]. The American [[Thomas Gallaudet]] witnessed a demonstration of deaf teaching skills from Épée's successor [[Abbé Sicard]] and two of the school's deaf faculty members, [[Laurent Clerc]] and [[Jean Massieu]]; accompanied by Clerc, he returned to the United States, where in 1817 they founded [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut. [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) started to evolve from primarily [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), and other outside influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frishberg | first=Nancy | title=Arbitrariness and Iconicity: Historical Change in American Sign Language | journal=Language |date=September 1975 | volume=51 | issue=3 | pages=696–719 | doi=10.2307/412894| jstor=412894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After language acquisition===
{{Main|Post-lingual deafness}}
''Post-lingual deafness'' is hearing loss that is sustained after the [[language acquisition|acquisition of language]], which can occur due to [[disease]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or as a side-effect of a medicine. Typically, hearing loss is gradual and often detected by family and friends of affected individuals long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Carly|last2=Scarinci|first2=Nerina|last3=Ryan|first3=Brooke|last4=Hickson|first4=Louise|date=2015-12-01|title="This Is a Partnership Between All of Us": Audiologists' Perceptions of Family Member Involvement in Hearing Rehabilitation|url=https://aja.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=2466851|journal=American Journal of Audiology|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=536–548|doi=10.1044/2015_AJA-15-0026|pmid=26649683|issn=1059-0889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-lingual deafness is far more common than pre-lingual deafness. Those who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges, living with the adaptations that allow them to live independently.

===Before language acquisition===
{{Main|Prelingual deafness}}
''Prelingual deafness'' is hearing loss that is sustained before the [[language acquisition|acquisition of language]], which can occur due to a [[congenital]] condition or through hearing loss in early infancy. It is believed that prelingual deafness impairs an individual's ability to acquire a ''spoken'' language, but some deaf children can acquire spoken language through speech immersion along with support from sign language and hearing aids or cochlear implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Kathryn|last2=Lillo-Martin|first2=Diane|last3=Chen Pichler|first3=Deborah|date=2014-04-01|title=Spoken English Language Development Among Native Signing Children With Cochlear Implants|url=https://academic.oup.com/jdsde/article/19/2/238/377174|journal=The Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=238–250|doi=10.1093/deafed/ent045|pmid=24150489|issn=1081-4159|pmc=3952677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-signing parents of deaf babies usually go with oral approach without the support of sign language because prelingual hearing loss is acquired via either disease or trauma rather than genetically inherited, so families with deaf children nearly always lack previous experience with [[sign language]]. Unfortunately, this brings on the risk of language deprivation for the deaf baby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wyatte C.|date=2017-05-01|title=What You Don't Know Can Hurt You: The Risk of Language Deprivation by Impairing Sign Language Development in Deaf Children|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=21|issue=5|pages=961–965|doi=10.1007/s10995-017-2287-y|pmid=28185206|pmc=5392137|issn=1092-7875}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the deaf baby wouldn't have a language if the child is unable to acquire spoken language successfully. Deaf babies born into signing families rarely have delays in language development since they do meet language milestones, but in sign language in lieu of spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|date=2007|title=When timing is everything: Age of first-language acquisition effects on second-language learning|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|volume=28|issue=3|pages=537–549|doi=10.1017/s0142716407070294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of treatments===
There has been considerable controversy within the culturally deaf community over [[cochlear implant]]s. For the most part, there is little objection to those who lost their hearing later in life, or culturally deaf adults choosing to be fitted with a cochlear implant.&lt;ref name=Spa2005/&gt;

Many in the deaf community strongly object to a deaf child being fitted with a cochlear implant (often on the advice of an audiologist); new parents may not have sufficient information on raising deaf children and placed in an oral-only program that emphasizes the ability to speak and listen over other forms of communication such as [[sign language]] or [[total communication]]. Many Deaf people view cochlear implants and other hearing devices as confusing to one's identity. A Deaf person will never be a hearing person and therefore would be trying to fit into a way of living that is not their own. Other concerns include loss of [[Deaf culture]] and identity and limitations on hearing restoration.&lt;ref name=Spa2005/&gt;

Jack Gannon, a professor at [[Gallaudet University]], said this about [[Deaf culture]]: "Deaf culture is a set of learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences." Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, "[deaf people] tend to congregate around the kitchen table rather than the living room sofa… our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet for the first time we tend to exchange detailed biographies."&lt;ref&gt;Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America by Jack Gannon (National Association of the Deaf, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the "pathological view of the deaf."&lt;ref name=pathological&gt;{{cite web|title=American Deaf Culture|url=http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|work=Sign Media, Incorporated|publisher=Sign Media, Inc|accessdate=14 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522030209/http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|archivedate=22 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers. Bill Vicars expresses the power of this bond when stating, "if given the chance to become hearing most [deaf people] would choose to remain deaf."&lt;ref name="deafcultureonline"&gt;{{cite web | last=Drolsbaugh | first=Mark | title=Everything You've Wanted to Know About Deaf Culture (And Then Some) | url=http://www.deaf-culture-online.com/ | publisher=Deaf Culture Online | accessdate=2011-11-28 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213211737/http://www.deaf-culture-online.com/ | archivedate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States-based [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] has a statement on its website regarding cochlear implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NAD Cochlear Implant Committee|title=NAD Position Statement on Cochlear Implants (2000)|url=http://nad.org/issues/technology/assistive-listening/cochlear-implants|website=Cochlear Implants %7c National Association of the Deaf|publisher=National Association of the Deaf|accessdate=30 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205174005/http://nad.org/issues/technology/assistive-listening/cochlear-implants|archivedate=5 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NAD asserts that the choice to implant is up to the individual (or the parents), yet strongly advocates a fully informed decision in all aspects of a cochlear implant. Much of the negative reaction to cochlear implants stems from the medical viewpoint that deafness is a condition that needs to be "cured," while the Deaf community instead regards deafness a defining cultural characteristic.

Many other assistive devices are more acceptable to the Deaf community, including but not limited to, hearing aids, [[closed captioning]], email and the Internet, text telephones, and video relay services.

===Sign language===
{{Main|Sign language}}
Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. "Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Sign Language|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|website=NIDCD|accessdate=17 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115163913/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|archivedate=15 November 2016|df=|date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who are deaf (by either state or federal standards) have access to a free and appropriate public education. If a child does qualify as being deaf or hard of hearing and receives an individualized education plan, the [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] team must consider, "the child's language and communication needs. The IEP must include opportunities for direct communication with peers and professionals. It must also include the student’s academic level, and finally must include the students full range of needs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/hq9806.html |title=Deaf Students Education Services |accessdate=2016-01-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116005121/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/hq9806.html |archivedate=2016-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithDD2010"&gt;Smith, D. D., &amp; Tyler, N. C. (2010). Introduction to Special Education. Columbus: Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part, the Department of Education defines deafness as "… a hearing impairment that is so severe that the child is impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, with or without amplification …." Hearing impairment is defined as "… an impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness …."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulations: Part 300 / A / 300.8 / c|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2C300%2CA%2C300%252E8%2Cc%2C|website=U.

====Inclusion versus pullout====
{{globalize|date=November 2014}}
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell and his Scott Circle School.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Graham Bell]] with teachers and students of the Scott Circle School for deaf children, Washington, D.C., 1883]]

In a residential school where all the children use the same communication system (whether it is a school using ASL, Total Communication or Oralism), students will be able to interact normally with other students, without having to worry about being criticized. An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.&lt;ref name="SmithDD2010" /&gt;

====Family====
The communication limitations between people who are deaf and their hearing family members can often cause difficulties in family relationships, and affect the strength of relationships among individual family members. It was found that most people who are deaf have hearing parents, which means that the channel that the child and parents communicate through can be very different, often affecting their relationship in a negative way. If a parent communicates best verbally, and their child communicates best using sign language, this could result in ineffective communication between parents and children. Ineffective communication can potentially lead to fights caused by misunderstanding, less willingness to talk about life events and issues, and an overall weaker relationship. Even if individuals in the family made an effort to learn deaf communication techniques such as sign language, a deaf family member often will feel excluded from casual banter; such as the exchange of daily events and news at the dinner table. It is often difficult for people who are deaf to follow these conversations due to the fast-paced and overlapping nature of these exchanges. This can cause a deaf individual to become frustrated and take part in less family conversations. This can potentially result in weaker relationships between the hearing individual and their immediate family members. This communication barrier can have a particularly negative effect on relationships with extended family members as well. Communication between a deaf individual and their extended family members can be very difficult due to the gap in verbal and non-verbal communication. This can cause the individuals to feel frustrated and unwilling to put effort into communicating effectively. The lack of effort put into communicating can result in anger, miscommunication, and unwillingness to build a strong relationship.&lt;ref name="FOSTER"&gt;Foster, S. (1996). Communication experiences of deaf people: An ethnographic account. In I. Parasnis (Ed.), Cultural and language diversity of the deaf experience (pp. 117-136). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community====
People who have hearing loss can often experience many difficulties as a result of communication barriers among them and other hearing individuals in the community. Some major areas that can be impacted by this are involvement in extracurricular activities and social relationships. For young people, extracurricular activities are vehicles for physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development. However, it is often the case that communication barriers between people who are deaf and their hearing peers and coaches/club advisors limit them from getting involved. These communication barriers make it difficult for someone with a hearing loss to understand directions, take advice, collaborate, and form bonding relationships with other team or club members. As a result, extracurricular activities such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteering are often not as enjoyable and beneficial for individuals who have hearing loss, and they may engage in them less often. A lack of community involvement through extracurricular activities may also limit the individual’s social network. In general, it can be difficult for someone who is deaf to develop and maintain friendships with their hearing peers due to the communication gap that they experience. They can often miss the jokes, informal banter, and "messing around" that is associated with the formation of many friendships among young people. Conversations between people who are deaf and their hearing peers can often be limited and short due to their differences in communication methods and lack of knowledge on how to overcome these differences. Deaf individuals can often experience rejection by hearing peers who are not willing to make an effort to find their way around communication difficulties. Patience and motivation to overcome such communication barriers is required by both the deaf or hard of hearing and hearing individuals in order to establish and maintain good friendships.&lt;ref name="FOSTER" /&gt;

Many people tend to forget about the difficulties that deaf children encounter, as they view the deaf child differently from a deaf adult. Deaf children grow up being unable to fully communicate with their parents, siblings and other family members. Examples include being unable to tell their family what they have learned, what they did, asking for help, or even simply being unable to interact in daily conversation. Deaf children have to learn sign language and to read lips at a young age, however they cannot communicate with others using it unless the others are educated in sign language as well. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing are faced with many complications while growing up, for example some children have to wear hearing aids and others require assistance from sign language (ASL) interpreters. The interpreters help them to communicate with other individuals until they develop the skills they need to efficiently communicate on their own. Although growing up for deaf children may entitle more difficulties than for other children, there are many support groups that allow deaf children to interact with other children. This is where they develop friendships. There are also classes for young children to learn sign language in an environment that has other children in their same situation and around their same age. These groups and classes can be very beneficial in providing the child with the proper knowledge and not to mention the societal interactions that they need in order to live a healthy, young, playful and carefree life that any child deserves.

There are three typical adjustment patterns adopted by adults with hearing loss. The first one is to remain withdrawn into your own self. This provides a sense of safety and familiarity which can be a comforting way to lead your life. The second is to act "as if" one does not even have hearing loss. A positive attitude will help people to live a life with no barriers and thus, engage in optimal interaction. The final and third pattern is for the person to accept their hearing loss as a part of them without undervaluing oneself. This means understanding that one is forced to live life with this disability, however it is not the only thing that constitutes life’s meaning. Furthermore, many feel as if their inability to hear others during conversation is their fault. It's important that these individuals learn how to become more assertive individuals who do not lack fear when it comes to asking someone to repeat something or to speak a little louder. Although there is much fatigue and frustration that is produced from one’s inability to hear, it is important to learn from personal experiences in order to improve on one’s communication skills. In essence, these patterns will help adults with hearing loss deal with the communication barriers that are present.&lt;ref name="SCHERER"&gt;Scherer, M. J. (2004). The Personal Meaning of Hearing or Vision Loss. ''Connecting To Learn Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities.'' (pp. 41-55). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Workplace====
In most instances, people who are deaf find themselves working with hearing colleagues, where they can often be cut off from the communication going on around them. Interpreters can be provided for meetings and workshops, however are seldom provided for everyday work interactions. Communication of important information needed for jobs typically comes in the form of written or verbal summaries, which do not convey subtle meanings such as tone of voice, side conversations during group discussions, and body language. This can result in confusion and misunderstanding for the worker who is deaf, therefore making it harder to do their job effectively. Additionally, deaf workers can be unintentionally left out of professional networks, informal gatherings, and casual conversations among their collogues. Information about informal rules and organizational culture in the workplace is often communicated though these types of interactions, which puts the worker who is deaf at a professional and personal disadvantage. This could sever their [[job performance]] due to lack of access to information and therefore, reduce their opportunity to form relationships with their co-workers. Additionally, these communication barriers can all affect a deaf person’s career development. Since being able to effectively communicate with one's co-workers and other people relevant to one's job is essential to managerial positions, people with hearing loss can often be denied such opportunities.&lt;ref name="FOSTER" /&gt;

To avoid these situations in the workplace, individuals can take full-time or part-time sign language courses. In this way, they can become better able to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. Such courses teach the American Sign Language (ASL) language as most North Americans use this particular language to communicate. It is a visual language made up of specific gestures (signs), hand shapes, and facial expressions that contain their own unique grammatical rules and sentence structures &lt;ref&gt;Sign Language Classes for Individuals. (2013, January 1). Retrieved November 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By completing sign language courses, it ensures that deaf individuals feel a part of the workplace and have the ability to communicate with their co-workers and employer in the manner as other hearing employees do.

====Health care====
Not only can communication barriers between deaf and hearing people affect family relationships, work, and school, but they can also have a very significant effect on a deaf individual’s physical and [[Deaf mental health care|mental health care]]. As a result of poor communication between the health care professional and the deaf or hard of hearing patient, many patients report that they are not properly informed about their disease and prognosis. 
&lt;ref name="Medicina"&gt;Medicina Oral, Patología Oral y Cirugía Bucal. (2007, January 1). Retrieved October 31, 2014, from {{Cite journal |url=http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1698-69462007000800007&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=How to improve communication with deaf children in the dental clinic |journal=Medicina Oral, Patología Oral y Cirugía Bucal (Internet) |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=576–581 |accessdate=2014-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105235645/http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1698-69462007000800007&amp;script=sci_arttext |archivedate=2014-11-05 |df= |date=12/2007 |last1=López |first1=Gallardo |last2=Esther |first2=Nuria |last3=Martínez |first3=Mourelle |last4=Rosa |first4=María |last5=García |first5=Nova |last6=De |first6=Joaquín |last7=San Bernardino Alsmark |first7=Silvia }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This lack of or poor communication could also lead to other issues such as misdiagnosis, poor assessments, mistreatment, and even possibly harm to patients. Poor communication in this setting is often the result of health care providers having the misconception that all people who are deaf or hard of hearing have the same type of hearing loss, and require the same type of communication methods. In reality, there are many different types and range of hearing loss, and in order to communicate effectively a health care provider needs to understand that each individual with hearing loss has unique needs. This affects how individuals have been educated to communicate, as some communication methods work better depending on an individual’s severity of hearing loss. For example, assuming every deaf or hard of hearing patient knows American Sign Language would be incorrect because there are different types of sign language, each varying in signs and meanings. A patient could have been educated to use cued speech which is entirely different from ASL.&lt;ref name="Medicina" /&gt; Therefore, in order to communicate effectively, a health care provider needs to understand that each individual has unique needs when communicating.

Although there are specific laws and rules to govern communication between health care professionals and people who are deaf, they are not always followed due to the health care professional’s insufficient knowledge of communication techniques. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make assumptions about communicating with someone who is deaf, which can in turn cause them to use an unsuitable form of communication. 
Acts in countries such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that all health care providers are required to provide reasonable communication accommodations when caring for patients who are deaf. These accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters, CDIs, and technology such as Internet interpretation services. A qualified sign language interpreter will enhance communication between a deaf individual and a health care professional by interpreting not only a health professional’s verbal communication, but also their non-verbal such as expressions, perceptions, and body language. A Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is a sign language interpreter who is also a member of the Deaf community.&lt;ref&gt;Ramstead, A. (2014, January 15). The Role of the Certified Deaf Interpreter. Retrieved November 2, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |title=The Role of the Deaf Interpreter |accessdate=2014-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141105190523/http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |archivedate=2014-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They accompany a sign language interpreter and are useful for communication with deaf individuals who also have language or cognitive deficits. A CDI will transform what the health care professional communicates into basic, simple language. This method takes much longer, however it can also be more effective than other techniques. Internet interpretation services are convenient and less costly, but can potentially pose significant risks. They involve the use of a sign language interpreter over a video device rather than directly in the room. This can often be an inaccurate form of communication because the interpreter may not be licensed, is often unfamiliar with the patient and their signs, and can lack knowledge of medical terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, G., Mistler, L., Torrey, K., &amp; Depukat, R. (2013). Bridging Communication Gaps with the Deaf. Nursing, 43(11), 24-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from utilizing interpreters, healthcare professionals can improve their communication with deaf or hard of hearing patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient’s needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading to identify words. Exaggerated pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it even more difficult to understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.&lt;ref name="Medicina" /&gt;

===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===
A 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | date=2005-02-14 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archivedate=2008-09-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.

Some hope that a similar treatment will one day ameliorate hearing loss in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gubbels | first1=SP | last2=Woessner | first2=DW | last3=Mitchell | first3=JC | last4=Ricci | first4=AJ | last5=Brigande | first5=JV | title=Functional auditory hair cells produced in the mammalian cochlea by in utero gene transfer | journal=Nature | volume=455 | issue=7212 | pages=537–41 | year=2008 | pmid=18754012 | pmc=2925035 | doi=10.1038/nature07265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audition===
Besides research studies seeking to improve hearing, such as the ones listed above, research studies on the deaf have also been carried out in order to understand more about audition. Pijil and Shwarz (2005) conducted their study on the deaf who lost their hearing later in life and, hence, used cochlear implants to hear. They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.&lt;ref name="Carlson, N. R. 2010"&gt;Carlson, N. R. (2010).

'''High-altitude adaptation in humans''' is an instance of [[evolutionary adaptation|evolutionary modification]] in certain human populations, including those of [[Tibetan people|Tibet]] in Asia, the [[Andes]] of the Americas, and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in Africa, who have acquired the ability to survive at extremely high [[altitudes]]. This adaptation means irreversible, [[adaptive evolution|long-term physiological responses]] to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable [[ethology|behavioural]] and [[mutation|genetic changes]].

While the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen [[respiratory system|respiration]] and blood [[circulatory system|circulation]], when compared to the general lowland population.&lt;ref name=fris&gt;{{cite book|author=Frisancho AR|title=Human Adaptation and Accommodation|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_SYHBo42MC&amp;pg|pages=175–301 |isbn =0472095110|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Hillary Mayell |title=Three High-Altitude Peoples, Three Adaptations to Thin Air|date=24 February 2004 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2004/02/0224_040225_evolution.html |work=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andeans===

In contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high-altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate.&lt;ref name=beall07 /&gt; This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the [[fecundity|giving birth]] or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vitzthum |first1=Virginia J. |title=Fifty fertile years: anthropologists' studies of reproduction in high altitude natives |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179–189 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22357 |pmid=23382088}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in [[alveolus|alveolar]] area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in [[red blood cells]]. Though the physical growth in body size is [[stunted growth|delayed]], growth in lung volumes is accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frisancho|first1=A.

===Ethiopians===

The peoples of the [[Ethiopian highlands]] also live at extremely high altitudes, around {{convert|3000|m|ft}} to {{convert|3500|m|ft}}. Highland Ethiopians exhibit elevated haemoglobin levels, like Andeans and lowlander peoples at high altitudes, but do not exhibit the Andean’s increased in oxygen-content of haemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Beall CM |year=2006|title=Andean, Tibetan, and Ethiopian patterns of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia |journal=Integr Comp Biol |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=18–24 |pmid=21672719 |doi=10.1093/icb/icj004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among healthy individuals, the average haemoglobin concentrations are 15.9 and 15.0 g/dl for males and females respectively (which is lower than normal, almost similar to the Tibetans), and an average oxygen saturation of haemoglobin is 95.3% (which is higher than average, like the Andeans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Beall CM, Decker MJ, Brittenham GM, Kushner I, Gebremedhin A, Strohl KP |year=2002 |title=An Ethiopian pattern of human adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=99 |issue=26 |pages=17215–17218 |pmid=12471159 |pmc=139295 |doi=10.1073/pnas.252649199 |last2=Decker |last3=Brittenham |last4=Kushner |last5=Gebremedhin |last6=Strohl |bibcode=2002PNAS...9917215B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Ethiopian highlanders do not exhibit any significant change in blood circulation of the brain, which has been observed among the Peruvian highlanders (and attributed to their frequent altitude-related illnesses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Claydon VE, Gulli G, Slessarev M, Appenzeller O, Zenebe G, Gebremedhin A, Hainsworth R |year=2008|title=Cerebrovascular responses to hypoxia and hypocapnia in Ethiopian high altitude dwellers  |journal=Stroke |volume=39 |issue=2|pages=336–342 |pmid=18096845  |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.491498|last2=Gulli|last3=Slessarev|last4=Appenzeller|last5=Zenebe|last6=Gebremedhin|last7=Hainsworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, similar to the Andeans and Tibetans, the Ethiopian highlanders are immune to the extreme dangers posed by high-altitude environment, and their pattern of adaptation is definitely unique from that of other highland peoples.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt;

==Genetic basis==

The underlying [[molecular evolution]] of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently.&lt;ref name=mue /&gt; Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which
have evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of [[recent human evolution]]. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.&lt;ref name=bea00 /&gt;

=== Tibetans ===

Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and [[oxygen saturation|blood-oxygen]] levels are adaptive as [[Fitness (biology)|Darwinian fitness]]. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two [[allele]]s for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beall CM, Song K, Elston RC, Goldstein MC |year=2004 |title=Higher offspring survival among Tibetan women with high oxygen saturation genotypes residing at {{convert|4000|m|ft}}| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/39/14300 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=101|issue=39 |pages=14300–14304 |pmid=15353580|pmc=521103 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405949101|last2=Song |last3=Elston |last4=Goldstein |bibcode=2004PNAS..10114300B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequences of 50 Tibetans and 40 [[Han Chinese]] from [[Beijing]]. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (''[[EPAS1]]''). It was found that one [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) at ''EPAS1'' shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of [[phenotype|phenotypically observable]] evolution in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Native Village Youth |author2=Education news |title=Tibetans evolved at fastest pace ever measured |url=http://www.nativevillage.org/Archives/2011%20Archives/MAY%202011%20News/Tibetans%20Evolved%20at%20Fastest%20Pace%20Ever%20Measured.htm | date=May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated to occur in less than 3,000 years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population.&lt;ref name=yi /&gt; [[Mutations]] in ''EPAS1'', at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (''[[EGLN1]]'') (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (''[[PPARA]]''), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonson TS, Yang Y, Huff CD, Yun H, Qin G, Witherspoon DJ, Bai Z, Lorenzo FR, Xing J, Jorde LB, Prchal JT, Ge R |year=2010 |title=Genetic evidence for high-altitude adaptation in Tibet | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5987/72 |journal=Science |volume=329 |issue=5987|pages=72–75 |pmid=20466884 |doi=10.1126/science.1189406|last2=Yang |last3=Huff |last4=Yun |last5=Qin |last6=Witherspoon |last7=Bai |last8=Lorenzo |last9=Xing |last10=Jorde |last11=Prchal |last12=Ge |bibcode=2010Sci...329...72S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Sherpas]], known for their Himalayan hardiness, exhibit similar patterns in the ''EPAS1'' gene, which further fortifies that the gene is under [[Selection (biology)|selection]] for adaptation to the high-altitude life of Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanaoka M, Droma Y, Basnyat B, Ito M, Kobayashi N, Katsuyama Y, Kubo K, Ota M |year=2012 |title=Genetic variants in EPAS1 contribute to adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Sherpas | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0050566 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12|pages=e50566|pmid=23227185 |pmc=3515610|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050566|last2=Droma |last3=Basnyat |last4=Ito |last5=Kobayashi |last6=Katsuyama |last7=Kubo |last8=Ota |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750566H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2014 indicates that the mutant ''[[EPAS1]]'' gene could have been inherited from archaic [[hominin]]s, the [[Denisovans]].&lt;ref name="Huerta-Sanchez et al. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huerta-Sánchez|first1=Emilia |last2=Jin |first2=Xin |last3=Asan |last4=Bianba |first4=Zhuoma|last5=Peter|first5=Benjamin M. |last6=Vinckenbosch|first6=Nicolas|last7=Liang|first7=Yu|last8=Yi|first8=Xin|last9=He|first9=Mingze|last10=Somel|first10=Mehmet|last11=Ni|first11=Peixiang|last12=Wang|first12=Bo|last13=Ou|first13=Xiaohua|last14=Huasang|last15=Luosang|first15=Jiangbai|last16=Cuo|first16=Zha Xi Ping |last17=Li |first17=Kui |last18=Gao |first18=Guoyi |last19=Yin |first19=Ye |last20=Wang|first20=Wei |last21=Zhang |first21=Xiuqing |last22=Xu |first22=Xun|last23=Yang |first23=Huanming |last24=Li |first24=Yingrui |last25=Wang |first25=Jian |last26=Wang |first26=Jun |last27=Nielsen |first27=Rasmus |title=Altitude adaptation in Tibetans caused by introgression of Denisovan-like DNA |journal=Nature |date=2014 |volume=512 |issue=7513 |pages=194–197 |doi=10.1038/nature13408 |pmid=25043035 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..194H |display-authors=8 |pmc=4134395}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EPAS1'' and ''EGLN1'' are definitely the major genes for unique adaptive traits when compared with those of the Chinese and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peng Y, Yang Z, Zhang H, Cui C, Qi X, Luo X, Tao X, Wu T, Ouzhuluobu, Basang, Ciwangsangbu, Danzengduojie, Chen H, Shi H, Su B|year=2011 |title=Genetic variations in Tibetan populations and high-altitude adaptation at the Himalayas | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/2/1075.full |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28|issue=2|pages=1075–81|pmid=21030426 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq290|last2=Yang |last3=Zhang |last4=Cui |last5=Qi |last6=Luo |last7=Tao |last8=Wu |last13=Chen |last14=Shi |last15=Su }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genome analysis in 2014 revealed that the Tibetans inherited an equal mixture of genomes from the Nepalese-Sherpas and Hans, and they acquired the adaptive genes from the sherpa-lineage.

===Andeans===

The patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, ''EGLN1'' appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations.&lt;ref name=bigh /&gt; Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between ''EPAS1'' or ''EGLN1'' SNP [[genotype]]s and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bigham AW, Wilson MJ, Julian CG, Kiyamu M, Vargas E, Leon-Velarde F, Rivera-Chira M, Rodriquez C, Browne VA, Parra E, Brutsaert TD, Moore LG, Shriver MD |year=2013 |title=Andean and Tibetan patterns of adaptation to high altitude | journal=Am J Hum Biol|volume=25|issue=2|pages=190–197|pmid=23348729 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22358|last2=Wilson |last3=Julian |last4=Kiyamu |last5=Vargas |last6=Leon-Velarde |last7=Rivera-Chira |last8=Rodriquez |last9=Browne |last10=Parra |last11=Brutsaert |last12=Moore |last13=Shriver }}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou D, Udpa N, Ronen R, Stobdan T, Liang J, Appenzeller O, Zhao HW, Yin Y, Du Y, Guo L, Cao R, Wang Y, Jin X, Huang C, Jia W, Cao D, Guo G, Gamboa JL, Villafuerte F, Callacondo D, Xue J, Liu S, Frazer KA, Li Y, Bafna V, Haddad GG |title=Whole-genome sequencing uncovers the genetic basis of chronic mountain sickness in Andean highlanders |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=93|issue=S0002–9297(13)00331–5 | pages=452–62|year=2013 |pmid=23954164 |pmc=3769925 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.011|last2=Udpa |last3=Ronen |last4=Stobdan |last5=Liang |last6=Appenzeller |last7=Zhao |last8=Yin |last9=Du |last10=Guo |last11=Cao |last12=Wang |last13=Jin |last14=Huang |last15=Jia |last16=Cao |last17=Guo |last18=Gamboa |last19=Villafuerte |last20=Callacondo |last21=Xue |last22=Liu |last23=Frazer |last24=Li |last25=Bafna |last26=Haddad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopians===

The adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the [[amhara people|Amhara]] have inhabited altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|2400|m|ft}} for more than 70,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Human technical behavior in the African Middle Stone Age: The lithic assemblange of Porc-Epic Cave (Dire Dawa, Ethiopia)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10437-006-9000-7|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=177–197|doi=10.1007/s10437-006-9000-7|pmid=|author=Pleurdeau D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and [[oromo people|Oromo]], revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same [[locus (genetics)|gene location]] do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alkorta-Aranburu G, Beall CM, Witonsky DB, Gebremedhin A, Pritchard JK, Di Rienzo A|year=2012 |title=The genetic architecture of adaptations to high altitude in Ethiopia | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003110|pmid=23236293| pmc=3516565 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110|last2=Beall |last3=Witonsky |last4=Gebremedhin |last5=Pritchard |last6=Di Rienzo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including ''[[CBARA1]]'', ''[[VAV3]]'', ''[[ARNT2]]'' and ''[[THRB]]''. Two of these genes (''THRB'' and ''ARNT2'') are known to play a role in the [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|HIF-1 pathway]], a pathway implicated in previous work reported in Tibetan and Andean studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">In the [[law of the European Union]], '''indicative limit values''', more exactly '''indicative occupational exposure limit values''' (IOELVs), are [[human]] [[Acute exposure|exposure]] limits to [[hazard]]ous [[Chemical substance|substances]] specified by the [[Council of the European Union]] based on expert [[research]] and advice.

They are not binding on [[European Union member state|member states]] but must be taken into consideration in setting national [[occupational exposure limit]]s. Some member states have pre-existing national limits lower than the IOELV and are not required to revise these upwards. In practice, most member states adopt the IOELV but there are some variances upwards and downwards.&lt;ref&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walters &amp; Grodzki (2006) ''pp''53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
A system of IOELVs was first introduced in 1980 by [[directive 80/1107/EEC]] but the first list of 27 substances was not  created until '''directive 91/322/EC''' in 1991. Member states had until 31 December 1993 to implement national limits. This first list was amended by directive 2006/15/EC in 2006 which transferred 10 of the 27 to a different regulatory regime. A second list was defined in directive 96/94/EEC but this was [[repeal]]ed by directive 2000/39/EC.&lt;ref name="dd"&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, directive 80/1107/EEC was repealed and replaced by a new regime under the chemical agents directive ([[directive 98/24/EC]]). The directive defines '''occupational exposure limit value''' as "the limit of the time-[[weighted average]] of the [[concentration]] of a chemical agent in the [[air]] within the [[breathing zone]] of a worker over a specified reference period."&lt;ref&gt;Art.2(d)&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 of the directive led to the creation of the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] to advise the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Union]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995D0320:EN:HTML L 188, 9.8.1995, p.14-15]&lt;/ref&gt; There have subsequently been two directives establishing further lists of IOELVs: 2000/39/EC and 2006/15/EC. {{As of|2008}}, the IOELVs under '''directive 91/322/EC''' remain in force but under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=European Commission | work=Health and Safety at Work | publisher=Employment and Social Affairs | accessdate=2008-04-24 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/occupational_en.htm | title=Occupational Exposure Limits and Biological Limit Values | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416032949/http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/occupational_en.htm | archivedate=2008-04-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third list of IOELVs, now under directive 98/24/EC, is expected in the first half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/europe/euronews/dossiers/ioelv3.htm | publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] | title=Third list of indicative occupational exposure limit values (IOELVs) (98/24/EC) | work=On the Horizon | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19056">Many [[laboratories]] contain significant risks, and the prevention of '''laboratory accidents''' requires great care and constant vigilance. Examples of risk factors include high voltages, high and low pressures and temperatures, corrosive and toxic chemicals, and [[biohazard]]s including infective organisms and their toxins.

Measures to protect against laboratory accidents include safety training and enforcement of laboratory safety policies, safety review of experimental designs, the use of [[personal protective equipment]], and the use of the [[buddy system]] for particularly risky operations.

In many countries, laboratory work is subject by health and safety legislation. In some cases, laboratory activities can also present [[environmental health]] risks, for example, the accidental or deliberate discharge of toxic or infective material from the laboratory into the environment.

== Chemical hazards ==
Hazardous [[chemicals]] present physical and/or health threats to workers in clinical, industrial, and academic laboratories. Laboratory chemicals include [[cancer]]-causing agents (carcinogens), toxins (e.g., those affecting the [[liver]], [[kidney]], and [[nervous system]]), irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, as well as agents that act on the blood system or damage the [[lungs]], [[skin]], [[eye]]s, or [[mucous membrane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/laboratory-safety-manual/Pages/ch8.aspx|title = Chapter 8 - Chemical Hazards|website = sp.ehs.cornell.edu|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological hazards ==
[[File:Biohazard symbol (black and yellow).png|thumb|Biohazard symbol (black and yellow)]]

=== Biological agents and biological toxins ===
Many laboratory workers encounter daily exposure to biological hazards. These hazards are present in various sources throughout the laboratory such as [[blood]] and [[body fluids]], culture specimens, [[body tissue]] and [[cadavers]], and [[laboratory animals]], as well as other workers.

These are federally regulated biological agents (e.g., [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[prions]]) and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/biologicalagents/index.html | title=Biological Agents and Biological Toxins | publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/pandemicflu/index.html | title=An additional OSHA Safety and Health Topics page on Pandemic Influenza has been added in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. | publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Anthrax]]''' - Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by a spore-forming bacterium called ''Bacillus anthracis''.
#'''Avian Flu''' - [[Avian influenza]] is caused by ''Influenza A viruses''.
#'''[[Botulism]]''' - Cases of botulism are usually associated with consumption of preserved foods.
#'''Foodborne Disease''' - Foodborne illnesses are caused by [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[parasites]], toxins, [[metals]], and [[prions]] (microscopic protein particles). Symptoms range from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening neurologic, hepatic and renal syndromes.
#'''Hantavirus''' - Hantaviruses are transmitted to humans from the dried droppings, urine, or saliva of mice and rats.
#'''Legionnaires’ Disease''' - Legionnaires’ disease is a bacterial disease commonly associated with water-based aerosols.
#'''[[Molds]] and [[Fungi]]''' - Molds and fungi produce and release millions of spores small enough to be [[air]], [[water]], or insect-borne which may have negative effects on human health including, allergic reactions, asthma, and other respiratory problems.
#'''[[Plague (disease)|Plague]]''' - The [[World Health Organization]] reports 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague every year. A bioterrorist release of plague could result in a rapid spread of the pneumonic form of the disease, which could have devastating consequences.
#'''Ricin''' - Ricin is one of the most toxic and easily produced plant toxins. It has been used in the past as a bioterrorist weapon and remains a serious threat.
#'''[[Smallpox]]''' - Smallpox is a highly contagious disease unique to humans. It is estimated that no more than 20 percent of the population has any immunity from previous vaccination.
#'''[[Tularemia]]''' - Tularemia is also known as "rabbit fever" or "deer fly fever" and is extremely infectious. Relatively few bacteria are required to cause the disease, which is why it is an attractive weapon for use in bioterrorism.

== Physical hazards and others ==
Besides exposure to chemicals and biological agents, laboratory workers can also be exposed to a number of physical hazards. Some of the common physical hazards that they may encounter include the following: [[ergonomic]], [[ionizing radiation]], non-ionizing
radiation and noise hazards.

=== Ergonomic Hazards ===
Laboratory workers are at risk for repetitive motion injuries during routine laboratory procedures such as pipetting, working at microscopes, operating microtomes, using cell counters and keyboarding at computer workstations. Repetitive motion injuries develop over time and occur when muscles and joints are stressed, tendons are inflamed, nerves are pinched and the flow of blood is restricted. Standing and working in awkward positions in front of laboratory hoods/biological safety cabinets can also present ergonomic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-ergonomics.pdf | title=Laboratory Safety – Ergonomics for the Prevention of Musculoskeletal Disorders | publisher=OSHA | accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darragh AR, Harrison H, Kenny S. Effect of ergonomics intervention on workstations of microscope workers. American Journal of Occupational Therapy. 2008. 62:61-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ionizing Radiation ===
[[File:ISO 7010 W003.svg|thumb|Danger radiation zone warning sign]]
Ionizing radiation sources are found in a wide range of occupational settings, including laboratories. These radiation sources can pose a considerable health risk to affected workers if not properly controlled. Any laboratory possessing or using radioactive isotopes must be licensed by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) and/or by a state agency that has been approved by the NRC, 10 CFR 31.11 and 10 CFR 35.12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/radiationionizing/index.html | title=Ionizing Radiation | accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental objectives of radiation protection measures are:

#to limit entry of radionuclides into the [[human body]] (via [[ingestion]], [[inhalation]], [[absorption (skin)|absorption]], or through open wounds) to quantities as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and always within the established limits;

#to limit exposure to external radiation to levels that are within established dose limits and as far below these limits as is reasonably achievable.

== Safety hazards ==

=== Autoclaves and sterilizers === 
Workers should be trained to recognize the potential for exposure to burns or cuts that can occur from handling or sorting hot sterilized items or sharp instruments when removing them from '''[[autoclaves]]'''/'''[[sterilizers]]''' or from steam lines that service the autoclaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov | title=An OSHA QuickFacts entitled '''Laboratory Safety – Autoclaves/Sterilizers''' has been developed to sup-plement this section and is available online at osha.gov. | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centrifuges ===
'''[[Centrifuges]]''', due to the high speed at which they operate, have great potential for injuring users if not operated properly. Unbalanced centrifuge rotors can result in injury, even death. Sample container breakage can generate aerosols that may be harmful if inhaled.
The majority of all centrifuge accidents are the result of user error.

=== Compressed gases ===
[[File:Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle.jpg|thumb|Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle]]
Laboratory standard for '''[[compressed gas]]'''
# Is a gas or mixture of gases in a container having an absolute pressure exceeding 40 pounds per square inch (psi) at 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21.1&amp;nbsp;°C); or&lt;ref name="compressed gas streamline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/uagc/EHS/power_point/compressed_gas_streamline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206164546/http://www.asu.edu/uagc/EHS/power_point/compressed_gas_streamline.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Is a gas or mixture of gases having an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 130&amp;nbsp;°F (54.4&amp;nbsp;°C) regardless of the pressure at 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21.1&amp;nbsp;°C); or&lt;ref name="compressed gas streamline" /&gt; 
# Is a liquid having a vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 100&amp;nbsp;°F (37.8&amp;nbsp;°C) as determined by ASTM ([[American Society for Testing and Materials]])

Within laboratories, compressed gases are usually supplied either through fixed piped gas systems or individual cylinders of gases. Compressed gases can be [[toxic]], [[flammable]], [[oxidizing]], [[corrosive]], or [[Inert gas|inert]]. Leakage of any of these gases can be hazardous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/compressed/compress.html#tphp | title=About Compressed gases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Store, handle, and use compressed gases ====
*All cylinders whether empty or full must be stored upright.&lt;ref name="compressed gases"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathesongas.com/pdfs/products/guide-to-safe-handling-of-compressed-gases-publ-03.pdf | title=Store, handle, and use compressed gases}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secure cylinders of compressed gases. Cylinders should never be dropped or allowed to strike each other with force.&lt;ref name="compressed gases" /&gt;
*Transport compressed gas cylinders with protective caps in place and do not roll or drag the cylinders.&lt;ref name="compressed gases" /&gt;

=== Cryogens and dry ice ===
'''Cryogens''', substances used to produce very low temperatures [below -153&amp;nbsp;°C (-243&amp;nbsp;°F)], such as [[liquid nitrogen]] (LN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which has a boiling point of -196&amp;nbsp;°C (-321&amp;nbsp;°F), are commonly used in laboratories.&lt;ref name="C &amp; DI"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.drs.illinois.edu/SafetyLibrary/CryogensAndDryIce| title=Safety Library Cryogens And DryIce | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a cryogen, solid [[carbon dioxide]] or [[dry ice]] which converts directly to carbon dioxide gas at -78&amp;nbsp;°C (-109&amp;nbsp;°F) is also often used in laboratories. Shipments packed with dry ice, samples preserved with liquid [[nitrogen]], and in some cases, techniques that use cryogenic liquids, such as cryogenic grinding of samples, present potential hazards in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="C &amp; DI" /&gt;

Hand protection is required to guard against the hazard of touching cold surfaces. It is recommended that Cryogen Safety Gloves be used by the worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.airproducts.com/company/Sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/product-safety-safetygrams.aspx|title = Safetygrams|website = www.airproducts.com|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/esh/eshmanual/pdfs/ESHch36.pdf | title=Stanford University: SLAC Environment, Safety, and Health Manual, Chapter 36 | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eye]] protection is required at all times when working with cryogenic fluids. When pouring a cryogen, working with a wide-mouth Dewar flask or around the exhaust of cold boil-off gas, use of a full face shield is recommended.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbl.gov/ehs/pub3000/CH29/CH29.html | title=ES&amp;H Manual, Chapter 29: Safe Handling of cryogenic liquids | publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal protective equipments ===
{{main|Personal protective equipment}}'''Personal protective equipment''' or PPE are equipments worn to prevent against exposure of hazardous substances.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)|url = http://www.hse.gov.uk/toolbox/ppe.htm|website = www.hse.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, PPE does not eliminate the risks of hazards but it helps protect the user from the exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Laboratory Safety PPE {{!}} Yale Environmental Health and Safety|url = http://ehs.yale.edu/laboratory-safety-ppe|website = ehs.yale.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make a workplace safer, it should provide instructions and training of how to use and choose proper PPE in different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Protective nitrile gloves.jpg|thumb|158x158px|Nitrile gloves]]

PPE includes: 
* Long-sleeved shirts, [[lab coat]]s, aprons.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
* [[goggle]]s&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
* Safety [[Medical glove|gloves]];&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
** There are 2 common types of safety gloves that are widely used in high school or university laboratory,  Latex and Nitrile gloves. Latex gloves have a high sensitivity when it comes to contact and fine control which is very suitable for surgery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-12.pdf|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-12.pdf|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hands, Nitrile gloves are the gloves that do not have latex protein which cost twice. It was known as the most durable, resisted to tear and many chemicals. Beside all the benefits, Nitrile gloves also have drawbacks since it can oxidize silver and high reactive metals as these metals can react with sulfur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, wearer should have an extra care while wearing this type of protective gloves.  
* Face shield or safety

=== Electrical ===
In the laboratory, there is the potential for workers to be exposed to electrical hazards including [[electric shock]], electrocutions, fires and [[explosions]]. Damaged electrical cords can lead to possible shocks or electrocutions. A flexible electrical cord may be damaged by door or window edges, by staples and fastenings, by equipment rolling over it, or simply by aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAquickfacts-lab-safety-electrical-hazards.pdf | title=Electrical Hazards | publisher=OSHA | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for possible electrocution or electric shock or contact with electrical hazards can result from a number of factors, including the following:
*Faulty electrical equipment/instrumentation or wiring;&lt;ref name="Electrical"&gt;https://www.lanl.gov/safety/electrical/docs/elec_hazard_awareness_study_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Damaged receptacles and connectors;&lt;ref name="Electrical" /&gt; and
*Unsafe work practices.&lt;ref name="Electrical" /&gt;

=== Fire ===
[[File:Segnale incendio.svg|thumb|Fire|154x154px]]
'''[[Fire]]''' is the most common serious hazard that one faces in a typical laboratory. While proper procedures and training can minimize the chances of an accidental fire, laboratory workers should still be prepared to deal with a fire emergency should it occur. In dealing with a laboratory fire, all containers of infectious materials should be placed into autoclaves, incubators, refrigerators, or freezers for containment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/programs-and-procedures/hazard-recognition-control/fire-hazards | title=Fire Hazards control | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bench-top fires in laboratory spaces are not uncommon. Large laboratory fires are rare. However, the risk of severe injury or death is significant because fuel load and hazard levels in labs are typically very high. Laboratories, especially those using solvents in any quantity, have the potential for flash fires, explosion, rapid spread of fire, and high toxicity of products of combustion (heat, smoke, and flame)
[[File:Fire blanket.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|Fire blanket]]

===Glassware===
* Broken glass is a hazard for a sharps related injury.
* Correct eye protection should be worn in most experiments involving glassware.
* Inserting a glass rod through a stopper can introduce the possibility of a stab wound or sharps injury if the rod breaks.  The hands must be protected.  
* Tubing should be cut from a barbed connection so as not to shatter the connection.  A quick disconnect is preferable to a barbed fitting.
* Ground glass joints can become a breaking hazard if they freeze.

* Broken and other waste glass should be discarded in a separate container specially marked to indicate its contents.
* Glassware should always be labeled as to its contents.
* Rapid heating (or cooling) may cause uneven [[thermal expansion]] putting too much [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] on the surface and cause it to [[fracture]]. Fracturing is a concern when people new to laboratory become impatient and heat glassware, especially the larger pieces, too fast. Heating of glassware should be slowed using an insulating material, such as metal foil or wool, or specialized equipment such as [[heated bath]]s, [[heating mantle]]s or laboratory grade [[hot plate]]s to avoid fracturing.
* Hot glass looks like cold glass, so a person must be careful to avoid grabbing hot glassware.
* Glassware can explode if the exhaust is in any way restricted, so any apparatus should be vented.  
* Glassware can implode under negative pressure
* When connecting joints, it is the responsibility of the person overseeing the experiment to select the correct seal. For example, PTFE tape, bands, and fluoroether-based grease or oils may emit toxic [[perfluoroisobutylene]] fumes if the rated temperature limits are exceed.&lt;ref&gt;Haiduc, I., "Silicone Grease: A Serendipitous Reagent for the Synthesis of Exotic Molecular and Supramolecular Compounds", Organometallics 2004, volume 23, pp. 3-8.  {{DOI|10.1021/om034176w}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Serendipitous Reactions Involving a Silicone Grease|author = Lucian C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47627">[[Food]] may be accidentally or deliberately contaminated by [[microbiology|microbiological]], chemical or physical hazards.

In contrast to microbiologically caused foodborne illness, the link between exposure and effect of chemical hazards in foods is usually complicated by cumulative low doses and the delay between exposure and the onset of symptoms. Chemical hazards include environmental contaminants, food ingredients (such as iodine), heavy metals, [[mycotoxins]], natural toxins, improper storage, processing contaminants, and veterinary medicines.

Incidents have occurred because of poor harvesting or storage of grain, use of banned veterinary products, industrial discharges, [[human error]] and deliberate adulteration and fraud.&lt;ref name=Thomson2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1757-837X.2012.00129.x |title=Incidents and impacts of unwanted chemicals in food and feeds |year=2012 |last1=Thomson |first1=Barbara |last2=Poms |first2=Roland |last3=Rose |first3=Martin |journal=Quality Assurance and Safety of Crops &amp; Foods |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=77–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of an incident ==
An "incident" of chemical food contamination may be defined as an episodic occurrence of adverse health effects in humans (or animals that might be consumed by humans) following high exposure to particular chemicals, or instances where episodically high concentrations of chemical hazards were detected in the food chain, and traced back to a particular event.&lt;ref name=Thomson2012/&gt;

== Socio-economic impacts ==
Information on the impacts of these incidents is fragmentary and unsystematic, ranging from thousands of dollars to meet the cost of monitoring analysis, to many millions of dollars due to court prosecutions, bankruptcy, product disposal, compensation for revenue loss, damage to brand or reputation, or loss of life.&lt;ref name=Thomson2012/&gt;

==List of notable incidents==

===Ancient times===
*Roman Empire – There is speculation that the Romans, in particular the elite, suffered chronic to severe lead poisoning due to the ubiquity of lead in e.g. lined pots in which acidic foodstuffs were boiled, over and above any mere exposure to lead in water pipes. They also used [[Lead(II) acetate|sugar of lead]] to sweeten their wines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://io9.com/5877587/the-first-artificial-sweetener-poisoned-lots-of-romans|title=The first artificial sweetener poisoned lots of Romans|first=Keith |last=Veronese|date=Jan 20, 2012|work=io9.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
*Europe - numerous incidents of human poisoning due to the consumption of rye bread made from grain [[Ergot#History|infected with ergot fungi]]

===19th century===
*1850s - [[Swill milk scandal]] in New York
*1857 – adulteration of bread with [[alum]] in London, causing rickets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/injepidemiology32_336_337_2003.pdf |title=On the adulteration of bread as a cause of rickets |publisher=Ph.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1857 - poisoning of bread with arsenic in Hong Kong targeting the colonial community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Kate|title='Caution!

*1930s – A striking example of OPIDN [[Organophosphate poisoning]] occurred during the 1930s Prohibition Era when thousands of men in the American South and Midwest developed arm and leg weakness and pain after drinking a "medicinal" alcohol substitute called "[[Jamaica ginger|Ginger Jake]]", which contained an adulterated Jamaican ginger extract containing [[tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate]] (TOCP), which resulted in partially reversible neurologic damage. The damage resulted in the limping "Jake Leg" or "Jake Walk" which were terms frequently used in the blues music of the period. Europe experienced outbreaks of TOCP poisoning from contaminated [[abortifacient]]s. Morocco experienced outbreaks of TOCP poisoning from contaminated cooking oil.

The [[Italian Wine and Food Institute]], which represents Italian wine exporters in New York, was quoted here as saying that all Italian wine shipped to the United States is subjected to strict quality control in order to win the Italian government's seal of approval. Italy ships more wine to the United States than any other wine-producing nation, but most of its wine exports go to France and Germany, in that order, much of it in bulk for use in cutting domestic wines with higher-alcohol Italian varieties. It is far worse in scale than the scandal that virtually eliminated Austrian wines from the market last year. Some Austrian wine makers were found to have added ethylene glycol, a toxic, sweetening element, to their wines, and the discovery wiped out export sales. Ethylene glycol is also used in antifreeze.

In the field of [[obstetrics]], '''lochia''' is the vaginal discharge after giving birth ([[puerperium]]) containing [[blood]], [[mucus]], and [[Uterus|uterine]] tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murkoff |first1=Heidi |authorlink1=Heidi Murkoff |last2=Eisenberg |first2=Arlene |last3=Hathaway |first3=Sandee |date=2002 |title=What To Expect When You're Expecting |edition=3rd |publisher=Workman |location=New York |isbn=0-7611-2132-3 |page=383 |quote=This discharge of leftover blood, muscus, and tissue from your uterus, known as lochia, is normally as heavy as (and sometimes even heavier than) a menstrual period for the first three to ten postpartum days.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lochia discharge typically continues for 4 to 6 weeks after [[childbirth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oppenheimer |first1=LW |last2=Sherriff |first2=EA |last3=Goodman |first3=JD |last4=Shah |first4=D |last5=James |first5=CE |date=July 1986 |title=The duration of lochia |journal=Br J Obstet Gynaecol |pmid=3755355 |volume=93 |issue=7 |pages=754–757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is known as the [[postpartum period]].

It is sterile for the first 2 
days, but not so by the third or fourth day, as the uterus begins to be colonized by vaginal commensals such as non-hemolytic [[streptococci]] and ''[[E. coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanretty |first=Kevin P. |others=Illustrated by Ian Ramsden and Robin Callander |date=2009 |title=Obstetrics Illustrated |edition=7th |publisher=Churchill-Livingston |isbn=978-0-7020-3066-6 |page=337 |url=http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/ob-gyn/obstetrics-illustrated-paperback/9780702030666/ |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
It progresses through three stages:&lt;ref name=pmid10772198&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sherman |first1=D. |last2=Lurie |first2=S. |last3=Frenkel |first3=E. |last4=Kurzweil |first4=Y. |last5=Bukovsky |first5=I. |last6=Arieli |first6=S. |date=1999 |title=Characteristics of normal lochia |journal=Am J Perinatol |pmid=10772198 |doi=10.1055/s-1999-6818 |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=399–402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Lochia rubra''' (or cruenta) is the first discharge, Composed of blood, shreds of fetal membranes, [[decidua]], [[vernix caseosa]], [[lanugo]] and membranes. It is red in color because of the large amount of blood it contains. It typically lasts no longer than 3 to 5 days after birth.
#'''Lochia serosa''' is the term for lochia that has thinned and turned brownish or pink in color. It contains serous [[exudate]], [[erythrocytes]], [[leukocytes]], [[cervix|cervical]] [[mucus]] and microorganisms. This stage continues until around the tenth day after delivery. Lochia serosa which persists to some weeks after birth can indicate late postpartum hemorrhaging, and should be reported to a physician.
#'''Lochia alba''' (or purulenta) is the name for lochia once it has turned whitish or yellowish-white. It typically lasts from the second through the third to sixth weeks after delivery. It contains fewer [[red blood cell]]s and is mainly made up of [[white blood cell|leukocytes]], [[epithelium|epithelial cells]], [[cholesterol]], [[fat]], [[mucus]] and [[microorganisms]]. Continuation beyond a few weeks can indicate a genital lesion, which should be reported to a physician.
Note: [[Ambulant]] patients &lt; 2 weeks, [[wikt:moribund#Adjective|Moribund]] Patients &gt; 2 weeks, [[Preterm]] Delivery &lt; 2 weeks, [[Twin]] Delivery &gt; 2 weeks.

==Complications==
In general, lochia has an odor similar to that of normal menstrual fluid. Any offensive odor or change to a greenish color indicates contamination by organisms such as chlamydia or [[saprophytic]].

Lochia that is retained within the uterus is known as '''lochiostasis'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=lochioschesis - definition of lochioschesis in the Medical dictionary - by the Free Online Medical Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lochioschesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; or lochioschesis, and can result in '''lochiometra'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=lochiometra - definition of lochiometra at the Free Dictionary by Farlex |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lochiometra}}&lt;/ref&gt; (distention of the uterus - pushing it out of shape). '''Lochiorrhea''' describes an excessive flow of lochia and can indicate infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shevtsova |first=Maria |date=&lt;!--no date--&gt; |title=Postpartum Bleeding – The Healing Wound |website=Mother How |url=http://motherhow.com/postpartum-bleeding/ |quote=Also, a profuse lochia discharge three weeks after childbirth can be a {{sic|sing|nolink=y|hide=y|expected=sign}} of lochiorrhea. Lochiorrhea may indicate an infectious disease in a woman or a sign of disturbed blood coagulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''midwife''' is a [[health professional]] specializing in [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], [[postpartum]], women's sexual and [[reproductive health]] (including annual [[gynecology|gynecological]] exams, [[family planning]], [[menopausal]] care and others), and newborn care.&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Essential Competencies"/&gt; Their education and training in [[midwifery]] equips them to recognise the variations of normal progress of labor, and understand how to deal with deviations from normal. They may intervene in high risk situations such as [[breech birth]]s, [[twin birth]]s and births where the baby is in a [[Presentation (obstetrics)|posterior position]], using non-invasive techniques. When a pregnant woman requires care beyond the midwife's [[scope of practice]], they refer women to [[obstetricians]] or [[Maternal-fetal medicine|perinatologists]], who are [[medical specialist]]s in complications related to pregnancy and birth, including surgical and instrumental deliveries.&lt;ref name="business-being-born"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/movies/09born.html|title=The Business of Being Born (film)|last=Epstein|first=Abby|accessdate=30 October 2009|work=The New York Times|date=9 January 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213155538/http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/movies/09born.html|archivedate=13 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Midwifery around the World: A study in the role of midwives in local communities and healthcare systems|last=Carson|first=A|date=May–June-2016|website=annals of global health|publisher=Elsevier Inc|doi=10.1016/j.aogh.2016.04.617|volume=82|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many parts of the world, these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women. In others, only the midwife is available to provide care, and in yet other countries many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives.

Many [[developing countries]] are investing money and training for midwives as these services are needed all over the world. Some [[primary care]] services are currently lacking due to the shortage of money being funded for these resources.

== Definition and etymology==
According to the definition of the [[International Confederation of Midwives]], which has also been adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]]:&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt;

{{quote|A midwife is a person who has successfully completed a [[midwifery]] education programme that is recognised in the country where it is located and that is based on the ICM Essential Competencies for Basic Midwifery Practice&lt;ref name="Essential Competencies"/&gt; and the framework of the ICM Global Standards for Midwifery Education;&lt;ref name="Global Standards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://internationalmidwives.org/what-we-do/education-coredocuments/global-standards-education/ | title=Global Standards for Basic Midwifery Education | publisher=International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) | accessdate=2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925091426/http://internationalmidwives.org/what-we-do/education-coredocuments/global-standards-education/ | archivedate=25 September 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who has acquired the requisite qualifications to be registered and/or legally licensed to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title ‘midwife’; and who demonstrates competency in the practice of [[midwifery]].}}

The word derives from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:mid#Old English|mid]]'', "with" and ''[[wikt:wif#Old English|wif]]'', "woman", and thus originally meant "with-woman", that is, the person who is ''with'' the ''mother'' (woman) at childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= midwife|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118259|publisher=The Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Midwife: Word History|url= https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=midwife|publisher= The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition.

The midwife is recognised as a responsible and accountable professional who works in partnership with women to give the necessary support, care and advice during pregnancy, labour and the postpartum period, to conduct births on the midwife’s own responsibility and to provide care for the newborn and the infant. This care includes preventative measures, the promotion of normal birth, the detection of complications in mother and child, the accessing of medical
care or other appropriate assistance and the carrying out of emergency measures.

The midwife has an important task in health counselling and education, not only for the woman, but also within the family and the community. This work should involve antenatal education and preparation for parenthood and may extend to women’s health, sexual or reproductive health and child care.

A midwife may practise in any setting including the home, community, hospitals, clinics or health units.&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt;

'''Education, training and regulation'''

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programs are three-year full-time university programs leading to a bachelor's degree in midwifery (Bachelor of Midwifery) with additional one-year full-time programs leading to an honours bachelor's degree in midwifery (Bachelor of Midwifery (Honours)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahpra.gov.au/Education/Approved-Programs-of-Study.aspx |title=Approved Programs of Study |publisher=Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526032729/http://www.ahpra.gov.au/Education/Approved-Programs-of-Study.aspx |archivedate=26 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The postgraduate midwifery programs (for registered midwives) lead to master's degrees in midwifery (Master in Midwifery, Master in Midwifery (Research), MSc Midwifery). There are also postgraduate midwifery programs (for registered nurses who wish to become midwives) leading to a bachelor's degree or equivalent qualification in midwifery (Bachelor of Midwifery, Graduate Diploma in Midwifery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwivesaustralia.com.au/?page_id=224 |title=Becoming a Midwife |publisher=Midwives Australia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605072655/http://www.midwivesaustralia.com.au/?page_id=224 |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives in Australia must be registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency in order to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title 'midwife' or 'registered midwife'.

'''Practice'''

Midwives work in a number of settings including hospitals, birthing centres, community centres and women’s homes. They may be employed by health services or organisations, or self-employed as privately practising midwives. All midwives are expected to work within a defined scope of practice and conform to ongoing regulatory requirements that ensure they are safe and autonomous practitioners.

===Canada===


Midwifery was reintroduced as a regulated profession in most of [[Canada]]'s ten provinces in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schroff |first=F. |year=1997 |title=The New Midwifery |location=Toronto |publisher=Women's Press |isbn=0-88961-224-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this legalization, some midwives had practiced in a legal "grey area" in some provinces.&lt;ref name="sask"&gt;[https://www.saskatchewanmidwives.com/midwifery-in-saskatchewan/ Midwifery in Saskatchewan], Midwives Association of Saskatchewan&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, a midwife in BC was charged with practicing without a medical license.&lt;ref name="mic"&gt;[https://www.lawnow.org/midwifery-canada/ Midwifery in Canada], Law Now&lt;/ref&gt;

After several decades of intensive political [[lobbying]] by midwives and consumers, fully integrated, regulated and publicly funded [[midwifery]] is now part of the health system in the provinces of [[British Columbia]] (regulated since 1995), [[Alberta]] (regulated since 2000, fully funded since 2009) [[Saskatchewan]] (regulated since 1999), [[Manitoba]] (regulated since 1997), [[Ontario]] (regulated since 1991), [[Quebec]] (regulated since 1999), and [[Nova Scotia]] (regulated since 2006), and in the [[Northwest Territories]] (regulated since 2003) and [[Nunavut]](regulated since 2008).&lt;ref name="mic"/&gt;  In 2010, Midwifery legislation was proclaimed in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Only [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Yukon]] have no legislation in place for the practice of [[midwifery]].&lt;ref name="mic"/&gt;

====Education, training and regulation====

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programs are four-year full-time university programs leading to bachelor's degrees in midwifery (B.H.Sc. in Midwifery, Bachelor of Midwifery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianmidwives.org/midwifery-education.html |title=Midwifery Education in Canada |publisher=Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121150504/http://www.canadianmidwives.org/midwifery-education.html |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In British Columbia, the program is offered at the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwifery.ubc.ca|title=Home - Midwifery Program|author=|date=|website=www.midwifery.ubc.ca|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307230944/https://midwifery.ubc.ca/|archivedate=7 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta offers a Bachelor of Midwifery program. In Ontario, the Midwifery Education Program (MEP) is offered by a consortium of [[McMaster University]], [[Ryerson University]] and [[Laurentian University]]. In Manitoba the program is offered by [[University College of the North]]. In [[Quebec]], the program is offered at the [[Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières]]. In northern Quebec and Nunavut, Inuit women are being educated to be midwives in their own communities.{{fact|date=June 2018}} 

There are also "bridging programs" for internationally educated midwives at [[Ryerson University]] in Ontario and at the University of British Columbia.  A federally funded pilot project called the Multi-jurisdictional Midwifery Bridging Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwiferybridging.ca |title=midwiferybridging.ca |publisher=midwiferybridging.ca |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been offered in [[Western Canada]] in the past, but funding was discontinued when they expanded their midwifery program.  A new program was reinstated through the University of British Columbia in 2016 called the Internationally Educated Midwives Bridging Program IEMBP.

Midwives in Canada must be registered, after a process of assessment by the provincial regulatory bodies, in order to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title 'midwife',  'registered midwife' or, the French-language equivalent, 'sage femme'.

====Practice====

From the original 'alternative' style of [[midwifery]] in the 1960s and 1970s, [[midwifery]] practice is offered in a variety of ways within regulated provinces: midwives offer continuity of care within small group practices, choice of birthplace, and a focus on the woman as the primary decision-maker in her maternity care. When women or their newborns experience complications, midwives will work in consultation with an appropriate specialist. Registered midwives have access to appropriate diagnostics like blood tests and ultrasounds and can prescribe some medications. Founding principles of the Canadian model of [[midwifery]] include informed choice, choice of birthplace, continuity of care from a small group of midwives and respect for the woman as the primary decision maker. Midwives typically have hospital privileges and support women's right to choose where she will have her baby.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The legal recognition of [[midwifery]] has brought midwives into the mainstream of [[health care in Canada|health care]] with universal funding for services, hospital privileges, rights to prescribe medications commonly needed during pregnancy, birth and postpartum, and rights to order blood work and ultrasounds for their own clients and full consultation access to physicians. To protect the tenets of [[midwifery]] and support midwives to provide woman-centered care, the regulatory bodies and [[Professional body|professional associations]] have legislation and standards in place to provide protection, particularly for choice of birth [[home birth|place]], informed choice and continuity of care. All regulated midwives have malpractice insurance. Any unregulated person who provides care with 'restricted acts' in regulated provinces or territories is practicing [[midwifery]] without a license and is subject to investigation and prosecution.

Prior to legislative changes, very few Canadian women had access to [[midwifery]] care, in part because it was not funded by the [[health care system]]. Legalizing [[midwifery]] has made midwifery services available to a wide and diverse population of women and in many communities the number of available midwives does not meet the growing demand for services. [[Midwifery]] services are free to women living in provinces and territories with regulated [[midwifery]].

The national professional associations in Canada is the Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianmidwives.org/ |title=Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109174414/http://www.canadianmidwives.org/ |archivedate=9 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====

On 16 March 1995, the BC government announced the approval of regulations governing [[midwifery]] and establishing the College of Midwives of BC. In 1996, the Health Professional Council released a draft of Bylaws for the College of Midwives of BC which received Cabinet approval on 13 April 1997. In 1998, midwives were officially registered with the College of Midwives of BC.&lt;ref name="cmbc.bc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmbc.bc.ca |title=cmbc.bc.ca |publisher=cmbc.bc.ca |date=1 January 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917090243/http://www.cmbc.bc.ca/ |archivedate=17 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In BC, midwives are primary care providers for women in all stages of pregnancy, from prenatal to six weeks postpartum. Midwives also care for newborns. To see the approximate proportion of women whose primary birth attendant was a midwife in British Columbia see, "What Mothers Say: The Canadian Maternity Experiences Survey. Public Health Agency of Canada. Ottawa, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/rhs-ssg/pdf/survey-eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610144203/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/rhs-ssg/pdf/survey-eng.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives in BC can deliver natural births in hospitals or homes. If a complication arises in a pregnancy, labour, birth or postpartum, a midwife will consult with a specialist such as an obstetrician or paediatrician.
Core competencies and restricted activities are included in the BC Health Professions Act Midwives Regulation.
As of April 2009, the scope of practice for midwives allows them to prescribe certain prescription drugs, use acupuncture for pain relief, assist a surgeon in a caesarean section delivery and to perform a vacuum extraction delivery. These specialized practices require additional education and certification.

As of November 2015, the College of Midwives of British Columbia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmbc.bc.ca/pdf.shtml?List-of-Registrants|title=Register of Current &amp; Former Registrants |publisher=College of Midwives of British Columbia |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported  247 General, 2 Temporary, 46 Non-practicing Registrant midwives. There were 2 midwives per 100,000 people in BC in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Institute for Health Information document titled, Number of Health Personnel in Selected Professions by Registration Status, 2006. This data has the following proviso, "Due to the variation in regulatory requirements, interprofessional comparison should be interpreted with caution."&lt;/ref&gt;

A midwife must be registered with the College of Midwives of BC in order to practice. To continue licensure midwives must maintain regular recertification in neonatal resuscitation and management of maternal emergencies, maintain the minimum volume of clinical care (40 women), participate in peer case reviews and continuing education activities.&lt;ref name="cmbc.bc.ca"/&gt;

The University of British Columbia (UBC) has a four-year Bachelor of Midwifery program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwifery.ubc.ca/midwifery.htm|title=Home - Midwifery Program|author=|date=|website=www.midwifery.ubc.ca|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UBC [[midwifery]] program is poised to double in size thanks to an increase in government funding. Graduation of students will increase to 20 per year.

In terms of proffesional associations, BC has both the College of Midwives of BC&lt;ref name="cmbc.bc.ca"/&gt; and the Midwives Association of BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcmidwives.com |title=bcmidwives.com |publisher=bcmidwives.com |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021021749/http://www.bcmidwives.com/ |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mozambique ===
When a 16-year civil war ended in 1992, Mozambique's health care system was devastated and one in ten women were dying in childbirth. There were only 18 [[obstetrician]]s for a population of 19 million. In 2004, Mozambique introduced a new health care initiative to train midwives in emergency obstetric care in an attempt to guarantee access to quality medical care during pregnancy and childbirth. The newly introduced midwives system now perform major surgeries including [[Cesareans]] and [[hysterectomies]]. 

As the figures now stand, Mozambique is one of the few countries on track to achieve the [[United Nations Millennium Development Goal|MDG]] of reducing the maternal death rate by 75% by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/birth-of-a-surgeon/introduction/747/ PBS documentary ''Birth of a Surgeon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225081550/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/birth-of-a-surgeon/introduction/747/ |date=25 December 2014 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
'''Education, training and regulation'''

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programs are four-year full-time university programs leading to a bachelor's degree in midwifery (HBO-bachelor Verloskunde).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knov.nl/samenwerken/tekstpagina/489/midwifery-in-the-netherlands/|publisher=The Royal Dutch Organisation of Midwives (KNOV): |title=Midwifery in the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four colleges for midwifery in the Netherlands: in Amsterdam, Groningen, Rotterdam and Maastricht. Midwives are called ''vroedvrouw'' (knowledge woman), ''vroedmeester'' (knowledge master, male), or ''verloskundige'' (deliverance experts) in Dutch.

'''Practice'''

Midwives are independent specialists in physiologic birth. In the Netherlands, home birth is still a common practice, although rates have been declining during the past decades. Between 2005-2008, 29% of babies were delivered at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/gezondheid-welzijn/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2009/2009-2696-wm.htm?Languageswitch=on|publisher=CVZ, Central Bureau of Statistics|title=Fewer women give birth at home|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001075455/http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/gezondheid-welzijn/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2009/2009-2696-wm.htm?Languageswitch=on|archivedate=1 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure fell to 23% delivered at home between 2007-2010 according to [[Midwifery]] in the Netherlands, a 2012 pamphlet by The Royal Dutch Organization for Midwives.&lt;ref name="The Royal Dutch Organization of Midwives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Midwifery in the Netherlands |url=http://www.knov.nl/docs/uploads/Midwifery_in_The__Netherlands__20120730__groot.pdf |publisher=(KNOV)|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 it has dropped further to 13.4%.[https://assets.perined.nl/docs/353d9249-9875-4cb3-9c86-f078ae3f7aef.pdf perined.nl/jaarboek2104.pdf].

Midwives are generally organized as private practices, some of those are hospital-based. In-hospital outpatient childbirth is available in most hospitals. In this case, a woman's own midwife delivers the baby at the delivery room of a hospital, without intervention of an obstetrician. In all settings, midwives will transfer care to an obstetrician in case of a complicated childbirth or need for emergency intervention.

Apart from childbirth and immediate postpartum care, midwives are the first line of care in pregnancy control and education of mothers-to-be. Typical information that is given to mothers includes information about food, alcohol, life style, travel, hobbies, sex, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verloskundigestadspraktijk.nl/ |language=Dutch |publisher= |title=Obstetric Practice in the City of Groningen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[midwifery]] practices give additional care in the form of preconceptional care and help with fertility problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchmidwife.com/voor-zwangeren/zwanger-worden/kinderwensspreekuur/|language=Dutch|title=Preconceptional care|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113201201/http://www.dutchmidwife.com/voor-zwangeren/zwanger-worden/kinderwensspreekuur/|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All care by midwives is legal and it is totally reimbursed by all insurance companies. This includes prenatal care, childbirth (by midwives or obstetricians, at home or in the hospital), as well as postpartum/postnatal care for mother and baby at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expatarrivals.com/article/having-a-baby-in-the-netherlands |title=Having a baby in the Netherlands |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010084408/http://www.expatarrivals.com/article/having-a-baby-in-the-netherlands |archivedate=10 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvz.nl/zorgpakket  |publisher=CVZ, College for Healthcare Insurances |title=Care package}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[Midwifery]] is a regulated profession with no connection to Nursing.  Midwifery is a profession with a distinct body of knowledge and its own scope of practice, code of ethics and standards of practice. The midwifery profession has knowledge, skills and abilities to provide a primary complete maternity service to childbearing women on its own responsibility.

'''Education, training and regulation'''

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programmes are three-year full-time (three trimesters per year) tertiary programmes leading to a bachelor's degree in midwifery (Bachelor of Midwifery or Bachelor of Health Science (Midwifery)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.midwife.org.nz/education/where-to-start-becoming-a-midwife |title=Where to Start...

These programmes are offered by [[Otago Polytechnic]] in Dunedin, [[Ara Institute of Canterbury]] (formally CPIT) in Christchurch, [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] in Hamilton and [[Auckland University of Technology]] (AUT) in Auckland. Several schools have satellite programmes such as Otago with a programme in Southland, Wanaka, Wellington, Palmerston North, Wanganui, and Wairarapa - and AUT with student cohorts in various sites in the upper North Island.&lt;ref name="New Zealand College of Midwives"/&gt; The postgraduate midwifery programmes (for registered midwives) lead to postgraduate degrees or equivalent qualifications in midwifery (Postgraduate Certificate in Midwifery, Postgraduate Diploma in Midwifery, Master of Midwifery, PhD Professional Doctorate).

The Midwifery First Year of Practice Programme (MFYP) is a compulsory national programme for all New Zealand registered midwifery graduates, irrespective of work setting. The New Zealand College of Midwives (the NZCOM) is contracted by the funder, Health Workforce New Zealand (HWNZ), to provide the programme nationally in accordance with the programme specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Midwifery First Year of Practice Programme |url= https://www.midwife.org.nz/quality-practice/midwifery-first-year-of-practice/ |publisher= New Zealand College of Midwives |accessdate= 2015 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180128211540/https://www.midwife.org.nz/quality-practice/midwifery-first-year-of-practice |archivedate= 28 January 2018 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives in New Zealand must be registered with the  Midwifery Council of New Zealand in order to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title 'midwife'.

'''Practice'''

Women may choose a midwife, a [[General practitioner|General Practitioner]] or an Obstetrician to provide their maternity care. About 78 percent choose a midwife (8 percent GP, 8 percent Obstetrician, 6 percent unknown).&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Health Information Service: "Report on Maternity - Maternal and Newborn Information 2003."&lt;/ref&gt; Midwives provide maternity care from early pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum. The [[midwifery]] scope of practise covers normal pregnancy and birth. The midwife will either consult or transfer care where there is a departure from a normal pregnancy. Antenatal care is normally provided in clinics, and postnatal care is initially provided in the woman’s home. Birth can be in the home, a primary birthing unit, or a hospital. [[Midwifery]] care is fully funded by the Government.  (GP care may be fully funded. Private obstetric care will incur a fee in addition to the government funding.)

Increase in midwifery education has led to advances in impoverished countries.

'''Education, training and regulation'''

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programs are three-year full-time university programs leading to honours bachelor's degrees in midwifery: BSc (Hons) Midwifery, Bachelor of Midwifery (Hons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmc.org.uk/education/becoming-a-nurse-or-midwife/becoming-a-midwife/ |title=Becoming a midwife |publisher=The Nursing and Midwifery Council |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118040809/http://www.nmc.org.uk/education/becoming-a-nurse-or-midwife/becoming-a-midwife |archivedate=18 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The postgraduate midwifery programs (for registered midwives) lead to master's degrees in midwifery (MSc Midwifery, MSc Advanced Practice Midwifery). There are also undergraduate and postgraduate midwifery programs (for graduates with a relevant degree who wish to become midwives) leading to degrees or equivalent qualifications in midwifery (BSc (Hons) Midwifery, Bachelor of Midwifery (Hons), Graduate Diploma in Midwifery, Postgraduate Diploma in Midwifery, MSc Midwifery).
[[Midwifery]] training consists of classroom-based learning provided by select universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://studentmidwife.net/tobe/universities.330/|title=Midwifery Universities in the UK|author=|date=|website=studentmidwife.net|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032348/https://studentmidwife.net/tobe/universities.330/|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with hospital- and community-based training placements at [[NHS Trusts]].

[[Midwifery]] students do not pay tuition fees and are eligible for additional financial support while training. Funding varies depending on which country within the UK the student is located in: students are eligible for NHS bursaries in addition to a grant of 1,000 pounds a year, and neither has to be repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/Typesoffinance/DG_171537 |title=Student Finance, Loans and Universities - GOV.UK |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date=1 September 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003032953/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/Typesoffinance/DG_171537 |archivedate=3 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortened-course students, who are already registered adult nurses, have different funding arrangements, are employed by the local NHS Trust via the Strategic Health Authority (SHA), and are paid salaries. This varies between universities and SHAs, with some students being paid their pre-training salaries, while others are employed as a Band 5 and still others are paid a proportion of a Band 5 salary.

Midwives must be registered with the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] in order to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title 'midwife' or 'registered midwife', and must also have a Supervisor of Midwives through their local supervising authority.

'''Practice'''

Midwives are practitioners in their own right in the [[United Kingdom]].  They take responsibility for the [[antenatal]], [[childbirth|intrapartum]] and [[postnatal]] care of women up until 28 days after the birth, or as required thereafter. Midwives are the lead [[Health profession|health care professional]] attending the majority of births, whether at home, in a midwife-led unit or in a hospital (although most births in the UK occur in hospitals).

In December 2014 the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] updated its guidance regarding where women should give birth. The new guidance states that midwife-led units are safer than hospitals for women having straightforward (low risk) pregnancies. Its updated guidance also confirms that home birth is as safe as birth in a midwife-led unit or a traditional labour ward for the babies of low-risk pregnant women who have already had at least one child previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/midwife-care-during-labour-safest-women-straightforward-pregnancies|title=NICE confirms midwife-led care during labour is safest for women with straightforward pregnancies|author=|date=|website=nice.org.uk|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105213256/https://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/midwife-care-during-labour-safest-women-straightforward-pregnancies|archivedate=5 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intrapartum Care"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg190/evidence/cg190-intrapartum-care-full-guideline3 |title=Care of Healthy Women and Their Babies During Childbirth |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |work=National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health |date=December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212090530/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg190/evidence/cg190-intrapartum-care-full-guideline3 |archivedate=12 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many midwives also work in the community. The role of community midwives includes making initial appointments with pregnant women, managing [[clinic]]s, undertaking postnatal care in the home and attending [[home birth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcm.org.uk/college/your-career/students/student-life-e-newsletter/student-life-october-2010/career-profile-community-midwife/?locale=en |title=Career Profile: Community Midwife - Royal College of Midwives |publisher=Rcm.org.uk |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101022138/http://www.rcm.org.uk/college/your-career/students/student-life-e-newsletter/student-life-october-2010/career-profile-community-midwife/?locale=en |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A community midwife typically has a pager, is responsible for a particular area and can be contacted by ambulance control when needed.  Sometimes they are paged to help out in a hospital when there are insufficient midwives available.

Most midwives work within the [[National Health Service]], providing both hospital and community care, but a significant proportion work independently, providing total care for their clients within a community setting. However, recent government proposals to require insurance for all health professionals is threatening independent [[midwifery]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6435279.stm |title=Threat to Independent Midwifery |publisher=BBC News |date=10 March 2007 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408062448/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6435279.stm |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives are at all times responsible for the women they are caring for. They must know when to refer complications to medical staff, act as the women's advocate, and ensure that mothers retain choice and control over [[childbirth]].

Most practising midwives in the United Kingdom are female: men account for less than 0.5 per cent of midwives on the register of the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|NMC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmc-uk.org/Documents/Statistical%20analysis%20of%20the%20register/NMC-Statistical-analysis-of-the-register-202006-202007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Practice'''

Midwives work with women and their families in many settings. They generally support and encourage [[natural childbirth]] in all practice settings. Laws regarding who can practice [[midwifery]] and in what circumstances vary from state to state. Many states have [[birthing center]]s where a midwife may work individually or as a group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.birthcenters.org/open-abc/bc-regs.php |title=Birth Center Regulations &amp;#124; American Association of Birth Centers |publisher=Birthcenters.org |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides additional clinical opportunities for student midwives.

CPMs provide on-going care throughout pregnancy and continuous, hands-on care during labor, birth and the immediate postpartum period. They practice as autonomous health professionals working in a network of relationships with other maternity care professionals who can provide consultation and collaboration when needed. Although qualified to practice in any setting, they have particular expertise in providing care in homes and free-standing birth centers, and own or work in over half of the birth centers in the U.S. today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nacpm.org/about-cpms/professional-standards/scope-of-practice/ |title=CMP Scope of Practice |publisher=National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM) |accessdate=21 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805140052/http://nacpm.org/about-cpms/professional-standards/scope-of-practice/ |archivedate=5 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nacpm.org/about-cpms/who-are-cpms/ |title=Who are CPMs |publisher=National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM) |accessdate=21 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220081826/http://nacpm.org/about-cpms/who-are-cpms/ |archivedate=20 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNMs and CMs work in a variety of settings including private practices, hospitals, birth centers, health clinics, and home birth services. They supervise not only pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period care for women and their newborns, but also provide gynecological care for all women and have autonomy and prescriptive authority in most states. They manage women's healthcare from puberty through post-menopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwife.org/Our-Scope-of-Practice|title=Our Scope of Practice|author=|date=|website=www.midwife.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029042700/http://midwife.org/Our-Scope-of-Practice|archivedate=29 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With appropriate training, they can also first assist in cesarean (operative) deliveries and perform limited ultrasound examinations. It is possible for CNMs/CMs practice independently of physicians, establishing themselves as health care providers in the community of their choice.

== Men in midwifery ==
[[File:Jordmor jim- oslo.jpeg|thumb|A male midwife in [[Oslo, Norway]]]]

Men rarely practice midwifery for cultural and historical reasons. In ancient Greece, midwives were required by law to have given birth themselves, which prevented men from joining their ranks. In 17th century Europe, some [[barber surgeons]], all of whom were male, specialized in births, especially births requiring the use of surgical instruments. This eventually developed into a professional split, with women serving as midwives and men becoming [[obstetricians]]. Men who work as midwives are called ''midwives'' (or ''male midwives'', if it is necessary to identify them further) or ''accoucheurs''; the term ''midhusband'' (based on a misunderstanding of the etymology of ''midwife'') is occasionally encountered, mostly as a joke. In previous centuries, they were called ''man-midwives'' in English.&lt;ref name="Pilkenton 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Midwifery: A career for men in nursing |last = Pilkenton |first = Deanna |last2 = Schorn|first2 = Mavis N |date = February 2008 |journal = Men In Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Smellie]] is credited with innovations on the shape of [[forceps]]. This invention corresponds with the development towards obstetrics. He advised male midwives to wear dresses in order to reduce controversy over having a man present at birth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Midwifery: A Career for Men in Nursing|journal=Men in Nursing Journal|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 21st century, most developed countries allow men to train as midwives. However, it remains very rare. In the United Kingdom, even after the passing of the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Royal College of Midwives]] barred men from the profession until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11202075/No-job-for-a-man-Meet-the-male-midwives.html|title=No job for a man?

In the US, there remain a small, stable or minimally declining number of male midwives with full scope training (CNMs/CMs), comprising approximately 1% of the membership of the [[American College of Nurse-Midwives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midwife.org/ACNM/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000001720/CoreDataSurvey_2010_one-pager.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nursing.vanderbilt.edu/msn/pdf/nmw_midwiferyformen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320052445/https://nursing.vanderbilt.edu/msn/pdf/nmw_midwiferyformen.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Southeast Asian cultures, some or even most of the traditional midwives are men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rosemary |last=Gianno |title='Women are not brave enough' Semelai male midwives in the context of Southeast Asian cultures |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |volume=160 |issue=1 |year=2004 |pages=31–71 |jstor=27868101 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7547">The '''National Survey of Family Growth''' ('''NSFG''') is a [[Opinion poll|survey]] conducted by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] division of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to understand trends related to fertility, family structure, and demographics in the United States.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm|title = National Survey of Family Growth|publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and details==

The National Survey of Family Growth is conducted in five-year cycles. In each cycle, surveys are administered via personal interviews with people at homes. The interviewees generally comprise only the civilian, non-institutionalized population.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/about_nsfg.htm|title = About the National Survey of Family Growth|publisher = National Survey of Family Growth|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cycles so far have been:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_questionnaires.htm|title = Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2011-2015 (ongoing, data not available)&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

While Cycles 1-5 surveyed only women, Cycle 6 and later surveyed both men and women and used households as the unit of analysis. Cycle 6 surveyed 12,571 respondents 15–44 years of age: 7,643 females and 4,928 males. The 2006-2010 NSFG surveyed 22,682 interviews: over 10,000 interviews with men and more than 12,000 interviews with women.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; For Cycle 6 onward, the surveys were conducted in person by female interviewers who are hired and managed by the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The survey samples are intended to be nationally representative but not necessarily representative at subnational levels (such as individual states, ethnicities, or religions).&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Data==

For the survey cycles that have been completed, data is available both in the form of [[portable document format]] summaries and as full data files. In addition, program statements are available in SAS, SPSS, and STATA.&lt;ref name=cycle1/&gt;

Key statistics are also browsable online.&lt;ref name=statistics&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/key_statistics.htm|title = NSFG - Key Statistics|publisher = National Survey of Family Growth|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSFG data is also mirrored on the website of the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/48|title = National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) Series|publisher = [[Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research]], [[University of Michigan]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==

===Claims===

The NSFG website claims that the NSFG is used as follows:&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

* by scholars in the [[behavioral science]]s (e.g., [[sociology]], [[demography]], and [[economics]]) to study [[marriage]], [[divorce]], [[fertility]], and [[family]] life;
* by scholars in public health to study reproductive, maternal and infant health topics;
* by agencies of the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]], to brief senior officials and to inform program decision-making, in research programs and in health and social service programs.
* by state and local governments to plan health and social service programs;
* by private-sector research organizations which distribute the information to the public and to policy makers; and
* by the press, to prepare articles on a number of topics related to health and family life.

===Academic research===

The NSFG website claims that the NSFG has been cited in "more than 600 journal articles, NCHS reports, and book chapters shown in our publication lists."&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The research citing the NSFG is concentrated more on topics related to family planning, contraception, abortion, and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Estimates of contraceptive failure from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth|last = Kost|first = Kathryn|last2 = Singh|first2 = Susheela|last3 = Vaughan|first3 = Barbara|last4 = Trussell|first4 = James|last5 = Bankole|first5 = Akinrinola|journal = [[Contraception (journal)|Contraception]]|volume = 77|issue = 1|pages = 10–21|date = January 2008|doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2007.09.013|pmid=18082661|pmc=2811396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3124699.html|title = Are All Contraceptive Failures Unintended Pregnancies?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4162">'''New World Syndrome''' is a set of [[non-communicable disease]]s brought on by consumption of [[junk food]] and a [[sedentary lifestyle]], especially common to [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|the indigenous peoples]] of the "[[New World]]" (i.e. of [[the Americas]]). [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania]] and [[Circumpolar peoples]], and perhaps other populations of [[Asian people|Asiatic]] origin are similarly affected and perhaps genetically predisposed.&lt;ref name="Gracey1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gracey|first=Michael|year=1995|title=New World syndrome in Western Australian aborigines|journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=220–225|issn=0305-1870|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.1995.tb01985.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119247811/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and shortened [[life expectancy|life span]].

==Causes==

New World Syndrome is linked to a change from a [[traditional diet]]  and [[physical exercise|exercise]] to a [[Western diet]] and a sedentary lifestyle. Along with the lack of money. Traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion.&lt;ref name="Atlantic2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shell|first=Ellen Ruppel|year=2001|title=New World Syndrome - Spam and turkey tails have turned Micronesians into Macronesians.

[[File:Neuron colored.jpg|thumb|right| Poor diet in early childhood affects the number of [[neuron]]s in parts of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12793518 | volume=6 | issue=3 | title=Nutritional effects on neuron numbers | journal=Nutritional Neuroscience |date=June 2003 | author=Bedi KS | pages=141–52| doi=10.1080/1028415031000098549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Nutritional neuroscience''' is the scientific discipline that studies the effects various components of the diet such as [[minerals]], [[vitamins]], [[protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s, fats, dietary supplements, [[synthetic hormones]], and [[food additives]] have on [[neurochemistry]], [[neurobiology]], [[behavior]], and [[cognition]].

Recent research on nutritional mechanisms and their effect on the brain show they are involved in almost every facet of neurological functioning including alterations in [[neurogenesis]], [[neurotrophic factors]], [[neural pathway]]s and  [[neuroplasticity]], throughout the life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19698201 | doi=10.1017/S0029665109990188 | volume=68 | issue=4 | title=New insights into nutrition and cognitive neuroscience | journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society |date=November 2009 | author=Dauncey MJ | pages=408–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively speaking, the [[brain]] consumes an immense amount of energy in comparison to the rest of the body. The human brain is approximately 2% of the human body mass and uses 20–25% of the total energy expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fonseca-Azevedo K., Herculano-Houzel S. | year = 2012 | title = Metabolic constraint imposes tradeoff between body size and number of brain neurons in human evolution | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 45| pages = 18571–18576 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1206390109| last2 = Herculano-Houzel | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10918571F | pmid=23090991 | pmc=3494886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function.&lt;ref name="alpha" /&gt; Insufficient intake of selected vitamins, or certain metabolic disorders, affect [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] by disrupting the nutrient-dependent processes within the body that are associated with the management of energy in neurons, which can subsequently affect neurotransmission, [[synaptic plasticity]], and cell survival.&lt;ref name="alpha"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2421 |title=Brain foods: The effects of nutrients on brain function |year=2008 |last1=Gómez-Pinilla |first1=Fernando |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=568–78 |pmid=18568016 |pmc=2805706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minerals==
Deficiency or excess of essential minerals (e.g. iron, zinc, copper, and magnesium) can disrupt brain development and neurophysiology to affect behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alamy M. |author2=Bengelloun W. A. | year = 2012 | title = Malnutrition and brain development: an analysis of the effects of inadequate diet during different stages of life in rat | url = | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 1463–1480 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, minerals have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schrag M. |author2=Mueller C. |author3=Oyoyo U. |author4=Smith M.

===Iron===
Iron is essential for several critical metabolic enzymes and a deficiency of this mineral can disrupt brain development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chang S. |author2=Zeng L. |author3=Brouwer I.

Hypozincemia is usually a nutritional deficiency, but can also be associated with [[malabsorption]], [[diarrhea]], [[acrodermatitis enteropathica]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[liver disease]], chronic [[renal disease]], [[sickle-cell disease]], [[diabetes]], [[malignancy]], pyroluria, and other chronic [[illness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GPnotebook|886046736|zinc deficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prasad AS |title=Zinc deficiency : Has been known of for 40 years but ignored by global health organisations |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7386 |pages=409–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12595353 |pmc=1125304 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7386.409 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7386/409}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also occur after [[bariatric surgery]], heavy metal exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=El-Safty Ibrahim A M |author2=Gadallah Mohsen |author3=Shafik Ahmed |author4=Shouman Ahmed E | year = 2002 | title = Effect of mercury vapour exposure on urinary excretion of calcium, zinc and copper: relationship to alterations in functional and structural integrity of the kidney | url = | journal = Toxicol Ind Health | volume = 18 | issue = 8| pages = 377–388 | pmid = 15119526 | doi=10.1191/0748233702th160oa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Funk Day, Brady  | year = 1987 | title = Displacement of zinc and copper from copper-induced metallothionein by cadmium and by mercury: in vivo and ex vivo studies | url = | journal = Comp Biochem Physiol C | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 1–6 | pmid = 2881702 | doi=10.1016/0742-8413(87)90133-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tartrazine. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Zinc deficiency is typically the result of inadequate dietary intake of zinc, disease states that promote zinc losses, or physiological states that require increased zinc. Populations that consume primarily plant based diets that are low in bioavailable zinc often have zinc deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Solomons, N.W.

=====Anorexia=====
{{Main|Anorexia (symptom)}}

Zinc deficiency may cause a decrease in [[appetite]] which can degenerate into [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] or [[anorexia nervosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21846317 | volume=3 | issue=3 | title=Zinc as an appetite stimulator - the possible role of zinc in the progression of diseases such as cachexia and sarcopenia | journal=Recent Patents on Food, Nutrition &amp; Agriculture |date=September 2011 | author=Suzuki H, Asakawa A, Li JB | pages=226–31 | doi=10.2174/2212798411103030226| author2=and others | displayauthors=1 | last3=Li | last4=Tsai | last5=Amitani | last6=Ohinata | last7=Komai | last8=Inui }}&lt;/ref&gt; Appetite disorders, in turn, cause [[malnutrition]] and, notably, inadequate zinc intake. Anorexia itself is a cause of zinc deficiency, thus leading to a vicious cycle: the worsening of anorexia worsens the zinc deficiency. A 1994 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that zinc (14&amp;nbsp;mg per day) doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Birmingham C. L. |author2=Goldner E. M. |author3=Bakan R. | year = 1994 | title = Controlled trial of zinc supplementation in anorexia nervosa | doi = 10.1002/1098-108X(199404)15:3&lt;251::AID-EAT2260150308&gt;3.0.CO;2-# | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 251–255 | pmid = 8199605 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cognitive and motor function impairment=====
Cognitive and motor function may also be impaired in zinc deficient children. Zinc deficiency can interfere with many organ systems especially when it occurs during a time of rapid growth and development when nutritional needs are high, such as during infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sanstead H. H. | year = 2000 | title = Zinc nutriture as related to brain | url = | journal = J. Nutr. | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 140S–146S  | displayauthors = etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[animal studies]], rats who were deprived of zinc during early fetal development exhibited increased emotionality, poor memory, and abnormal response to stress which interfered with performance in learning situations.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Black MM |title=The Evidence Linking Zinc Deficiency with Children's Cognitive and Motor Functioning, |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=133 |issue=5 Suppl 1 |pages=1473S–6S |year=2003 |pmid=12730446 |doi= |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12730446 |pmc=3137935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc deprivation in monkeys showed that zinc deficient animals were emotionally less mature, and also had cognitive deficits indicated by their difficulty in retaining previously learned problems and in learning new problems.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;  Human observational studies show weaker results.  Low maternal zinc status has been associated with less attention during the neonatal period and worse motor functioning.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Black MM |title=Zinc deficiency and child development |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=68 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=464S–9S |year=1998 |pmid=9701161 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9701161 |pmc=3137936}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some studies, supplementation has been associated with motor development in very low [[birth weight]] infants and more vigorous and functional activity in infants and toddlers.&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt;

Plasma zinc level has been associated with many psychological disorders. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear in most instances. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that zinc deficiency could play a causal role in the etiology of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=J|author2=Oteiza |title=Zinc and the ERK kinases in the developing brain|journal=Neurotoxicity Research|year=2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=128–141|doi=10.1007/s12640-011-9291-6|pmid=22095091|pmc=4316815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, zinc supplementation has been reported to improve measures of depression in randomized double blind placebo controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20087376 | doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.158 | volume=64 | issue=3 | title=Effect of zinc supplementation on mood states in young women: a pilot study |date=March 2010 | author=Sawada T, Yokoi K | journal=Eur J Clin Nutr | pages=331–3| last2=Yokoi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper===
Copper is important for the function of many enzymes in the brain. Notably, dopamine β-mono-oxygenase is affected by copper deficiency leading to increased dopamine and decreased norepinephrine levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson K. T., Prohaska J. R. | year = 2009 | title = Copper deficiency in rodents alters dopamine b-mono-oxygenase activity, mRNA and protein level | url = | journal = British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 18–28 | pmid = 19079842 | last2 = Prohaska | doi = 10.1017/S0007114508162961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both copper deficiency and toxicity can interfere with brain development and function.

====Deficiency====
The neurodegenerative syndrome of copper deficiency has been recognized for some time in ruminant animals, in which it is commonly known as "[[swayback]]".&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; The disease involves a nutritional deficiency in the trace element [[copper]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jaiser S. R. |author2=Winston G.

On the other hand, [[Menkes disease]] is a genetic disorder of copper deficiency involving a wide variety of symptoms that is often fatal.&lt;ref name="Kodama"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kodama H. |author2=Fujisawa C. | year = 2009 | title = Copper metabolism and inherited copper transport disorders: molecular mechanisms, screening, and treatment | url = | journal = Metallomics | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 42–52 | doi=10.1039/b816011m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Neurological presentation=====
Copper deficiency can cause a wide variety of neurological problems including, [[myelopathy]], peripheral [[neuropathy]], and [[optic neuropathy]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kumar N | year = 2006 | title = Copper deficiency myelopathy (human swayback) | url = | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 81 | issue = 10| pages = 1371–1384 | pmid = 17036563 | doi = 10.4065/81.10.1371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Myelopathy=====
Sufferers typically present difficulty walking ([[gait]] difficulty) caused by [[sensory ataxia]] (irregular muscle coordination) due to [[dorsal column]] dysfunction&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; or degeneration of the spinal cord ([[myelopathy]]).&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar"&gt;Jaiser, S. R., &amp; Winston, G. P. (2008). Copper deficiency myelopathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord: why is the phenotype so similar?" ''Journal of Neurology'' 255, P569.&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with ataxic gait have problems balancing and display an unstable wide walk. They often feel tremors in their torso, causing side way jerks and lunges.&lt;ref name="Gait"&gt;Ataxic Gait Demonstration. Online Medical Video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpiEprzObIU&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;

In brain MRI, there is often an increased [[T2 (MRI)|T2]] signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with [[myelopathy]] caused by copper deficiency.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MRI" /&gt; T2 signalling is often an indicator of some kind of neurodegeneration. There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord, the cervical cord or sometimes both.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; Copper deficiency myelopathy is often compared to [[subacute combined degeneration]] (SCD).&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt; [[Subacute combined degeneration]] is also a degeneration of the spinal cord, but instead [[vitamin B12]] deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging.&lt;ref name="MRI"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bolamperti L. |author2=Leone M.

=====Peripheral neuropathy=====
Another common symptom of copper deficiency is [[peripheral neuropathy]], which is numbness or tingling that can start in the extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pineles"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pineles S.

Copper Deficiency Masquerading as Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Cord and Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Advances in clinical neuroscience and rehabilitation, http://www.acnr.co.uk/JA07/ACNR_JA07_abnwinner.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation was lost in the sternum, and markedly reduced [[proprioception]] or sensation about the self's orientation.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, masquerade" /&gt; Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral [[neuropathy]] can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.

=====Optic neuropathy=====
Some patients suffering from copper deficiency have shown signs of vision and color loss.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; The vision is usually lost in the peripheral views of the eye.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; The bilateral vision loss is usually very gradual.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spinazzi"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spinazzi M. |author2=De Lazzari F. |author3=Tavolato B. |author4=Angelini C. |author5=Manara R. |author6=Armani M. | year = 2007 | title = Myelo-optico-neuropathy in copper deficiency occurring after partial gastrectomy.

====Toxicity====
Copper toxicity can occur from excessive supplement use, eating acid foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, exposure to excess copper in drinking water, or as the result of an inherited metabolic disorder in the case of [[Wilson's disease]]. A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as [[hydroxyl radical]] in a manner similar to [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton chemistry]].&lt;ref name=PubMed&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Radiat Res. | author = Held KD | date = May 1996 | volume = 145 | issue = 5 |pages = 542&amp;ndash;53 | title = Role of Fenton chemistry in thiol-induced toxicity and apoptosis | doi = 10.2307/3579272 | pmid = 8619019 | publisher = Radiation Research Society | jstor = 3579272| last2 = Sylvester | first2 = F. Craig | last3 = Hopcia | first3 = Karen L. | last4 = Biaglow | first4 = John E. | displayauthors = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed [[oxidative stress]], and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity.

Some of the effects of aging may be associated with excess copper.&lt;ref name="pmid17259340"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brewer GJ |title=Iron and copper toxicity in diseases of aging, particularly atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease |journal=Exp.

However, it is unknown at this stage whether the copper contributes to the mental illness, whether the body attempts to store more copper in response to the illness, or whether the high levels of copper are the result of the mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wolf T.

===Manganese===
Manganese is a component of some [[enzymes]] and stimulates the development and activity of other enzymes.  Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the principal [[antioxidant]] in [[mitochondria]].  Several enzymes activated by manganese contribute to the [[metabolism]] of [[carbohydrates]], [[amino acids]], and [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine.

====Toxicity====
Manganese poisoning is a [[toxic]] condition resulting from chronic exposure to [[manganese]] and first identified in 1837 by [[James Couper (academic)|James Couper]].&lt;ref name="Couper1837"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Couper | first = J. | title = Sur les effets du peroxide de manganèse | journal =  Journal de chimie médicale, de pharmacie et de toxicologie | year= 1837 | volume = 3 | pages= 223–225  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WpQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Presentation=====
Chronic exposure to excessive Mn levels can lead to a variety of psychiatric and motor disturbances, termed [[manganism]]. Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5&amp;nbsp;mg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms.&lt;ref name="libres.uncg.edu"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06534.x | url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/K_Erickson_Ferroportin_2009.pdf | title = Ferroportin is a manganese-responsive protein that decreases manganese cytotoxicity and accumulation | year = 2010 | last1 = Yin | first1 = Zhaobao | last2 = Jiang | first2 = Haiyan | last3 = Lee | first3 = Eun-Sook Y. | last4 = Ni | first4 = Mingwei | last5 = Erikson | first5 = Keith M. | last6 = Milatovic | first6 = Dejan | last7 = Bowman | first7 = Aaron B. | last8 = Aschner | first8 = Michael | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 112 | issue = 5 | pages = 1190–8 | pmid = 20002294 | pmc = 2819584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In initial stages of manganism, neurological symptoms consist of reduced response speed, irritability, mood changes, and compulsive behaviors.&lt;ref name="pmid16629164"/&gt; Upon protracted exposure symptoms are more prominent and resemble those of [[idiopathic]] [[Parkinson's disease]], as which it is often misdiagnosed, although there are particular differences in both the symptoms (nature of tremors, for example), response to drugs such as [[L-DOPA|levodopa]], and affected portion of the [[basal ganglia]]. Symptoms are also similar to [[Motor neurone disease|Lou Gehrig's disease]] and [[multiple sclerosis]].

=====Causes=====
Manganism has become an active issue in [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] as it has been the subject of numerous [[product liability]] lawsuits against manufacturers of [[arc welding]] supplies. In these lawsuits, welders have accused the manufacturers of failing to provide adequate warning that their products could cause welding fumes to contain dangerously high manganese concentrations that could lead welders to develop manganism. Companies employing welders are also being sued, for what colloquially is known as "welders' disease". However, studies fail to show any link between employment as a welder and manganism (or other neurological problems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fryzek JP, Hansen J, Cohen S, Bonde JP, Llambias MT, Kolstad HA, Skytthe A, Lipworth L, Blot WJ, Olsen JH | date = May 2005 | title = A cohort study of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in Danish welders | url = http://www.weldinginfonetwork.com/studies/05_05_Danish_JOEM.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 5| pages = 466–72 | doi=10.1097/01.jom.0000161730.25913.bf| pmid = 15891525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/oem.2005.022921| pages = 135–40 | title = Parkinson's disease and other basal ganglia or movement disorders in a large nationwide cohort of Swedish welders | year = 2006 | last1 = Fored | first1 = C M | journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pmid = 16421393 | last2 = Fryzek | first2 = JP | last3 = Brandt | first3 = L | last4 = Nise | first4 = G | last5 = Sjögren | first5 = B | last6 = McLaughlin | first6 = JK | last7 = Blot | first7 = WJ | last8 = Ekbom | first8 = A | pmc = 2078076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marsh GM, Gula MJ |date=Oct 2006 | title = Employment as a welder and Parkinson disease among heavy equipment manufacturing workers | url = http://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2006/10000/Employment_as_a_Welder_and_Parkinson_Disease_Among.12.aspx | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 10| pages = 1031–46 | doi=10.1097/01.jom.0000232547.74802.d8|pmid=17033503 |last2=Gula }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pathological mechanisms=====
Manganese may affect [[liver]] function, but the threshold of acute toxicity is very high. On the other hand, more than 95% of manganese is eliminated by biliary excretion. Any existing liver damage may slow this process, increasing its concentration in blood plasma.&lt;ref name="Ballatori2000"&gt;Ballatori N. Molecular mechanisms of hepatic metal transport.

===Vitamin A===
[[Vitamin A]] is an essential [[nutrient]] for mammals which takes form in either [[retinol]] or the [[provitamin]] [[beta-Carotene]]. It helps regulation of cell division, cell function, genetic regulation, helps enhance the immune system, and is required for brain function, chemical balance, growth and development of the [[central nervous system]] and vision.&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3923/ajcn.2009.65.82 |title=Vitamin A: A Review |year=2009 |last1=Edem |first1=D.O. |journal=Asian Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=1 |pages=65–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Learning memory====
In an experiment by [[Chongqing Medical University]] pregnant rats were either plentiful in vitamin A or were of a [[vitamin A deficiency]] (VAD) due to their diet. The offspring of these rats were then tested in a water maze at 8 weeks old and it was found the VAD offspring had a harder time finishing the maze which helps show that these rats, even while having a deficiency from ''[[in utero]]'', have more problems with learning memory.&lt;ref name="Ting-Yu L et.al.

====Spatial memory====
Vitamin A affects spatial memory most of the time because the size of the [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] in hippocampal neurons are reduced by approximately 70% when there is a deficiency which affects a person's abilities for higher cognitive function. In a study by the University of Cagliari, Italy, VAD rats had more trouble learning a [[Radial arm maze]] than rats who had normal levels of the [[vitamin]]. The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15-day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve it. Here it was found that the [[retinoid receptors]] which help transport vitamin A were of normal function.&lt;ref name="Cocco S et.al."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(02)00423-2 |title=Vitamin a deficiency produces spatial learning and memory impairment in rats |year=2002 |last1=Cocco |first1=S |last2=Diaz |first2=G |last3=Stancampiano |first3=R |last4=Diana |first4=A |last5=Carta |first5=M |last6=Curreli |first6=R |last7=Sarais |first7=L |last8=Fadda |first8=F |journal=Neuroscience |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=475–82 |pmid=12421614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention, treatment and symptoms====
Eating foods high in vitamin A or taking [[dietary supplements]], retinol or [[retinal]] will prevent a deficiency. The foods highest in vitamin A are any pigmented fruits and vegetables and leafy green vegetables also provide [[beta-Carotene]].&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"/&gt;
There can be symptoms of fat loss and a reduction of any weight gain that would be considered normal for an individual,&lt;ref name="Cocco S et.al."/&gt; especially developmental weight gains such as in infants which would occur if the infant was deprived of vitamin A [[in utero]] and/or if it was deprived [[postnatal]] for an extensive period of time.&lt;ref name="Ting-Yu L et.al. (Pregnancy)"/&gt; The deficiency can also cause conditions such as [[blindness]] or night blindness, also known as [[nyctalopia]]. Night blindness is due to the inability to regenerate [[rhodopsin]] in the [[Rod cell|rods]] which is needed in dim light in order to see properly.&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"/&gt;
A treatment of supplements of [[retinoic acid]] which is a part of vitamin A can help replenish levels and help bring learning to normal,&lt;ref name="Hermandez-Pinto Puelble-Jimenez and Arilla-Ferreiro"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.04.034 |title= A vitamin A-free diet results in impairment of the rat hippocampal somatostatinergic system |year= 2006 |last1= Hernández-Pinto |first1= A.M. |last2= Puebla-Jiménez |first2= L. |last3= Arilla-Ferreiro |first3= E. |journal= Neuroscience |volume= 141 |issue= 2 |pages= 851–61 |pmid= 16757122}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after 39 weeks this is ineffective even if the treatment is daily because it will not bring the [[retinoid]] hypo-signalling back to normal.&lt;ref name="Etchamendy et.al."/&gt;

====Relationship with zinc====
Zinc is needed to maintain normal vitamin A levels in [[blood plasma]].&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"/&gt; It also helps vitamin A become [[Metabolism|metabolized]] by the [[liver]]. However evidence suggests that when someone is deficient in both vitamin A and zinc, memory is more improved when just vitamin A is increased than when just zinc is increased. Of course [[memory]] has the largest improvement when both are increased. When one of these nutrients is not balanced, the other is most likely to be affected because they rely on each other for proper functioning in learning.&lt;ref name="Kheirvari et al."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3177/jnsv.52.421 |title=Increased Nerve Growth Factor by Zinc Supplementation with Concurrent Vitamin a Deficiency Does Not Improve Memory Performance in Mice |year=2006 |last1=Kheirvari |first1=Sorayya |last2=Uezu |first2=Kayoko |last3=Sakai |first3=Tohru |last4=Nakamori |first4=Masayo |last5=Alizadeh |first5=Mohammad |last6=Sarukura |first6=Nobuko |last7=Yamamoto |first7=Shigeru |journal=Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=421–7 |pmid=17330505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thiamin (vitamin B1)===
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as thiamine, is a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|coenzyme]] essential for the metabolism of [[carbohydrates]].&lt;ref name= delta&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ogershok |first1=Paul R. |last2=Rahman |first2=Aamer |last3=Nestor |first3=Scott |last4=Brick |first4=James |title=Wernicke Encephalopathy in Nonalcoholic Patients |journal=American Journal of the Medical Sciences |pmid=11863078 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0002-9629&amp;volume=323&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=107 |year=2002 |volume=323 |issue=2 |pages=107–11 |doi=10.1097/00000441-200202000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vitamin is important for the facilitation of glucose use, thus ensuring the production of energy for the brain,&lt;ref name="bravo"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17066209 |year=2006 |last1=Bourre |first1=JM |title=Effects of nutrients (in food) on the structure and function of the nervous system: Update on dietary requirements for brain.

The brain retains its thiamine content in the face of a vitamin-deficient diet with great tenacity, as it is the last of all nervous tissues studied to become depleted. A 50% reduction of thiamine stores in [[rat]]s becomes apparent after only 4 days of being put on a thiamine-deficient diet. However, polyneuritic signs do not begin to appear until about 4 or 5 weeks have passed.&lt;ref name="foxtrot"/&gt; Similar results have been found in human subjects.&lt;ref name="echo" /&gt;

====Deficiencies====
The body has only small stores of B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; accordingly, there is risk of deficiency if the level of intake is reduced only for a few weeks.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt; Thiamin deficiency during critical periods of early development can disrupts neurogenesis in animal models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bâ A | year = 2011 | title = Comparative effects of alcohol and thiamine deficiency on the developing central nervous system | url = | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 225 | issue = 1| pages = 235–242 | doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2011.07.015 | pmid=21784107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of thiamin later in life causes the disease known as beriberi.&lt;ref name= golf&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/58-86_150.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was " |page=58 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of [[beriberi]]: "wet", and "dry". Dry beriberi is also known as cerebral beriberi. Characteristics of wet beriberi include prominent [[edema]] and [[Heart|cardiac involvement]], whereas dry beriberi is mainly characterized by a [[Peripheral neuropathy|polyneuritis]].&lt;ref name="foxtrot"/&gt; Severe thiamin deficiency can also result in acute neurodegeneration leading to peripheral neuropathy and memory loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richardson S. |author2=Malhotra A. |author3=Cwynarski K. |author4=Hughes D. |author5=Prentice A. |author6=McNamara C. | year = 2010 | title = Patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy for primary CNS lymphoma should receive prophylactic thiamine to prevent Wernike's encephalopathy | url = | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 149 | issue = 6| pages = 899–901 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08112.x|pmid=20151977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiamine deficiency has been reported in up to 80% of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake, reduced absorption, and impaired utilization of thiamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1983.tb05403.x |title=Alcohol and Thiamine Metabolism |year=1983 |last1=Hoyumpa |first1=Anastacio M. |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=7 |pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol, in combination with its [[metabolite]] [[acetaldehyde]], interacts with thiamine utilization at the molecular level during transport, diphosphorylation, and modification processes. For this reason, chronic alcoholics may have insufficient thiamine for maintenance of normal brain function, even with seemingly adequate dietary intake.&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;

====Symptoms====
Clinical signs of B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency include mental changes such as apathy, decrease in [[short-term memory]], confusion, and irritability.&lt;ref name="golf"/&gt; Moderate deficiency in thiamine may reduce growth in young populations, in increase chronic illness in both young and middle-aged adults. In addition, moderate deficiency of thiamine may increase rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[dementia]], falls, and [[fracture]]s in old age.&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;

The lingering symptoms of neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi are known as [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], or the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff's.&lt;ref name= india&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.42.3.226 |title=Wernicke's encephalopathy: A more common disease than realised.

Korsakoff's syndrome is often characterized by [[confabulation]], disorientation, and profound [[amnesia]].&lt;ref name="india"/&gt; Characteristics of the neuropathology are varied, but generally consist of bilaterally symmetrical midline [[lesion]]s of [[brainstem]] areas, including the [[mammillary bodies]], [[thalamus]], [[Periaqueductal gray|periaqueductal region]], [[hypothalamus]], and the [[cerebellar vermis]].&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="india"/&gt;

====Treatment====
Immediate treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy involves the administration of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] thiamine, followed with long-term treatment and prevention of the disorder through oral thiamine supplements, alcohol [[abstinence]], and a balanced diet.&lt;ref name="delta" /&gt; Improvements in brain functioning of chronic alcoholics may occur with abstinence-related treatment, involving the discontinuation of alcohol consumption and improved nutrition.&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt; Wernicke's encephalopathy is life-threatening if left untreated. However, a rapid reversal of symptoms may result from prompt administration of thiamine.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

====Prevention====
[[Food fortification|Fortification]] of flour is practiced in some countries to replace the thiamine lost during processing. However, this method has been criticized for missing the target population of chronic alcoholics, who are most at risk for deficiency. Alternative solutions have suggested the fortification of alcoholic beverages with thiamine.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

Ingesting a diet rich in thiamine may stave off the adverse effects of deficiency. Foods providing rich sources of thiamine include [[Whole foods|unrefined grain products]], ready-to-eat [[Breakfast cereal|cereals]], meat (especially pork), [[Dairy|dairy products]], peanuts, [[legume]]s, fruits and eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vitamin Basics: The facts about Vitamins in Nutrition |year=2007 |publisher=DSM Nutritional Products Ltd. |location=Germany |isbn= |url=http://www.dsm.com/en_US/downloads/dnp/Vitamin_Basics.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=71 |pages=1–97". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niacin (vitamin B3)===
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as niacin, includes both [[nicotinamide]] as well as [[nicotinic acid]], both of which function in many [[Biological oxidizer|biological oxidization]] and reduction reactions within the body. These functions include the [[Biodegradation|biochemical degradation]] of carbohydrates, [[Lipid|fats]] and [[protein]]s. Niacin is also involved in the synthesis of [[fatty acids]] and [[cholesterol]],&lt;ref name="kilo"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/123-149_150.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=123 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are known mediators of brain biochemistry, and in effect, of cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19990615)56:6&lt;565::AID-JNR2&gt;3.0.CO;2-H |title=Essential fatty acids are mediators of brain biochemistry and cognitive functions |year=1999 |last1=Yehuda |first1=Shlomo |last2=Rabinovitz |first2=Sharon |last3=Mostofsky |first3=David I. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=565–70 |pmid=10374811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufficient niacin intake is either obtained from diet, or synthesized from the [[amino acid]] [[tryptophan]].&lt;ref name="kilo"/&gt;

====Deficiencies====
[[File:Pellagra2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Pellagra initially presents as dermatitis]]
Severe niacin deficiency typically manifests itself as the disease [[pellagra]].&lt;ref name="kilo"/&gt; Synthesis of B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from tryptophan involves [[Riboflavin|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to niacin deficiency. An excess of [[leucine]], an [[essential amino acid]], in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name= lima&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.01959.x |title=Pellagra: Dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea |year=2004 |last1=Hegyi |first1=Juraj |last2=Schwartz |first2=Robert A. |last3=Hegyi |first3=Vladimir |journal=International Journal of Dermatology |volume=43 |pages=1–5 |pmid=14693013 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pellagra is most common to populations within developing countries in which [[corn]] is the dietary [[Staple food|staple]]. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa.&lt;ref name="kilo"/&gt; This is in part due to the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making corn [[tortillas]], can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellagra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake.&lt;ref name= mike&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1041610205001961 |title=Metabolic and endocrinological causes of dementia |year=2005 |last1=Flicker |first1=Leon |last2=Ames |first2=David |journal=International Psychogeriatrics |volume=17 |pages=S79–92 |pmid=16240485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though pellagra predominantly occurs in [[Developing country|developing countries]], sporadic cases of pellagra may be observed within industrialized nations, primarily in chronic alcoholics and patients living with functional absorption complications.&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt;

====Symptoms====
Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 "D's": diarrhea, [[dermatitis]], dementia, and death.&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt; Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, photophobia, tremor, ataxia, spastic paresis, fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalopathy characterized by confusion, memory loss, and psychosis.&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt;

Those afflicted with pellagra may undergo pathological alterations in the nervous system. Findings may include [[Myelin|demylenation]] and degeneration of various affected parts of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral [[nerves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=21433862 |year=1939 |last1=Zimmerman |first1=HM |title=The Pathology of the Nervous System in Vitamin Deficiencies |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–28.7 |pmc=2602501 |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Prognosis of deficiency is excellent with treatment. Without, pellagra will gradually progress and lead to death within 4–5 years, often a result of [[malnutrition]] from prolonged diarrhea, or complications as caused by concurrent infections or neurological symptoms. Symptoms of pellagra can be cured with [[Exogeny|exogenous administration]] of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide.&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt;

[[Flushing (physiology)|Flushing]] occurs in many patients treated therapeutically with nicotinic acid,&lt;ref name="kilo_page_b"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/123-149_150.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=123 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, nicotinamide holds more clinical value as it is not associated with the same uncomfortable flushing. The adult dose of nicotinamide is 100&amp;nbsp;mg taken orally every 6 hours until resolution of major acute symptoms, followed with oral administration of 50&amp;nbsp;mg every 8–12 hours until skin lesions heal. For children, treatment involves oral ingestion of 10–15&amp;nbsp;mg of nicotinamide, depending on weight, every 6 hours until signs and symptoms are resolved. Severe cases require 1&amp;nbsp;gram every 3–4 hours, administered [[parenterally]].&lt;ref name="lima"/&gt;

Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an over-the-counter drug for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's dementia]]. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimer's, vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellagra, but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s007020070011 |title=No evidence for cognitive improvement from oral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in dementia |year=2000 |last1=Rainer |first1=M. |last2=Kraxberger |first2=E. |last3=Haushofer |first3=M. |last4=Mucke |first4=H.

====Prevention====
The best method of prevention is to each food rich in B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Generally, this involves the intake of a protein-rich diet. Foods that contain high concentrations of niacin in the free form include beans and organ meat, as well as enriched grain and cereal products.&lt;ref name="kilo"/&gt; While niacin is present in corn and other grains, the [[bioavailability]] of the nutrient is much less than it is in protein-rich sources. Different methods of processing corn may result in a higher degree of bioavailability of the vitamin.&lt;ref name="mike"/&gt;

Though treatment with niacin does little to alter the effects of Alzheimer's dementia, niacin intake from foods is inversely associated with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.025858 |title=Dietary niacin and the risk of incident Alzheimer's disease and of cognitive decline |year=2004 |last1=Morris |first1=M C |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=8 |pages=1093–1099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folate (vitamin B9)===

However the European Union does not have mandatory folic acid fortification. Although the protective effects of folic acid are well documented, there remains legitimate concern that fortification could lead to toxic levels in a subset of the population. For example, elevated levels of folic acid can interact with vitamin B12 deficiency to cause neurodegeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blasko I. |author2=Hinterberger M. |author3=Kemmler G. |author4=Jungwirth S. |author5=Krampla W. |author6=Leitha T. |author7=Fischer P. | year = 2012 | title = Conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia: influence of folic acid and vitamin B12 use in the VITA cohort | url = | journal = The Journal of Nutrition, Health &amp; Aging | volume = 16 | issue = 8| pages = 687–694 | doi=10.1007/s12603-012-0051-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, folic acid and iron can interact to exacerbate malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Titaley C.

Folic acid is the most oxidized and stable form of folate, and can also be referred to as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;. It rarely occurs naturally in foods, but it is the form used in vitamin supplements as well as fortified food products.&lt;ref name="november"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/196-305_150.pdf  |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=196 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folate coenzymes are involved in numerous conversion processes within the body, including DNA synthesis and amino acid interconversions.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; play a vital role in the synthesis of [[S-Adenosyl methionine|S-adenosylmethionine]], which is of key importance in the maintenance and repairment of all cells, including neurons.&lt;ref name="oscar p230-5"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1865312 |year=1991 |last1=Hauck |first1=MR |title=Cognitive abilities of preschool children: Implications for nurses working with young children |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=230–5 |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt;

Folate has a major, but indirect role in activities which help to direct gene expression and [[Cell growth|cell proliferation]]. These activities occur at a greatly increased rate during [[pregnancy]], and depend on adequate levels of folate within [[blood plasma]].&lt;ref name= papa&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11475447 |year=2001 |last1=Moyers |first1=S |last2=Bailey |first2=LB |title=Fetal malformations and folate metabolism: Review of recent evidence |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=215–24 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb07013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrations of blood plasma folate and [[homocysteine]] concentrations are inversely related, such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration. Thus, dietary intake of folate is a major determinant of homocysteine levels within the body.&lt;ref name= quebec&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=16210710 |year=2005 |author1=Homocysteine Lowering Trialists' Collaboration |title=Dose-dependent effects of folic acid on blood concentrations of homocysteine: A meta-analysis of the randomized trials |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=806–12 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autoantibodies]] against [[folate receptor alpha]] have been found in up to 75% of children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frye|first=R. E.|last2=Sequeira|first2=J.

====Deficiencies====
Folate deficiency most commonly arises from insufficient folate intake from the diet, but may also stem from inefficient absorption or metabolic utilization of folate, usually a result of genetic variation.&lt;ref name= zulu&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004514 |chapter=Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for cognition and dementia |title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2003 |last1=Malouf |first1=R|authorlink2=John Grimley Evans |last2=Grimley Evans |first2=J |last3=Areosa Sastre |first3=A |editor1-last=Malouf |editor1-first=Reem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between folate and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in [[megaloblastic anemia]], characterized by organic mental change.&lt;ref name= romeo&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9155210 |year=1996 |last1=Bottiglieri |first1=T |title=Folate, vitamin B12, and neuropsychiatric disorders |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=382–90 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1996.tb03851.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of neural tube transformation into structures that will eventually develop into the central nervous system is known as [[neurulation]], the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body. This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after [[fertilisation|conception]], and is completed by 28 days. Thus, a woman may not even be aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete, potentially causing severe consequences in the development of the fetus.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt;

Functional problems in the absorption and utilization of vitamins may also play a role in folate deficiencies within the elderly.&lt;ref name="oscar p230-5" /&gt;

====Symptoms====
[[File:Anencephaly side.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Anencephaly is the most common presentation of neural tube defects&lt;ref name="dingus"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199911113412006 |title=Neural-Tube Defects |year=1999 |last1=Botto |first1=Lorenzo D. |last2=Moore |first2=Cynthia A. |last3=Khoury |first3=Muin J. |last4=Erickson |first4=J.

The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large, but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood,&lt;ref name="quebec"/&gt; as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, and to a lesser extent, vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Elevated homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of [[Stroke|vascular events]], as well as dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=15213037 |year=2004 |last1=Quadri |first1=P |last2=Fragiacomo |first2=C |last3=Pezzati |first3=R |last4=Zanda |first4=E |last5=Forloni |first5=G |last6=Tettamanti |first6=M |last7=Lucca |first7=U |title=Homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B-12 in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=114–22 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6247.1036 |title=The neuropsychiatry of megaloblastic anaemia |year=1980 |last1=Shorvon |first1=S D |last2=Carney |first2=M W |last3=Chanarin |first3=I |last4=Reynolds |first4=E H |journal=BMJ |volume=281 |issue=6247 |pages=1036–8 |pmid=6253016 |pmc=1714413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt; In one study, mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard [[Antidepressant|antidepressant therapy]] than did those with normal levels within plasma.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; However, replication of these findings are less robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12042457 |year=2002 |last1=Bryan |first1=J |last2=Calvaresi |first2=E |last3=Hughes |first3=D |title=Short-term folate, vitamin B-12 or vitamin B-6 supplementation slightly affects memory performance but not mood in women of various ages |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=1345–56 |journal=The Journal of Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of folic acid during pregnancy is vital to normal development of the nervous system in the fetus. A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in [[Neural tube defects|neural tube disorder]], a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely.&lt;ref name="papa"/&gt; NTDs are not to be confused with [[spina bifida]], which does not involve neural elements.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube. The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes [[encephalocele]], craniorachischisis, and [[anencephaly]]. In addition, these defects can also be classified as open, if neural tissue is exposed or covered only by membrane, or can be classified as closed, if the tissue is covered by normal skin.&lt;ref name="dingus"/&gt;

Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in [[learning]] and memory, particularly within the elderly population.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition, which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.11.3.487 |title=Effects of serum vitamin B-sub-1-sub-2 and folate status on episodic memory performance in very old age: A population-based study |year=1996 |last1=Wahlin |first1=Åke |last2=Hill |first2=Robert D. |last3=Winblad |first3=Bengt |last4=Bäckman |first4=Lars |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=487–96 |pmid=8893317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] speed were observed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60109-3 |title=Effect of 3-year folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in older adults in the FACIT trial: A randomised, double blind, controlled trial |year=2007 |last1=Durga |first1=Jane |last2=Van Boxtel |first2=Martin PJ |last3=Schouten |first3=Evert G |last4=Kok |first4=Frans J |last5=Jolles |first5=Jelle |last6=Katan |first6=Martijn B |last7=Verhoef |first7=Petra |journal=The Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=208–216 |pmid=17240287}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance.

However, while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency, the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency. This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels of folate, as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect.&lt;ref name="oscar p1-13"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18653121 |year=1998 |last1=Fioravanti |first1=M |last2=Ferrario |first2=E |last3=Massaia |first3=M |last4=Cappa |first4=G |last5=Rivolta |first5=G |last6=Grossi |first6=E |last7=Buckley |first7=AE |title=Low folate levels in the cognitive decline of elderly patients and the efficacy of folate as a treatment for improving memory deficits |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |doi=10.1016/s0167-4943(97)00028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention====
Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized, it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400μg of folic acid from fortified foods, supplements, or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85% with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="papa"/&gt;

The incidence of Alzheimer's and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate. It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food, fortified or not, and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease.&lt;ref name="oscar p1-13"/&gt;
Good sources of folate include [[Liver (food)|liver]], ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, beans, asparagus, spinach, broccoli, and orange juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2773830 |year=1989 |last1=Subar |first1=AF |last2=Block |first2=G |last3=James |first3=LD |title=Folate intake and food sources in the US population |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=508–16 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choline===
Choline is an important methyl donor involved in one-carbon metabolism that also becomes incorporated into phospholipids and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Because of its role in cellular synthesis, choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain.  A study found that rats that were given supplements of choline in utero or in the weeks following birth had superior memories. The changes appeared to be a result of physical changes to the [[hippocampus]], the area of the brain responsible for memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15640516 |year=2004 |last1=Zeisel |first1=SH |title=Nutritional importance of choline for brain development |volume=23 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=621S–626S |journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition |doi=10.1080/07315724.2004.10719433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zeisel S. H. | year = 2006 | title = The fetal origins of memory: the role of dietary choline in optimal brain development | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 149 | issue = 5| pages = S131–S136 | doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.06.065 | pmid=17212955 | pmc=2430654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, choline can reduce some of the deleterious effects of folate deficiency on neurogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Craciunescu C. N. |author2=Johnson A. R. |author3=Zeisel S. H. | year = 2010 | title = Dietary choline reverses some, but not all, effects of folate deficiency on neurogenesis and apoptosis in fetal mouse brain | url = | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 140 | issue = 6| pages = 1162–1166 | doi=10.3945/jn.110.122044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While choline during development is important, adult levels of choline are also important.  Choline has been shown to increase the synthesis and release of acetylcholine from neurons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.6867732 |title=Choline and cholinergic neurons |year=1983 |last1=Blusztajn |first1=J. |last2=Wurtman |first2=R. |journal=Science |volume=221 |issue=4611 |pages=614–20 |pmid=6867732|bibcode=1983Sci...221..614B }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn increases memory.  A [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind study]] was conducted using normal college students (no neurological disorders).  Results showed that twenty-five [[gram]]s of [[phosphatidylcholine]] (another form of choline) created a significant improvement in [[explicit memory]], measured by a [[Serial learning|serial learning task]], however this improvement may be attributed to the improvement of slow learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00002826-199312000-00007 |title=Brief Report |year=1993 |last1=Ladd |first1=Sandra L. |last2=Sommer |first2=Susan A. |last3=Laberge |first3=Stephen |last4=Toscano |first4=William |journal=Clinical Neuropharmacology |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=540–9 |pmid=9377589}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found that a single ten-gram oral dose of choline, given to normal volunteers (again, without neurological disorders) significantly decreased the number of trials needed to master a serial-learning word test.  This increase in memory is particularly beneficial to memory loss suffered by old age.  A study conducted on rats who, like humans, suffer from an age-related loss of memory were tested on how choline affected memory.  The results showed that rats who had a chronic low-choline diet showed greater memory loss then their same-age control counterparts, while rats who had choline-enriched diets showed a diminished memory loss compared to both the choline-low diet and control rat groups.  Furthermore, young rats who were choline-deficient performed as poorly on memory tasks as older rats while older rats that were given choline supplements performed as well as three-month-old rats.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111156 |title=Choline: Critical Role During Fetal Development and Dietary Requirements in Adults |year=2006 |last1=Zeisel |first1=Steven H. |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=26 |pages=229–50 |pmid=16848706 |pmc=2441939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deficiencies and treatments====
Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in, studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men, women and children are below the [[Adequate Intake]] levels.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00246.x |title=Choline: An essential nutrient for public health |year=2009 |last1=Zeisel |first1=Steven H |last2=Da Costa |first2=Kerry-Ann |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=615–23 |pmid=19906248 |pmc=2782876}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that not enough choline is naturally produced by the body, so diet is an important factor.  People who consume a large quantity of alcohol may be at an increased risk for choline deficiency.  [[Sex]] and age also plays a role, with [[Premenopause|premenopausal]] females being less sensitive to choline deficiency than either males or [[Postmenopause|postmenopausal]] females.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH"/&gt;  This has been theorized to be a result of premenopausal women having an increased ability to synthesize choline in some form, which has been confirmed in studies on rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M301982200 |title=A Gender-specific Role for Phosphatidylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase-derived Phosphatidylcholine in the Regulation of Plasma High Density and Very Low Density Lipoproteins in Mice |year=2003 |last1=Noga |first1=A.

Slightly improvements were shown in memory tests compared to the placebo control group.  It should be noted however that other studies conducted did not find any such improvement.

===Cobalamin (vitamin B12)===
Also known as cobalamin, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is an essential vitamin necessary for normal [[Hematopoiesis|blood formation]]. It is also important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health.&lt;ref name= sierra&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/306-356_150.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=306 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; into the body requires adequate amounts of [[intrinsic factor]], the [[glycoprotein]] produced in the [[parietal cells]] of the stomach lining. A functioning [[small intestine]] is also necessary for the proper metabolism of the vitamin, as absorption occurs within the [[ileum]].&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt;

B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is produced in the digestive tracts of all animals, including humans.&lt;ref name= tango&gt;{{cite book |title=Vitamin Basics: The facts about Vitamins in Nutrition |year=2007 |publisher=DSM Nutritional Products |url=http://www.dsm.com/en_US/downloads/dnp/Vitamin_Basics.pdf |accessdate=2012}}{{page needed|was "|page=65 |pages=1–97". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, animal-origin food is the only natural food source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name= uniform&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.357 |title=Vitamin B12 Deficiency in the Elderly |year=1999 |last1=Baik |first1=H.W. |last2=Russell |first2=R.M. |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=19 |pages=357–77 |pmid=10448529}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, synthesis of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in the [[large intestine]], which is past the point of absorption that occurs within the small intestine. As such, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; must be obtained through diet.&lt;ref name="tango"/&gt;

====Deficiencies====
Unlike other B vitamins which are not stored in the body, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is stored in the [[liver]]. Because of this, it may take 5–10 years before a sudden dietary B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency will become apparent in a previously healthy adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.1999.00616.x |title=Atrophic gastritis during long-term omeprazole therapy affects serum vitamin B12 levels |year=1999 |last1=Schenk |last2=Kuipers |last3=Klinkenberg-Knol |last4=Bloemena |last5=Sandell |last6=Nelis |last7=Snel |last8=Festen |last9=Meuwissen |journal=Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1343–6 |pmid=10540050 |first1=BE |first2=EJ |first3=EC |first4=EC |first5=M |first6=GF |first7=P |first8=HP |first9=SG  }}&lt;/ref&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency, also known as hypocobalaminemia, often results from complications involving absorption into the body.&lt;ref name= victor&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17043022 |year=2006 |last1=Hvas |first1=AM |last2=Nexo |first2=E |title=Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency--an update |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1506–12 |journal=Haematologica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is often associated with [[pernicious anemia]], as it is the most common cause. Pernicious anemia results from an [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune disorder]] which destroys the cells that produce [[intrinsic factor]] within the stomach lining, thereby hindering B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; absorption. B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron, thus, people with pernicious anemia often present with typical symptoms of [[anemia]], such as pale skin, dizziness, and fatigue.&lt;ref name= whiskey&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199711133372007 |title=Pernicious Anemia |year=1997 |last1=Epstein |first1=Franklin H. |last2=Toh |first2=Ban-Hock |last3=Van Driel |first3=Ian R. |last4=Gleeson |first4=Paul A. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=337 |issue=20 |pages=1441–8 |pmid=9358143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those at highest risk for B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency are the elderly population, as 10-15% of people aged 60+ may present with some form of hypocobalaminemia. High rates of deficiency in the elderly commonly results from the decrease of functional absorption of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, as production of intrinsic factor declines with age. However, pernicious anemia is the most common cause of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency in North American and European populations.&lt;ref name="uniform"/&gt;

Those afflicted with various [[Digestive disease|gastrointestinal diseases]] may also be at risk for deficiency as a result of malabsorption. These diseases may affect production of intrinsic factor in the stomach, or of pancreatic [[bile]]. Diseases that involve disorders of the small intestine, such as celiac disease, [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ileitis]], may also reduce B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; absorption. For example, people with celiac disease may damage the microvilli within their small intestines through the consumption of gluten, thereby inhibiting absorption of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; as well as other nutrients.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt;

A diet low in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, whether voluntary or not, can also cause symptoms of hypocobalaminemia. Many rich sources of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; come from animal meats and by-products. Populations in developing countries may not have access to these foods on a consistent basis, and as a result may become deficient in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name= xray&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.24.012003.132440 |title=Vitamin B12 Deficiency As a Worldwide Problem |year=2004 |last1=Stabler |first1=Sally P. |last2=Allen |first2=Robert H. |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=24 |pages=299–326 |pmid=15189123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Veganism|vegans]], and to a lesser extent [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|vegetarians]], are at risk for consuming a diet low in cobalamin as they voluntarily abstain from animal sources of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; A combination of these two scenarios may increase prevalence of cobalamin deficit. For instance, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is problematic in India, where the majority of the population is vegetarian and the scarcity of meat consumption is common for omnivores as well.&lt;ref name="xray"/&gt;

====Symptoms====
An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 75-90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, optic nerves, and [[cerebrum]]. These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of [[myelin]],&lt;ref name= yankee&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5006.1394 |title=Cerebral Manifestations of Vitamin-B12 Deficiency |year=1956 |last1=Holmes |first1=J. M. |journal=BMJ |volume=2 |issue=5006 |pages=1394–8 |pmid=13374343 |pmc=2035923}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be expressed behaviourally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities, or motor disturbances, such as gait ataxia. Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes.&lt;ref name="uniform"/&gt; Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of [[Mental confusion|confusion]], severe agitation and depression, [[delusions]] and paranoid behaviour, visual and auditory [[hallucinations]], [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]] in the absence of overt spinal lesions, dysphasia, violent maniacal behaviour, and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency.&lt;ref name="yankee"/&gt; All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes.&lt;ref name="uniform"/&gt;

Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show symptoms of bleeding [[gums]], [[headache]], poor [[Attentional control|concentration]], shortness of breath, and weakness. In severe cases of pernicious anemia, individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia, and memory loss.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

It is not always easy to determine whether B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is present, especially within older adults.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that may be attributed to normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well.&lt;ref name="uniform"/&gt; Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

====Treatment====
[[File:B vitamin supplement tablets.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Individuals with absorption disorders, or those who abstain from animal products should supplement their diet with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; regularly]]
Patients deficient in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6&amp;nbsp;mg of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000&amp;nbsp;mg of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; administered [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly for the rest of the patient's life. Daily oral supplementation of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; mega-doses may be sufficient in reliable patients, but it is imperative that the supplementation be continued on a lifelong basis as relapse may occur otherwise.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual. As a result, early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur.&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt; Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

A deficiency in folate may produce anemia similar to the anemia resulting from B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency.&lt;ref name="zulu"/&gt;

====Prevention====
In addition to meeting intake requirements through food consumption, supplementation of diet with vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is seen as a viable preventative measure for deficiency. It has been recommended for the elderly to supplement 50&amp;nbsp;mcg a day in order to prevent deficit from occurring.&lt;ref name="whiskey"/&gt;

Animal protein products are a good source of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, particularly organ meats such as [[Kidney (food)|kidney]] or liver. Other good sources are fish, eggs, and dairy products.&lt;ref name="tango"/&gt; It is suggested that vegans, who consume no animal meat or by-products, supplement their diet with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. While there are foods fortified with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; available, some may be mislabelled in an attempt to boost their nutritional claims. Products of fermentation, such as algae extracts and sea vegetables, may be labelled as sources of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, but actually contain B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; [[Structural analog|analogues]] which compete for the absorption of the nutrient itself.&lt;ref name="xray" /&gt; In order to get adequate amounts of the vitamin, orally administered pills or fortified foods such as cereals and soy milk, are recommended for vegans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1079/BJN19780089 |title=Haematological studies on vegans |year=2007 |last1=Sanders |first1=T.

===Vitamin D===
Vitamin D is an essential regulator of the vitamin D receptor that controls gene transcription during development. The vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in the substantia nigra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eyles D. W. |author2=Smith S. |author3=Kinobe R. |author4=Hewison M. |author5=McGrath J.

==Lipids==
===Fat===
Fatty acids are necessary for the synthesis of cell membranes neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. While excessive fat intake can be harmful, deficiency of essential fatty acids can disrupt neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity.&lt;ref name="Lafourcade, M. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lafourcade M. |author2=Larrieu T. |author3=Mato S. |author4=Duffaud A. |author5=Sepers M. |author6=Matias I. |author7=Manzoni O. J. | year = 2011 | title = Nutritional omega-3 deficiency abolishes endocannabinoid-mediated neuronal functions | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 345–350 | doi=10.1038/nn.2736 | pmid=21278728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saturated fat====
Consuming large amounts of saturated fat can negatively affect the  brain.  Eating foods with saturated fats elevates the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the body.  Studies have shown that high levels of triglycerides strongly link with mood problems such as depression, hostility and aggression.  This may occur because high triglyceride levels decrease the amount of oxygen that blood can carry to the  brain.&lt;ref name="psych"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blaun|first=Randy|author2=Andreas Wiesenack |title=How to Eat Smart|journal=Psychology Today|year=1996|volume=29|issue=3|pages=34|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200301/brain-power-why-proteins-are-smart|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Heart Association recommends that people consume no more than 16g of saturated fat daily.  Common sources of saturated fat are meat and dairy products.

====Essential fatty acids====
There are two kinds of essential fatty acids that people must consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Many academics recommend a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice.&lt;ref name="Lafourcade, M. 2011"/&gt; [[Omega-3 fatty acid#Dietary sources|Sources of omega-3]] include flax seeds, chia seeds, walnuts, sea vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and cold water fish.  Sources of omega-6 include walnuts, hazelnuts; sunflower, safflower, corn, and sesame oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Brain-Fats|url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/fats.html|work=The Franklin Institute Online|accessdate=12 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526131629/http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/fats.html#|archive-date=26 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cholesterol===
While cholesterol is essential for membranes and steroid hormones, excess cholesterol affects blood flow impairing cognitive function in vascular dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moser D. J. |author2=Boles Ponto L. L. |author3=Miller I. N. |author4=Schultz S. K. |author5=Menda Y. |author6=Arndt S. |author7=Nopoulos P.

==Carbohydrates==
Studies have shown that learning and memory improve after consuming carbohydrates. There are two kinds of carbohydrates people consume: simple and complex.  Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods and release sugar into the bloodstream quickly after consumption.  Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and therefore cause sugar to be released into the bloodstream more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Brain-Carbohydrates|url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/carbs.html|work=The Franklin Institute Online|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Good sources of complex carbohydrates are whole-grain breads, pasta, brown rice, oatmeal, and potatoes.  It is recommended that people consume more complex carbohydrates because consuming complex carbohydrates will cause the level of sugar in the bloodstream to be more stable, which will cause less stress hormones to be released.  Consuming simple carbohydrates may cause the levels of sugar in the bloodstream to rise and fall, which can cause mood swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brain Foods|url=http://www.askdrsears.com/html/4/t040400.asp|work=Dr. Sears Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low carbohydrate ketogenic diets===
The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate is a fuel source for the brain during times of fasting when blood glucose levels fall. Although the mechanism is not understood, it is well established that eating a diet low in carbohydrates can be therapeutic for children with epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Neal E. G. |author2=Chaffe H. |author3=Schwartz R. H. |author4=Lawson M. S. |author5=Edwards N. |author6=Fitzsimmons G. |author7=Cross J.

Furthermore, a ketogenic diet can be beneficial for dementia patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Henderson S. T. | year = 2008 | title = Ketone bodies as a therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 470–480 | doi=10.1016/j.nurt.2008.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medium-chain triglyceride]]s can stimulate ketone synthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yeh Y.

==Protein==
When protein is consumed, it is broken down into amino acids.  These amino acids are used to produce many things like neurotransmitters, enzymes, hormones, and chromosomes.  Proteins known as complete proteins contain all eight of the essential amino acids. Meat, cheese, eggs, and yogurt are all examples of complete proteins.  Incomplete proteins contain only some of the eight essential amino acids and it is recommended that people consume a combination of these proteins.  Examples of incomplete proteins include nuts, seeds, legumes, and grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Brain-Protein|url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/proteins.html|work=The Franklin Institute Online|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When animals are fed a diet deficient in essential amino acids, uncharged tRNAs accumulate in the anterior piriform cortex signaling diet rejection [105]. The body normally interconverts amino acids to maintain homeostasis, but muscle protein can be catabolized to release amino acids during conditions of amino acid deficiency. Disruption of amino acid metabolism can affect brain development and neurophysiology to affect behavior. For example, fetal protein deficiency decreases the number of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lister J. P., Blatt G. J., DeBassio W. A., Kemper T. L., Tonkiss J., Galler J. R., Rosene D.

===Glutamate===
[[Glutamate]] is a [[proteinogenic amino acid]] and neurotransmitter, though it is perhaps publicly best known in its [[sodium]] [[salt]] form: [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).  It is also a [[Glutamic acid (flavor)|flavor]] on its own, producing the [[umami]] or savory flavor found in many [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] foods such as [[cheese]].  As an amino acid it acts as a source of fuel for various cellular functions and as a neurotransmitter. Glutamate operates as an [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] and is released when a nerve impulse excites a glutamate producing cell.  This in turn binds to neurons with glutamate receptors, stimulating them.

====Deficiencies and treatments====
Glutamate is a nutrient that is extremely difficult to be deficient in, as, being an amino acid, it is found in every food that contains protein.  Additionally it is found, as previously mentioned, in fermented foods and in foods containing monosodium glutamate.  As such, good sources of glutamate include meat, fish, dairy products and a [[Glutamic acid (flavor)#Concentration in foods|wide array]] of other foods.  Glutamate is also absorbed extremely efficiently by the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Peter J. |last1=Reeds |first2=Douglas G. |last2=Burrin |first3=Barbara |last3=Stoll |first4=Farook |last4=Jahoor |title=Intestinal Glutamate Metabolism |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |pmid=10736365 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10736365 |year=2000 |volume=130 |issue=4S Suppl |pages=978S–82S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are instances of glutamate deficiency occurring, but only in cases where genetic disorders are present.  One such example is ''Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency'' and can cause either minor or profound physical and intellectual disabilities, depending on the severity of the condition.  This disorder is extremely rare however, as only twenty people have so far been identified with this condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/glutamate-formiminotransferase-deficiency{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glutamate, while critically important in the body also acts as an [[Excitotoxicity|excitotoxin]] in high concentrations not normally found outside of laboratory conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0896-6273(95)90186-8 |title=Glutamate-induced neuronal death: A succession of necrosis or apoptosis depending on mitochondrial function |year=1995 |last1=Ankarcrona |first1=Maria |last2=Dypbukt |first2=Jeannette M. |last3=Bonfoco |first3=Emanuela |last4=Zhivotovsky |first4=Boris |last5=Orrenius |first5=Sten |last6=Lipton |first6=Stuart A. |last7=Nicotera |first7=Pierluigi |journal=Neuron |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=961–73 |pmid=7576644}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can occur following [[brain injury]] or [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.12.010 |title=Mechanisms of chronic central neuropathic ''pain after'' spinal cord injury |year=2009 |last1=Hulsebosch |first1=Claire E. |last2=Hains |first2=Bryan C. |last3=Crown |first3=Eric D. |last4=Carlton |first4=Susan M. |journal=Brain Research Reviews |volume=60 |pages=202–13 |pmid=19154757 |issue=1 |pmc=2796975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phenylalanine===
L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids, and beta-[[phenethylamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broadley|first=KJ|title=The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines.|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=March 2010|volume=125|issue=3|pages=363–75|pmid=19948186|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenethylamine is further converted into N-methylphenethylamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pendleton|first=RG|author2=Gessner, G |author3=Sawyer, J |title=Studies on lung N-methyltransferases, a pharmacological approach.|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|date=September 1980|volume=313|issue=3|pages=263–8|pmid=7432557|doi=10.1007/BF00505743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier, and, in large quantities, interferes with the production of serotonin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pascucci T., Ventura R., Puglisi-Allegra S., Cabib S. | year = 2002 | title = Deficits in brain serotonin synthesis in a genetic mouse model of phenylketonuria | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 13 | issue = 18| pages = 2561–2564 | pmid = 12499868 | last2 = Ventura | last3 = Puglisi-Allegra | last4 = Cabib | doi =  10.1097/00001756-200212200-00036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phenylketonuria====
Toxic levels of phenylalanine accumulate in the brains of patients with [[phenylketonuria]] leading to severe brain damage and mental retardation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31868">An '''orphan drug''' is a [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]] that has been developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as an [[orphan disease]].

The assignment of '''orphan status''' to a disease and to any drugs developed to treat it is a matter of [[public policy (law)|public policy]] in many countries and has resulted in medical breakthroughs that may not have otherwise been achieved due to the economics of drug [[medical research|research and development]].&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

In the US and the EU, it is easier to gain marketing approval for an orphan drug, and there may be other financial incentives, such as an extended period of exclusivity, a time during which that company is the only one allowed to market the orphan drug—all intended to encourage the development of those drugs which might otherwise lack a sufficient [[profit motive]] and market to attract companies' research budgets and personnel.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=http://info.evaluategroup.com/rs/evaluatepharmaltd/images/2014OD.pdf |format=PDF |first=Andreas |last=Hadjivasiliou|title=Orphan Drug Report 2014 |date=October 2014 |work=EvaluatePharma |accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly_2002" /&gt;

==Definition==
An orphan drug is a [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]] which has been developed to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as a [[rare disease]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A rare disease, also referred to as an "orphan disease", is any disease which affects a small percentage of the population. Most rare diseases are genetic, and thus are present throughout the person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30 percent of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203212325/http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No single cutoff number has been agreed upon for which a disease is considered rare.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A disease may be considered rare in one part of the world, or in a particular group of people, but still be common in another.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} As many as one-in-ten Americans suffers from rare disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rare diseases' troubling questions |author=Andrew Duffy|newspaper=Cobourg Daily Star (Ontario) |date=25 January 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global statistics==
{{as of|2014}}, there were 281 marketed orphan drugs and more than 400 orphan designated drugs in clinical trials. More than 60% of orphan drugs were biologics. The US dominated the development of orphan drugs with more than 300 orphan drugs in clinical trial process, followed by Europe. [[Cancer treatment]] was the indication in more than 30% for orphan drug clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Kuick_2014"&gt;{{citation| title=Global orphan drug market to reach US$ 120 billion by 2018|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-orphan-drug-market-to-reach-us-120-billion-by-2018-244195511.html|accessdate=20 March 2014|publisher=Kuick Research|date=7 Feb 2014 |location=New Delhi|format=press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on investment, sales and profit==
According to [[Thomson Reuters]] in their 2012 publication "The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs," there has been increased investing in orphan drug research and development partly due to the U. S. [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]] (ODA) and similar acts in other regions of the world and also driven by "high-profile philanthropic funding."&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs |work=Thomson Reuters |year=2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |authors=Laura Gaze, Jennifer Breen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513083426/http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.drugdiscoverytoday.com/download/900 |title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |authors=Kiran N. Meeking, Cory S.M. Williams, John E. Arrowsmith |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.02.005 |volume=17 |journal=Drug Discovery Today |pages=660–664 |pmid=22366309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the trade journal [[Drug Discovery Today]] between 2001 and 2011 was the "most productive period in the history of orphan drug development, in terms of average annual orphan drug designations and orphan drug approvals."&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012" /&gt;{{rp|660}} For the same decade the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of the orphan drugs was an "impressive 25.8 percent, compared to only 20.1 percent for a matched control group of non-orphan drugs."&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}} 
By 2012, the market for orphan drugs was worth USD$637 million compared to the USD$638 million matched control group of non-orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012" /&gt;

By 2012,

{{quote|"the revenue-generating potential of orphan drugs [was] as great as for non-orphan drugs, even though patient populations for rare diseases are significantly smaller. Moreover, we suggest that orphan drugs have greater profitability when considered in the full context of developmental drivers including government financial incentives, smaller clinical trial sizes, shorter clinical trial times and higher rates of regulatory success."|Gaze and Breen 2012}}

According to a 2014 report, the orphan drug market has become increasingly lucrative for a number of reasons: The cost of clinical trials for orphan drugs is substantially lower than for other diseases —trial sizes are naturally much smaller than for more common diseases with larger numbers of patients. Small clinical trials and little competition place orphan agents at an advantage in regulatory review.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"/&gt;

Tax incentives reduce the cost of development. On average the cost per patient for orphan drugs is "six times that of non-orphan drugs, a clear indication of their pricing power". The cost of per-person outlays are huge and are expected to increase with wider use of public subsidies.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

The 2014 Orphan Drug report stated that the percentage of orphan drug sales as part of all prescription drug sales had been increasing at rapid rate. By 2020 the total was predicted to be $176 billion.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt; Although orphan disease populations are the smallest, the cost of per-patient outlays have been the largest. There pressure on pharmaceuticals which "represent the biggest budgetary drain" has been predicted to increase particularly as more people with rare diseases will be eligible for subsidies —in the United States for example through the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

==Legislation==
Orphan drugs generally follow the same regulatory development path as any other pharmaceutical product, in which testing focuses on [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]], [[dosing]], stability, safety and efficacy. However, some statistical burdens are lessened to maintain development momentum. For example, orphan drug regulations generally acknowledge the fact that it may not be possible to test 1,000 patients in a [[clinical trial|phase III clinical trial]], as fewer than that number may be afflicted with the disease in question.

Since the market for any drug with such a limited application scope would, by definition, be small and thus largely unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies, some governments have chosen to intervene to motivate a manufacturer to develop an orphan drug.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

The intervention by government on behalf of orphan drug development can take a variety of forms:
* [[Tax incentive]]s
* Exclusivity (enhanced patent protection and marketing rights)
* Financial research subsidies
* Creating a government-run enterprise to engage in research and development as in a [[Crown corporation]]

A 2015 study of "34 key Canadian stakeholders including drug regulators, funders, scientists, policy experts, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and patient advocates"  investigated contributing factors to the growing interest of the pharmaceutical industry in "niche markets" such as orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="World_Medicine_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=World Medicine Health Policy |date= 19 March 2015 |volume=7 |number=1 |pages= 3–27 |doi=10.1002/wmh3.131 |title=Why the Shift?

===United States===

The [[Orphan Drug Act]] (ODA) of January 1983, passed in the [[United States]], with lobbying from the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] and many other organizations,&lt;ref name=henkel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/1999/399_orph.html | last=Henkel | first=John | title=Orphan Drug Law Matures into Medical Mainstay | year=1999 | work=[[FDA Consumer]] | publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to encourage [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] to develop drugs for diseases that have a small market.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C0CE4DF1F3EF933A05757C0A966958260 | title=Orphan Drug Law Spurs Debate | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=15 February 2009 | last=Pollack | first=Andrew | date=30 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ODA drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic agents would qualify for orphan status if they were intended to treat a disease affecting less than 200,000 American citizens. Under the ODA orphan drug sponsors qualify for seven-year FDA-administered market Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE), "tax credits of up to 50% of R&amp;D costs, R&amp;D grants, waived FDA fees, protocol assistance&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"/&gt;{{rp|660}} and may get clinical trial [[tax incentive]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Orphan drug designation means that the sponsor qualifies for certain benefits but it does not mean the drug is safe and effective and legal to manufacture and market in the United States.

In 2002, the [[Rare Diseases Act of 2002|Rare Diseases Act]] was signed into law. It amended the [[Public Health Service Act]] to establish the [[Office of Rare Diseases]]. It also increased funding for the development of treatments for people with [[rare diseases]].&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt;

===European Union===
In 2000, the [[European Union]] (EU) has enacted similar legislation, Regulation(EC) No 141/2000, which refers to drugs developed to treat rare diseases to as "orphan medicinal products". The EU's definition of an orphan condition is broader than that of the USA, in that it also covers some tropical diseases that are primarily found in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11418 |title=Orphan disease definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2002-08-25 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan drug status granted by the European Commission gives marketing exclusivity in the EU for 10 years after approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerke|first=Sara|last2=Pattinson|first2=Shaun D.|date=2017-02-09|title=EU Marketing Authorisation of Orphan Medicinal Products and Its Impact on Related Research|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718093-12341439|journal=Brill|doi=10.1163/15718093-12341439|volume=24|pages=541–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's legislation is administered by the [[Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products]] of the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA).

In late 2007 the FDA and EMA agreed to use a common application process for both agencies to make it easier for manufacturers to apply for orphan drug status but, while continuing two separate approval processes.&lt;ref name="BWN112007"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Legislation has been implemented by Japan, Singapore, and Australia that offers subsidies and other incentives to encourage the development of drugs that treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref name="Windsor"&gt;{{cite news |title=ORPHAN DISEASES A RARE OCCURRENCE: A desperate search for help; County family joins long list with rare diseases in seeking a miracle |author=Andrew Duffy |newspaper=Windsor Star (Ontario) |date=23 February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers of new drugs===
Under the ODA and EU legislation, many orphan drugs have been developed, including drugs to treat [[glioma]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[phenylketonuria]], [[snake venom]] poisoning, and [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Pharmaceitical Executive opines, that the "ODA is nearly universally acknowledged to be a success".&lt;ref name="Executive"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pharma's Orphans |author=Armstrong, Walter |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Executive |date=May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Before the [[United States Congress]] enacted the ODA in 1983, only 38 drugs were approved in the USA specifically to treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref name="Daly_2002"&gt;{{cite news |title=House Offers Incentives For Development of 'Orphan' Drugs |author=Rich Daly |newspaper=Congressional Quarterly Daily Monitor |date=5 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the USA, from January 1983 to June 2004, the Office of Orphan Products Development 249 orphan drugs received marketing authorization and granted 1,129 different orphan drug designations, compared to fewer than ten such products in the decade prior to 1983. 
From 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 orphan drugs and granted orphan designations to 2,116 compounds. 
As of 2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated orphan diseases have become treatable.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

Critics have questioned whether orphan drug legislation was the real cause of this increase, claiming that many of the new drugs were for disorders which were already being researched anyway, and would have had drugs developed regardless of the legislation, and whether the ODA has truly  stimulated the production of non-profitable drugs; the act also has been criticised for allowing some pharmaceutical companies to make a large profit of drugs which have a small market but sell for a high price.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

While the European Medicines Agency grants orphan drugs market access to all member states, in practice, they only reach the market when a member state decides that its national health system will reimburse for the drug. For example, in 2008, 44 orphan drugs reached the market in the Netherlands, 35 in Belgium, and 28 in Sweden, while in 2007, 35 such drugs reached the market in France and 23 in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denis |first1=Alain |last2=Mergaert |first2=Lut |last3=Fostier |first3=Christel |last4=et al|title=Issues Surrounding Orphan Disease and Orphan Drug Policies in Europe |journal=Applied Health Economics and Health Policy |volume= 8 |issue=5 |pages=341 |doi=10.2165/11536990-000000000-00000|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not technically an orphan disease, the research and development into the treatment for [[AIDS]] has been heavily linked to the [[Orphan Drug Act]]. In the beginning of the AIDS epidemic the lack of treatment for the disease was often accredited to a believed lack of commercial base for a medication linked to [[HIV]] infection. This encouraged the FDA to use the Orphan Drug Act to help bolster research in this field, and by 1995 13 of the 19 drugs approved by the FDA to treat AIDS had received orphan drug designation, with 10 receiving marketing rights. These are in addition to the 70 designated orphan drugs designed to treat other HIV related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arno|first=Peter S.|last2=Bonuck|first2=Karen|last3=Davis|first3=Michael|date=1995-01-01|title=Rare Diseases, Drug Development, and AIDS: The Impact of the Orphan Drug Act|jstor=3350258|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=73|issue=2|pages=231–252|doi=10.2307/3350258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples for selected diseases==

In the 1980s, people with [[cystic fibrosis]] rarely lived beyond their early teens. Drugs like [[Pulmozyme]] and [[tobramycin]], both developed with aid from the ODA, revolutionized treatment for cystic fibrosis patients by significantly improving their quality of life and extending their life expectancies. Now, cystic fibrosis patients often survive into their thirties and some into their fifties.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Illingworth |first1=Patricia |last2=Cohen |first2=Jillian |last3=Illingworth |first3=P |year=2004 |title=Orphan Drug Policies: Implications for the United States, Canada, and Developing Countries |journal=Health Law Journal |volume=12 |pages=183–200|pmid=16539081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1985 Nobel Prize for medicine went to two researchers for their work related to  [[familial hypercholesterolemia]], which causes large and rapid increases in cholesterol levels. Their research led to the development of [[Statins|statin drugs]] which are now commonly used to treat high cholesterol.&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt;

[[Penicillamine]] was developed to treat [[Wilson's disease]], a rare hereditary disease that can lead to a fatal accumulation of copper in the body. This drug was later found to be effective in treating [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt; [[Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate]] is currently under investigation as a therapy against Wilson's disease.

==Activism, research centers==
The [[Center for Orphan Drug Research]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] College of Pharmacy helps small companies with insufficient in-house expertise and resources in drug synthesis, formulation, pharmacometrics, and bio-analysis.&lt;ref name="Technology"&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebrating 25 Years of Orphan Drugs|author=Wechsler, Jill |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Technology |date=July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Keck Graduate Institute]] Center for Rare Disease Therapies (CRDT) in Claremont, California, supports projects to revive potential orphan drugs whose development has stalled by identifying barriers to commercialization, such as problems with formulation and bio-processing.&lt;ref name="Technology"/&gt;

Numerous advocacy groups such as the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]], [[Global Genes Project]], Children's Rare Disease Network, Abetalipoproteinemia Collaboration Foundation, Zellweger Baby Support Network, and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance have been founded in order to advocate on behalf of  patients suffering from rare diseases with a particular emphasis on diseases that afflict children.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

==Cost==
According to a 2015 report published by EvaluatePharma, the economics of orphan drugs mirrors the economics of the pharmaceutical market as a whole but has a few very large differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=EvaluatePharma Orphan Drug Report 2015| last=Hadjivasiliou| first=Andreas| publisher=EvaulatePharma| year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for orphan drugs is by definition very small, but while the customer base is drastically smaller the cost of research and development is very much the same as for non orphan drugs. This, the producers have claimed, causes them to charge extremely high amounts for treatment sometimes as high as $700,000 a year, as in the case of [[Spinraza]] (Biogen), FDA approved in December 2016 for spinal muscular atrophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Costly Drug for Fatal Muscular Disease Wins F.D.A. Approval|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/business/spinraza-price.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|agency=New York Times|date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing a large amount of stress on insurance companies and patients. An analysis of 12 orphan drugs that were approved in the US between 1990 and 2000 estimated a price reduction of on average 50% upon loss of marketing exclusivity, with a range of price reductions from 14% to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1750-1172-6-62?site=ojrd.biomedcentral.com|title=Estimating the budget impact of orphan medicines in Europe: 2010 - 2020|author=Carina Schey , Tsveta Milanova and Adam Hutchings|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|year=2011|volume=6|issue=62|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have implemented steps to reduce high research and development cost with subsidies and other forms of financial assistance. The largest assistance are tax breaks which can be as high as 50% of research and development costs.&lt;ref name=meek&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Meekings| first=Kiran N.|last2=Williams |first2=Cory S. M. |last3=Arrowsmith |first3=John E.| date=2012-07-01|title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644612000529|journal=Drug Discovery Today| volume=17| issue=13–14| pages=660–664|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.02.005|pmid=22366309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan drug manufacturers are also able to take advantage of the small customer base to cut cost on clinical trials due to the small number of cases to have smaller trials which reduces cost. These smaller clinical trials also allow orphan drugs to move to market faster as the average time to receive FDA approval for an orphan drug is 10 months compared to 13 months for non-orphan drugs. This is especially true in the market for cancer drugs, as a 2011 study found that between 2004 and 2010 orphan drug trials were more likely to be smaller and less randomized than their non-orphan counterparts, but still had a higher FDA approval rate, with 15 orphan cancer drugs being approved, while only 12 non-orphan drugs were approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kesselheim AS|last2=Myers JA|last3=Avorn J|date=2011-06-08|title=CHaracteristics of clinical trials to support approval of orphan vs nonorphan drugs for cancer|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2011.769|journal=JAMA|volume=305|issue=22|pages=2320–2326|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.769|issn=0098-7484|pmid=21642684}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows manufactures to get cost to the point that it is economically feasible to produce these treatments.&lt;ref name=meek/&gt; The subsidies can total up to 30 million dollars per fiscal year in the United States alone {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2017}}.

By 2015, industry analysts and academic researchers agreed, that the sky-high price of orphan drugs, such as [[eculizumab]], was not related to research, development and manufacturing costs. Their price is arbitrary and they have become more profitable than traditional medicines.&lt;ref name="CBC_Crowe_2015"&gt;{{citation |title=How pharmaceutical company Alexion set the price of the world's most expensive drug: Cost of one of world's most expensive drugs shrouded in corporate secrecy |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/how-pharmaceutical-company-alexion-set-the-price-of-the-world-s-most-expensive-drug-1.3125251 |first=Kelly |last=Crowe |work=CBC News |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Public resources went into understanding the molecular basis of the disease, public resources went into the technology to make antibodies and finally, Alexion, to their credit, kind of picked up the pieces."|Sachdev Sidhu 2015}}

By 2007 the use of economic evaluation methods regarding public-funding of orphan drugs, using estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness, for example, became more established internationally.&lt;ref name="Drummond_2007"&gt;{{citation |authors=Drummond MF, Grubert N. |title=International Trends in the Use of Health Economic Data |location=Waltham MA |series=Spectrum Report, Decision Resources |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The QALY has often been used in [[cost-utility analysis]] to calculate the ratio of cost to QALYs saved for a particular health care intervention.&lt;ref name="NICE_2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp | title=Measuring effectiveness and cost effectiveness: the QALY | publisher=NICE | date=20 April 2010 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nice.org.uk/article/pmg9/chapter/6-the-appraisal-of-the-evidence-and-structured-decision-making | title=Guide to the methods of technology appraisal 2013 | publisher=NICE | date=2013 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales, for example, operated with a threshold range of £20,000–£30,000 per [[Quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008"&gt;{{citation |title=Challenges in the economic evaluation of orphan drugs |first=Michael F |last=Drummond |publisher=World Health Organization |journal=Eurohealth |volume=14 |number= 2 |pages= 16–257 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2005 doubts were raised about the use of economic evaluations in orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="Drummond_2007" /&gt; By 2008 most of the orphan drugs appraised had cost-effectiveness thresholds "well in excess of the ‘accepted’ level and would not be reimbursed according to conventional criteria."&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008" /&gt; As early as 2005 McCabe et al argued&lt;ref name="McCabe_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007" /&gt; that rarity should not have a premium and orphan drugs should be treated like other pharmaceuticals in general.&lt;ref name="McCabe_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=McCabe C, Claxton K, Tsuchiya A. |title=Orphan drugs and the NHS |journal=British Medical Journal |year=2005 |volume=331 |pages=1016–19 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007"&gt;{{cite journal  |authors=McCabe C, Tsuchiya A, Claxton K, Raftery J.|title= Assessing the economic challenges posed by orphan drugs: a comment on Drummond et al. |journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care |year=2007 |volume=23 |number=3 |pages=397–404 |doi=10.1017/s0266462307071012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond et al&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007" /&gt; argued that the social value of health technologies should also be included in the assessment along than the estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

===Abuse potential===
[[File:Rosuvastatin-Formulae V 1.png|thumb|Rosuvastatin (brand name Crestor) is an example of a drug that received Orphan Drug funding but was later marketed to a large consumer base.]]
The very large incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to produce orphan drugs have led to the impression that the financial support afforded to make these drugs possible is akin to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simoens|first=Steven|date=2011-06-17|title=Pricing and reimbursement of orphan drugs: the need for more transparency|url=http://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1172-6-42|journal= Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-42|pmc=3132155|pmid=21682893|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because drugs can be used to treat multiple conditions, companies can take drugs that were filed with their government agency as orphan drugs to receive financial assistance, and then market it to a wide population to increase their [[profit margin]]. For example [[AstraZeneca]]'s cholesterol drug [[Rosuvastatin|Crestor]] was filed as a treatment for the rare disease pediatric [[familial hypercholesterolemia]]. After the drug was approved for orphan drug designation, and AstraZeneca had received tax breaks and other advantages, AstraZeneca later applied and received FDA approval for the drug to be used to treat cholesterol in all diabetics.&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt;

===NICE===

By 2008 if an orphan drug cost more than £30,000{{clarify|reason=30k per patient? For total cost of treatment? Per some time period?|date=July 2015}} the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|NICE]] required other arguments for funding.&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008" /&gt;

In 2015, NICE held consultations with "patient groups, the Department of Health, companies, learned societies, charities and researchers" regarding the appraisal of medicines and other technologies. There was a call for more research into new processes including the &lt;ref name="NICE_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=NICE calls for a new approach to managing the entry of drugs into the NHS |url= http://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/nice-calls-for-a-new-approach-to-managing-the-entry-of-drugs-into-the-nhs |date= 18 September 2014 |accessdate= 29 June 2015 |work=NICE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overnutrition''' or '''hyperalimentation''' is a form of [[malnutrition]] in which the intake of nutrients is oversupplied. The amount of nutrients exceeds the amount required for normal growth, development, and [[metabolism]]. 

The term can also refer to:
* [[Obesity]], which occurs by eating more calories than one burns, as well as:
* Oversupplying a ''specific'' nutrient, such as [[dietary minerals]] or [[vitamin poisoning]]. This is  due to an excessive intake or a nutritional imbalance caused by [[fad diet]]s.

For mineral excess, see:
* [[Iron poisoning]], and
* [[Low sodium diet]] (a response to excess sodium).

Overnutrition may also refer to greater [[food]] consumption than appropriate,&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000050758|hyperalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other feeding procedures such as [[parenteral nutrition]].

[[Image:FDR-Wheelchair-February-1941.jpg|thumb|260px|Rare photograph of Roosevelt in a wheelchair, with Ruthie Bie and [[Fala (dog)|Fala]] (1941)]]

The paralytic illness of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] began in 1921 when the future [[President of the United States]] was 39 years old. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. He was diagnosed with [[poliomyelitis]] at the time, but his symptoms are more consistent with [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) – an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility. In 1926, his belief in the benefits of [[hydrotherapy]] led him to found [[Warm Springs Historic District|a rehabilitation center]] at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]]. He avoided being seen using his wheelchair in public, but his disability was well known and became a major part of his image. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, leading to the development of polio vaccines.

In August 1921, 39-year-old Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the time a practicing lawyer in New York, joined his family at their vacation home at [[Campobello Island|Campobello]], a Canadian island off the coast of Maine. As former [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], he had spent two weeks in mid-July in Washington, D.C., giving testimony to a Senate committee investigating a Navy scandal.&lt;ref name="Collier-1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collier |first1=Peter |author-link1=Peter Collier (political author) |last2=Horowitz |first2=David |author-link2=David Horowitz |date=1994 |title=The Roosevelts: An American Saga |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster  |isbn=0671652257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247–248}} On August 5, Roosevelt sailed up the New England coast with his friend and new employer, [[Van Lear Black]], on Black's [[USS Sabalo (SP-225)|ocean-going yacht]]. Among those at Campobello when Roosevelt arrived were his wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]], their children, his political aide [[Louis Howe]], Howe's wife, and their young son.&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tobin |first1=James |title=The Man He Became: How FDR Defied Polio to Win the Presidency |date=2013 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=0743265165}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–42}}

On August 10, after a day of strenuous activity, Roosevelt came down with an illness characterized by [[fever]], [[paralysis|ascending paralysis]], facial paralysis, prolonged [[bowel]] and [[urinary bladder|bladder]] dysfunction, and numbness and [[dysesthesia|hypersensitivity of the skin]].&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|47}} Most of the symptoms resolved themselves, but he was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down.

Roosevelt came close to death from the illness. He faced many life-threatening medical problems including the possibility of respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, injury to the urethra or bladder, decubitus ulcers, clots in the leg veins, and malnutrition. Eleanor’s nursing care was responsible for Roosevelt’s survival.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|148–151}}

===Timeline===

'''July 28:''' 
Roosevelt visited the Boy Scout Jamboree at [[Bear Mountain State Park]].

'''August 5–8:''' 
Roosevelt traveled to Campobello on board the yacht ''[[USS Sabalo (SP-225)|Sabolo]]''.

'''August 9:'''
Roosevelt fell into the cold waters of the [[Bay of Fundy]]. Later, arrived at Campobello.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|233}}

'''August 10:'''
Roosevelt spent the day physically active. Afterward, he complained of chills, nausea, and pain in his lower back. He skipped dinner and went to bed. Chills lasted through the night.&lt;ref name="Collier-1994"/&gt;{{rp|252}} &lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|235}}

'''August 11:'''
In the morning, one of his legs felt weak. Roosevelt had fever.
Dr. Eben H. Bennet, a [[general practitioner]] in the nearby village of [[Lubec]] who had known the Roosevelts for years, visited Roosevelt and diagnosed a bad summer cold. By the evening, one leg was paralyzed, and the other had become weak.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|50–51}} &lt;ref name=Ditunno&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1097/00002060-200208000-00001 |vauthors=Ditunno JF, Herbison GJ |title= Franklin D. Roosevelt: diagnosis, clinical course, and rehabilitation from poliomyelitis |journal= Am J Phys Med Rehabil |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=557–66 |year=2002 |pmid=12172063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''August 12:'''
Both legs were paralyzed. His temperature was 102&amp;nbsp;°F. Pain shot through his legs, feet and back.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|51, 54}}
Bennet suggested a consultation with Dr. [[William Williams Keen|William W. Keen]], an eminent retired neurosurgeon vacationing nearby.&lt;ref name="Ditunno"/&gt;
Roosevelt's legs were numb. They then became painfully sensitive to touch. He could not pass urine.&lt;ref name=Ditunno/&gt; By evening, his hands were affected.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|51}}

'''August 13:'''
Roosevelt was paralyzed from the chest down. On that day and the following, his hands, arms, and shoulders were weak. He had difficulty moving his bowels and required [[enema]]s.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}
Keen made what Eleanor described as "a most careful, thorough examination".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|57–58}}

'''August 14:'''
Roosevelt continued to be unable to pass urine for two weeks, and required [[Urinary catheterization|catheterization]]. His fever continued for a total of six to seven days.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}
Keen repeated his examination, a bending and prodding that [[Elliott Roosevelt|Elliott]] later termed "excruciating" for his father.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|58}}
Keen diagnosed a clot of blood to the lower spinal cord, and prescribed massage of the leg muscles.&lt;ref name=Ditunno/&gt;
Eleanor and Howe began massaging Roosevelt's legs as instructed by Keen, bringing on agonizing pain.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

'''August 15:'''
Prostrate and mildly sedated, Roosevelt was occasionally delirious.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

'''August 19:'''
Frederic Delano, Roosevelt's uncle, had received a letter from Louis Howe requesting to find a doctor to come see Roosevelt. Delano called his son-in-law, a physician, who recommended he speak to another physician, a Dr. Parker. Parker told Delano that the case sounded like infantile paralysis, and that the leading authorities on the disease were at the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission in Boston. Delano caught a train and arrived the next morning.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|64}}

'''August 20:'''
Dr. [[Samuel A. Levine]] was at his office when Delano telephoned Brigham Hospital on Saturday morning. Levine said the senior members of the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission, Dr. Lovett and Dr. Peabody, were out of town, but he would try to answer Delano's questions. After reviewing the messages Delano had received from Campobello, Levine thought Roosevelt was suffering from acute poliomyelitis. He urged that a lumbar puncture be done, with the goal of making a diagnosis, but mainly because Levine believed there could be acute benefit from the procedure.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|64–65,327}} &lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|192}}
Delano phoned and wrote Eleanor the same day,&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|239}} advising her to stop massaging Roosevelt's legs, and to disregard Keen's advice: "I think it would be very unwise to trust his diagnosis where the Inf. Paralysis can be determined by test of the spinal fluid."&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|66}}
Eleanor communicated with Keen, who "very strenuously" resisted the idea of poliomyelitis. Keen asked Lovett to visit Campobello.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|66}}

'''August 22:'''
Lovett met Levine for dinner. Lovett asked how to distinguish whether paralysis was caused by poliomyelitis or by a clot or lesion of the spinal cord.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|183–184}}

'''August 23:'''
Lovett left for Campobello.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

'''August 24:'''
Lovett saw Roosevelt and performed a "more or less superficial" examination since Roosevelt was highly sensitive to touch. The arms were weak; the bladder was paralyzed; the left thumb indicated atrophy. Roosevelt could not stand or walk, and Lovett documented "scattered weakness, most marked in the hips".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

'''August 25:'''
Roosevelt's temperature was 100&amp;nbsp;°F. Both legs were paralyzed. His back muscles were weak. There was also weakness of the face and left hand. Pain in the legs and inability to urinate continued.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}} 
After a brief conference with Keen, Lovett saw Roosevelt. Lovett informed him that the "physical findings" presented a "perfectly clear" diagnosis of poliomyelitis.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|69–70}}
Lovett ordered an end to massage, which had no benefit and caused pain, and recommended a trained nurse to care for Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|75–76}}

'''September 1:'''
Roosevelt was still unable to urinate. His leg pain continued.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

'''September 14:'''
Roosevelt was transported to New York, by boat and train, a long and painful journey.

'''September 15:'''
Roosevelt was admitted to Presbyterian Hospital in New York City for convalescence, under the care of Dr. [[George Draper (physician)|George Draper]], an expert on poliomyelitis and Roosevelt's personal physician. Lovett continued to consult from Boston.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|76}}
There was pain in the legs, paralysis of the legs, muscle wasting in the lower [[lumbar]] area and the buttocks, weakness of the right triceps, and gross muscle twitching in both forearms.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}

'''October 28:'''
Roosevelt was transferred from Presbyterian Hospital to his house on East 65th Street. His chart still read "not improving".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|110}}

'''Later:'''
Roosevelt exercised daily. His hamstrings tightened, and his legs were encased in plaster to straighten them by degrees.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|238}}
There was gradual recovery, but he remained paralyzed from the waist down.

=== Diagnosis ===
After falling ill, Roosevelt was seen by four doctors. [[Eben Homer Bennet]], the Roosevelt family doctor, diagnosed a heavy cold. [[William Williams Keen|William Keen]], a retired neurosurgeon, thought Roosevelt had a blood clot. [[Robert Lovett (physician)|Robert Lovett]], an expert on the orthopedic management of children paralyzed from poliomyelitis, diagnosed "infantile paralysis", as did [[George Draper (physician)|George Draper]], Roosevelt's personal physician.

Roosevelt's physicians never mentioned [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) in their communications concerning Roosevelt's case, indicating that they were not aware of it as a diagnostic possibility.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|204}} All reports before 1921 of what is now called GBS were by European physicians, in European journals. The result was that very few American physicians knew that GBS was a separate disease. For example, Lovett mistakenly believed that Landry’s ascending paralysis, now termed GBS, was one of the clinical presentations of paralytic polio.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|203}} In 1921, an American physician would assume that if an individual developed a sudden, non-traumatic flaccid paralysis, it was due to paralytic polio. The concept of GBS as a separate disease was not widely accepted in the United States until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|232}}

=== Warm Springs ===
[[File:FDR-and-three-polio-patients-Warm-Springs-1925.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt with polio patients in Warm Springs, Georgia (1925)]]
Roosevelt first traveled to [[Warm Springs Historic District|Warm Springs]], Georgia, on October 3, 1924. For many years to come Warm Springs would be where he would retreat in comfort for [[hydrotherapy]]. On April 29, 1926, he bought the center with the intention of making it into a rehabilitation center for polio patients.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"&gt;{{Cite book |title=FDR’s Splendid Deception |last=Gallagher |first=Hugh |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, Inc |year=1985 |isbn=0918339502 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33–34}} One of Roosevelt's primary goals was to get the American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|222–226}}

=== Governor and President ===
In 1929 Roosevelt was elected Governor of New York and moved into the Governor's Mansion in Albany. Before he moved in, the mansion was made wheelchair-friendly with ramps and an elevator.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|68–87}}

Roosevelt won the Presidential election in 1932 in a landslide victory and became the first, and so far only, disabled person to be President of the United States. Before he moved into the White House, ramps were added to make it wheelchair-friendly. Any pictures of the President were taken at certain angles and at a distance.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|88–105}}

==Efforts to rehabilitate==
[[File:FDR-Pool-Warm-Springs-1929.jpg|right|thumb|Roosevelt at Warm Springs (1929)]]
Roosevelt was totally and permanently paralyzed from the waist down, and unable to stand or walk without support.&lt;ref name="Pressman Time"/&gt;  For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/from-the-castle-fdrs-stamps-144524734/?no-ist |title=From the Castle - FDR's Stamps |author=G. Wayne Clough |magazine=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him to determine the extent of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another.&lt;ref name="NPR Tobin"/&gt; He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that he could stand with crutches. In 1922, at [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|Springwood]], he worked diligently to make his way across the room. He set himself the goal of getting down the long driveway, managing to do it once, but never trying again.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|241}}

In October 1922, Roosevelt visited his law office at the [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]], where a welcome-back luncheon had been arranged. The chauffeur assisting him failed to brace the tip of his left crutch and Roosevelt fell onto the highly polished lobby floor. Laughing, he asked two young men in the crowd of onlookers to help get him back on his feet. After the luncheon, he told friends it was a "grand and glorious occasion". He did not return to his office for two months.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Geoffrey C. |authorlink1=Geoffrey Ward |last2=Burns |first2=Ken |authorlink2=Ken Burns |date=2014 |title=The Roosevelts: An Intimate History |location=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |isbn=9780307700230}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|245}}

Roosevelt believed that warmth and exercise would help rebuild his legs. He bought a run-down 71-foot houseboat and, in February 1923, sailed to Florida with friends and a small crew. Eleanor found it dull and left, but Roosevelt sailed for weeks, fishing and spending time with a succession of friends who came to visit. He designed a pulley system that lowered him into the water to swim. In May 1923, Lovett documented no overall improvement over the preceding year, but Roosevelt would not accept his doctors' determination that further progress was unlikely. He tried a range of therapies and made two more voyages on his houseboat, but his efforts had no effect.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|247–249}}

"Between 1925 and 1928, Franklin would spend more than half his time—116 of 208 weeks—away from home, struggling to find a way to regain his feet," wrote biographer [[Geoffrey Ward]]. "Eleanor was with him just 4 of those 116 weeks, and his mother was with him for only 2. His children hardly saw him."&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|248}}

Roosevelt lost the use of his legs and two inches of height, but the subsequent development of the rest of his body gave him a robust physique, and he enjoyed many years of excellent health. [[Jack Dempsey]] praised his upper-body musculature, and Roosevelt once landed a 237-pound shark after fighting it on his line for two hours.&lt;ref name="gunther1950"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gunther |first=John |authorlink=John Gunther |date=1950 |title=Roosevelt in Retrospect |url=https://archive.org/details/rooseveltinretro00gunt |location=New York |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]] |oclc=466356}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241, 266–267}}

With his physiotherapist at Warm Springs, Roosevelt laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs, by swiveling his torso. For this "two-point walk", he would grip the arm of a strong person with his left hand, and brace himself with a cane in his right.

== Social impact ==
Roosevelt was the United States' first disabled president, so there has been discussion concerning how he handled his health. Disability advocate [[Hugh Gallagher (advocate)|Hugh Gallagher]] posited that Roosevelt was desperate to appear able-bodied. When discussing Roosevelt's limited use of a wheelchair in public, Gallagher stated, "This was not by accident. It was a strategy that served to minimize the extent of his handicap, to make it unnoticed when possible and palatable when it was noticed.".&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|xiv}} Historian James Tobin argued that Roosevelt used his disability to his advantage. Tobin stated, "But he could, instead, show himself to be something he had never been seen as before: a fighter and, and better yet, an underdog; not a man to pity, not a man to envy, but a man to cheer."&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|273}} Despite any controversy, Roosevelt has become an inspirational figure for disabled people around the world. The [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial|Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] includes a statue of Roosevelt in a wheelchair.

Roosevelt was able to convince many people that he was getting better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches, Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the podium.

His public appearances were choreographed to avoid the press covering his arrival and departure, which would have shown him getting into or out of a vehicle. When possible, his vehicle was driven into a building's parking garage for his arrivals and departures.  On other occasions, the vehicle would be driven onto a ramp to avoid steps, which Roosevelt was unable to ascend.  When that was not practical, the steps would be covered with a ramp with railings, with Roosevelt using his arms to pull himself upward. When traveling by train, Roosevelt often appeared on the rear platform of the [[Ferdinand Magellan Railcar|presidential railroad car]].  When he boarded or disembarked, the private car was sometimes shunted to an area of the railroad yard away from the public for reasons of security and privacy. When Roosevelt's train used a ramp and the president was on a publicly known trip, he insisted on walking on the ramp no matter how difficult.

Journalist [[John Gunther]] reported that in the 1930s he often met people in Europe, including world leaders, who were unaware of Roosevelt's paralysis.&lt;ref name="gunther1950"/&gt;{{rp|239}} [[David Brinkley]], who was a young White House reporter in World War II, stated that the Secret Service actively interfered with photographers who tried to take pictures of Roosevelt in a wheelchair or being moved about by others. The Secret Service commonly destroyed photographs they caught being taken in this manner; however, there were occasional exceptions.&lt;ref name="Pressman Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/07/12/the-myth-of-fdrs-secret-disability/|title=The Myth of FDR's Secret Disability |author=Pressman, Matthew |accessdate=Aug 12, 2013 |work=Time|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748188-2,00.html | work=Time | title=THE PRESIDENCY: New Quarters | date=December 17, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT Goldberg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg |first=Richard T. |date=1981 |title=The Making of Franklin D.

===March of Dimes===
{{main|March of Dimes}}

On January 3, 1938, Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the [[March of Dimes]].&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt; [[Basil O'Connor]], an attorney and close associate of Roosevelt, helped establish the foundation and was its president for more than three decades.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baghdady |first=Maddock J. |title=Marching to a Different Mission |journal=Stanford Social Innovation Review |year=2008 |pages=60–65 |url=http://www.ssireview.org/images/articles/2008SP_casestudy_baghdady_maddock.pdf |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's annual fundraising campaign coincided with Roosevelt's birthday on January 30. The organization initially focused on the rehabilitation of victims of paralytic polio and supported the work of [[Jonas Salk]] and others that led to the development of [[polio vaccine]]s. Today, the March of Dimes focuses on preventing premature births, congenital disabilities, and infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt;

Because he founded the March of Dimes, a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] was chosen to honor Roosevelt after his death. The [[Dime (United States coin)#Franklin D. Roosevelt (1946–present)|Roosevelt dime]] was issued on January 30, 1946.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;Barrett, William P. "March of Dimes' Second Act".

==Retrospective diagnosis==

===Analysis of symptoms===
A 2003 peer-reviewed study of Roosevelt's paralytic illness, using three diagnostic methods - pattern recognition, reconstructing the pathogenesis, and [[Bayesian analysis]] - favored a diagnosis of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) over poliomyelitis.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Goldman AS, Schmalstieg EJ, Freeman DH, Goldman DA, Schmalstieg FC | title=What was the cause of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's paralytic illness? | journal=Journal of Medical Biography | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=232–40 | year=2003 | pmid=14562158 | url=http://www.ehdp.com/out/jmb_2003_v11_p232-240.pdf | doi= | accessdate=2017-07-04 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Bayesian analysis, the best estimate of the annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of GBS was 1.3 per 100,000. For paralytic polio in Roosevelt's age group, an annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of 1.0 per 100,000 was used. The paralytic polio rate was derived from the exceptionally severe polio epidemic that struck New York City in 1916, to tilt the odds in favor of polio. The prior probability of paralytic polio in Roosevelt’s age group in the United States in 1921 was likely much lower because paralytic polio was at one of its lowest ebbs in the Northeastern region of the country at that time.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|123}} &lt;ref name="History of Vaccines"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/polio |title=History of Polio |date= |website=The History of Vaccines |publisher=[[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|26}} In July 1921, three cases were reported in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 26, 1921 |title=Find Infantile Paralysis; Three Cases Develop in Paterson  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/07/26/archives/find-infantile-paralysis-three-cases-develop-in-paterson-health.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By late August some 100 cases were reported in the state of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 23, 1921 |title=Infantile Paralysis is Spreading Up State  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/08/23/archives/infantile-paralysis-is-spreading-up-state-about-100-cases-are.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rates for GBS and paralytic polio, and symptom probabilities from the medical literature, Roosevelt's symptoms were analyzed by Bayesian analysis to obtain posterior probabilities, as listed below.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Six of eight symptoms favored GBS, with the [[posterior probability]] of GBS shown for each:
* 98% - Roosevelt’s paralysis was symmetric and ascending, and progressed more than four days, whereas the paralysis in poliomyelitis is typically asymmetric, variable in its ascent or descent, and usually progresses for only two to four days. A review of the medical research literature revealed only one report of paralytic polio with a symmetric, ascending paralysis.
* 98% - Roosevelt's numbness and [[hyperesthesia]] rarely if ever occur in paralytic polio (motor neurons affected), but are common in GBS (sensory neurons also affected).
* 98% - A consistent descending pattern of recovery from paralysis is absent in paralytic polio, but common in GBS.
* 97% - Facial paralysis, as Roosevelt had, in the absence of other cranial nerve abnormalities, is not consistent with a polio diagnosis, but is common in GBS.
* 93% - Roosevelt's prolonged bladder and bowel dysfunction are rare in paralytic polio, since polioviruses do not attack autonomic nerves, but are common in GBS.
* 93% - [[Meningismus]] (neck stiffness), a characteristic feature of paralytic polio, was absent in Roosevelt’s case.

Two of eight symptoms favored polio, with the [[posterior probability]] of polio shown for each:
* 99% - Roosevelt had fever up to 102&amp;nbsp;°F (38.9&amp;nbsp;°C), which is rare in GBS, although the pattern of the fever that Roosevelt experienced was atypical of paralytic polio.
* 72% - Roosevelt had permanent paralysis, which occurs in about 50% of paralytic polio survivors, and only about 15% of cases of GBS.

Using all eight symptoms in a Bayesian analysis, based on disease incidence rates and symptom probabilities from the medical literature, the overall probability that Roosevelt had GBS is over 99%.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|242–250}}

===When might exposure have occurred?===
It is possible Roosevelt was exposed to an infectious agent at the Boy Scout Jamboree in late July. The two-week interval before the onset of his neurological illness was in keeping with both the incubation period of poliomyelitis,&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|13–30}} and with exposure to an infectious agent leading to GBS.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|183}} There are no reports that any scouts or personnel at the camp were ill around the time of Roosevelt’s visit. In 1912 and 1915, Roosevelt had illnesses compatible with ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', a major causative agent of GBS.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

===Was Roosevelt predisposed to polio?===
It has been stated that Roosevelt may have been predisposed to paralytic polio by genetic inheritance.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|40}} However, such a genetic predisposition has never been discovered.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|195}} Several authors have stated that Roosevelt was more vulnerable to polio since he was raised on an isolated family estate&lt;ref name="NPR Tobin"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/11/25/247155522/roosevelts-polio-wasn-t-a-secret-he-used-it-to-his-advantage | title=Roosevelt's Polio Wasn't A Secret: He Used It To His 'Advantage' | date=November 25, 2013 |website=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had little contact with other children until he entered Groton at age 14. However, Roosevelt was not a "boy in a bubble". He had many possible exposures to polioviruses before 1921. Most polio cases are asymptomatic or a mild illness. Yet those asymptomatic individuals can transmit the viral infection.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|109}} When the prior probability of paralytic polio was artificially made 100-fold higher, to 99.4%, overall Bayesian analysis of Roosevelt's symptoms still greatly favored GBS (99.97% posterior probability). Roosevelt’s symptoms are typical of GBS, not of paralytic polio, so they overwhelm the initial prior probability.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

===Was a lumbar puncture done?===
A 2014 book argued that a lumbar puncture was done, based on excerpts from an "unpublished note" by Dr. [[Samuel A. Levine]] of the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission. The book stated, "Levine's private note indicates that Dr. Lovett did examine the cerebrospinal fluid and knew very well that a high level of white blood cells was consistent with poliomyelitis. . . . If Lovett had discovered a low white blood cell count, he would have doubted that poliomyelitis was the cause of Roosevelt's illness. Yet Lovett wrote George Draper that "I thought [the diagnosis] was perfectly clear as far as the physical findings were concerned.""&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|327–328}}

A 2017 book finally published the note. Based on the full text, the note was not found to support the idea that a spinal tap was performed, because: 
1) The note, written many years after 1921, had many errors. 
2) Levine never saw Roosevelt. 
3) Levine did not mention who did the procedure, or the results. 
4) Lovett had made it clear he would not do the procedure. 
5) None of Roosevelt's physicians at Campobello were equipped to do the procedure. 
6) "Physical findings" means information gained from a physical examination of the patient. Lovett described many "physical findings": hyperesthesia, facial paralysis, etc. But neither he, any of Roosevelt's other physicians at Campobello, Roosevelt, Eleanor, nor any of Roosevelt's associates ever said that a spinal tap was done.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Armond S. | last2=Goldman | first2=Daniel A. | date=2017 | title=Prisoners of Time: The Misdiagnosis of FDR's 1921 Illness | publisher=EHDP Press | isbn=978-1939824035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183–201}}

The 2017 book went on to say: "Given the invasive nature of a spinal tap, and the difficulty that would have occurred doing the procedure on a patient in FDR’s condition, it seems highly unlikely that a direct observer would have failed to mention anything about it. . . . Even if a spinal tap had been performed, it would have been done at the earliest about 15 days after the onset of the neurological illness, around when Lovett first saw Roosevelt. . . . One should keep in mind that the classical distinction between paralytic polio and GBS, the concentrations of leukocytes and total protein in CSF, blurs after the first several days of the onset of paralysis in both diseases."&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|193,198}}

== Could the outcome have been changed? ==
"In any event, there was no cure for either disease in 1921," [[The Defining Moment|wrote]] biographer [[Jonathan Alter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alter |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Alter |date=2007 |title=The Defining Moment: FDR's Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=355 |isbn=9780743246019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Levine mistakenly thought that the main benefit of a spinal tap, if done, would be to improve the outcome by lowering elevated CSF pressure.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|192}} And even today, some authors mistakenly believe that Roosevelt's paralysis, assuming a polio diagnosis, could have been prevented with early intervention.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|45,49,62,66}} However, there is no objective evidence that a spinal tap lessens the possibility of paralysis in polio. And it is unlikely Roosevelt's physicians would have tried human serum injections into the CSF, or that such injections would have helped. Lovett did not think the injections were useful, and there were alarming meningeal symptoms associated with them, probably secondary to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|199–200}} Concerning GBS, virtually all of the effective measures that are currently standard practice for the medical management of GBS were not developed until many decades after Roosevelt's 1921 illness, so Roosevelt's prognosis would not have improved even if GBS had been diagnosed.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|238}}

This [[postpartum period]] (less commonly, puerperium or puerperal period) begins immediately after the birth, and lasts for a culturally variable length: typically for one month or 30 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=/PHN/PHN12_03/S1368980008002152a.pdf&amp;code=3ba0290fddc1bb0d50aadfcbedad50cd |title=Effect of Alcohol consumption on Maternal lactation characteristics during ‘doing-the-month’ ritual |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, up to 40 days, two months or 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/a1021145/confinement-practices-an-overview|title=Confinement practices: an overview|website=BabyCenter|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This postnatal recuperation can include "traditional health beliefs, taboos, rituals, and proscriptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tung|first1=Wei-Chen|title=Doing the Month and Asian Cultures: Implications for Health Care|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=22 June 2010|volume=22|issue=5|pages=369–371|doi=10.1177/1084822310367473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice used to be known as "[[lying-in]]", which, as the term suggests, centres around [[bed rest]].

The custom is well-documented in China, where it is known as "Sitting the month". Japanese women know it as "''Sango no hidachi''" and Koreans as "''Samchilil''", which means "thirty-one". In Latin American countries it is called ''la cuarentena'', i.e. "forty days" (the source of the English word "[[quarantine]]"). In India it is called ''jaappa'' (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] ''japa'').

==Commonalities and benefits==
[[File:Breastfeeding-7.jpg|thumb|A mother breastfeeds her infant while another woman gives support.]]
Postpartum confinement refers both to the mother and the baby. Human [[newborn]]s are so underdeveloped that pediatricians such as [[Harvey Karp]] refer to the first three months as the "fourth trimester"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/24/155426534/dr-karp-on-parenting-and-the-science-of-sleep|title=Dr. Karp On Parenting And The Science Of Sleep|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=National Public Radio|access-date=February 19, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|department=All Things Considered|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The weeks of rest while the mother heals also protect the infant as [[Adaptation to extrauterine life|it adjusts to the world]], and both learn the skills of [[breastfeeding]].

A 2016 American book describes the difficulties of documenting these "global grandmotherly customs" but asserts that "like a golden rope connecting women from one generation to the next, the protocol of caring for the new mother by unburdening her of responsibilities and ensuring she rests and eats shows up in wildly diverse places"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ou|first1=Heng|last2=Amely|first2=Greeven|last3=Belger|first3=Marisa|title=The First Forty Days: The Essential Art of Nourishing the New Mother|date=2016|isbn=9781617691836}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One meta-review of studies concluded, "There is little consistent evidence that confinement practices reduce postpartum depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=Josephine|last2=Fisher|first2=Jane|title=The role of traditional confinement practices in determining postpartum depression in women in Chinese cultures: A systematic review of the English language evidence|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=August 2009|volume=116|issue=3|pages=161–169|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2008.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all countries have some form of [[maternity leave]]. Many countries encourage men to take some [[paternity leave]], but even those that mandate that some of the shared [[parental leave]] must be used by the father ("[[father's quota]]") acknowledge that the mother needs time off work to recover from the childbirth and deal with the [[postpartum physiological changes]].

"Sitting the month": 坐月子 "''Zuò yuè zi''" in Mandarin or 坐月 "Co5 Jyut2" in Cantonese.  The custom, going back to the year 960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/i-tried-the-chinese-practice-of-sitting-the-month-after-childbirth/2017/01/06/54517ee0-ad0b-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html|title=I tried the Chinese practice of 'sitting the month' after childbirth|last=Hsu Oh|first=Leslie|date=8 January 2017|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is referred to as 'confinement' as women are advised to stay indoors for recovery from the trauma of birth and feed the newborn baby. Aspects of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are included, with a special focus on eating foods considered to be nourishing for the body and help with the production of [[breastmilk]]. In [[Guangdong]] and neighboring regions, new mothers are barred from visitors until the baby is 12 days old, marked by a celebration called 'Twelve mornings' (known as 十二朝). From this day onwards, Cantonese families with a new baby usually share their joy through giving away food gifts, while some families mark the occasion by [[Ancestor veneration in China|paying tribute to their ancestors]]. 

In [[ancient China]], women of certain ethnic groups in the South would resume work right after birth, and allow the men to practice postpartum confinement instead.&lt;ref&gt;《[[太平廣記]]》卷四八三引[[尉遲樞]]的《[[南楚新聞]]》記載："南方有[[仡佬族|獠婦]]，生子便起。其夫臥床褥，飲食皆如乳婦。"《[[马可·波罗游记]]》："[[傣族]]妇女产子，洗后裹以襁褓，产妇立起工作，产妇之夫则抱子卧床四十日"；《黔记》卷二：郎慈苗在咸宁州，其俗更异，妇人产子，必夫守房，不逾门户，弥月乃出。产妇则出入耕作，措饭食，以供夫乳儿，日无暇刻。"&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Couvade]].)

=== Everyday habits and personal hygiene practices ===
During confinement, mothers are told not to expose their body to physical agents such cold weather or wind, as these are claimed to be detrimental to their recovery. Specifically, mothers were traditionally not allowed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgmmbb.com/chanhou/zyz/092M0T2010.html 坐月子能洗头吗?坐月子洗头对身体有什么影响？]&lt;/ref&gt; to have any contact with water (e.g. bathing or washing hair), to exert themselves by climbing stairs, to read books or cry, to sew, or to have sex. 

Nowadays, however, new mothers may wash their hair or take a bath or shower infrequently during the postpartum period, but it is claimed to be important to dry their body immediately afterwards with a clean towel and their hair properly using a hair dryer. It is also claimed to be important for women to wrap up warm and minimize the amount of skin exposed, as it was believed that they may catch a cold during this vulnerable time.

=== Special foods ===
[[File:Pig_feet_ginger.jpg|thumb|Pork knuckle with ginger and black vinegar]]
The custom of confinement advises new mothers to choose energy and protein-rich foods to recover energy levels, help shrink the [[uterus]] and for the [[perineum]] to heal. This is also important for the production of [[Breast milk|breastmilk]]. Sometimes, new mothers only begin to consume special herbal foods after all the [[lochia]] is discharged.

A common dish is [[Pork Knuckles and Ginger Stew|pork knuckles with ginger and black vinegar]] as pork knuckles are believed to help replenish calcium levels in the women. Ginger is featured in many dishes, as it is believed that it can remove the 'wind' accumulated in the body during pregnancy. Meat-based soup broths are also commonly consumed to provide hydration and added nutrients. Although not entirely backed by scientific evidence, for example, fish and papaya soup is considered to help produce breastmilk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/a1023191/milk-booster-fish-and-papaya-soup|title=Milk booster: fish and papaya soup|website=BabyCenter|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other East Asian countries==
Other [[East Asian]] cultures, such as [[South Korean culture|South Korean]] and [[Vietnamese culture|Vietnamese]], have their own versions of "sitting the month", combining prescribed foods with proscribed activities. Similar practices are popular among Japanese women called 産後の肥立ち "''Sango no hidachi''" and Korean women called 삼칠일 "''Samchilil''" for at least 21 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://littleseouls.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/korean-postpartum-rituals-21-days.html|title=Little Seouls Blog: Korean Postpartum Rituals 삼칠일 (21 days)|website=littleseouls.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new mother is given special postnatal foods, such as [[Miyeokguk|seaweed soup]] in Korea. ''Samchilil'' is practiced in addition to other traditions encompassed in [[sanhujori]], which is Korea's version of postnatal care. During this period of time that could extend beyond the 21 days, women followed principles that emphasize activities and foods that keep the body warm, rest and relaxation to maximize the body’s return to its normal state, maintaining cleanliness, eating nutritious foods, and peace of mind and heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jeongeun|date=March 2003|title=Survey on the Programs ofSanhujoriCenters in Korea as the Traditional Postpartum Care Facilities|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1300%2FJ013v38n02_08|journal=Women &amp; Health|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=107–117|doi=10.1300/j013v38n02_08|issn=0363-0242}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Thailand ''yu-fai'' ("lie down by a fire") treatment is traditional postpartum healing. Performed in an open area, it involves using smokeless tamarind wood, local herbs and massage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Lie down by a fire |url=http://bangkokpost.com/multimedia/vdo/thailand/427374/lie-down-by-a-fire  |newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]]|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Most traditional Indians follow the 40-day confinement and recuperation period also known as the ''jaappa'' (in Hindi). A special diet to facilitate milk production and increase hemoglobin levels is followed. Sex is not allowed during this time. In Hindu culture, this time after childbirth was traditionally considered a period of relative impurity (''asaucham''), and a period of confinement of 10–40 days (known as ''purudu'') was recommended for the mother and the baby. During this period, she was exempted from usual household chores and religious rites. The father was [[ritual purification|purified by a ritual bath]] before visiting the mother in confinement. 

In the event of a stillbirth, the period of impurity for both parents was 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Marshall / Jaya Tirtha Charan Dasa |url=http://www.hknet.org.nz/asaucham-info.htm |title=GUIDE TO RITUAL IMPURITY - What to do at the junctions of birth and death |publisher=Hknet.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many Indian subcultures have their own traditions after birth. This birth period is called Virdi (Marathi), which lasts for 10 days after birth and includes complete abstinence from ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' or temple visits.

==Latin America==
The ''cuarantena'' (literally, forty days, also meaning [[quarantine]]) is practised in parts of Latin America, and amongst immigrant communities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/04/why_wont_this_new_mom_wash_her_hair.html|title=Why Won't This New Mom Wash Her Hair?|last=Tuhus-Dubrow|first=Rebecca|date=11 April 2011|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as "intergenerational family ritual that facilitated adaptation to parenthood", including some paternal [[role reversal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niska|first1=Kathleen|last2=Snyder|first2=Mariah|last3=Lia-Hoagberg|first3=Betty|title=Family Ritual Facilitates Adaptation to Parenthood|journal=Public Health Nursing|date=October 1998|volume=15|issue=5|pages=329–337|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1446.1998.tb00357.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European cultures==
{{Main|Lying-in}}
[[File:4 Master of Charles of Durazzo (Francesco di Michele) A Birth Scene (Desco da Parte), c. 1410 Harvard Art museum (2).jpg|thumb|A mother in [[Florence]] lying-in, from a painted ''[[desco da parto]]'' or birth tray of c. 1410. As women tend to the child, expensively dressed female guests are already arriving.]]
The term used in English, now old-fashioned or [[archaism|archaic]], was once used to name [[maternity hospital]]s, for example the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] in London. A 1932 Canadian publication refers to lying-in as ranging from two weeks to two months.&lt;ref name="Nusche"&gt;[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/6/675 Lying in by Jan Nusche] quoting ''The Bride's Book — A Perpetual Guide for the Montreal Bride'', published in 1932&lt;/ref&gt; These weeks ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the [[churching of women]]. 

Lying-in features in [[Christian art]], notably ''[[Nativity of Christ in art|Birth of Jesus]]'' paintings. One of the gifts presented to the new mother in Renaisssance Florence was a ''[[desco da parto]]'', a special form of painted tray.

== Modern commercial versions ==
Traditionally, women were taken care of by their elders: their mother, mother-in-law, sister, or aunt. The lying-in hospitals provided an institutional variation which gave women weeks of bedrest and a respite from household chores.

Increasingly, these older women are unavailable or unwilling to take on this role; given the lingering effects of the [[one-child policy]], many older Chinese women had limited experience of newborn babies, having only had one themselves. Replacements for this familial help are commercial services, both in the home and at residential centres. 

Agencies provide specialist carers that come to the new parents' home. This job used to be known as the [[monthly nurse]], as she came and lived with the family for a month. Now more common terms are maternity nurse, newborn care specialist, or [[Nanny#maternity_nurse.2FNewborn_Care_Specialists.2FConfinement_Nanny|confinement nanny]]; the worker is not a registered health care professional such as the word "[[nurse]]" usually implies in current English. In [[Indian English]] the role is called a "''japa'' maid". A [[doula]] is best known as a birth companion, but some provide practical and emotional post-birth support. A [[lactation consultant]] and a [[health visitor]] are trained health professionals who may assist the new mother at this time. In the Netherlands, the in-home support is known as ''[[kraamzorg]]''.

The use of ''yue sao'', a specialist carer translated in Canada as "postpartum doula",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quan|first1=Douglas|title=Underground industry serves moms who follow Chinese custom of 'sitting the month' after childbirth|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/buyer-beware-underground-industry-serves-moms-who-follow-chinese-custom-of-sitting-the-month-after-childbirth|accessdate=28 October 2017|publisher=National Post|date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also very common in China. ''Yue Sao'' typically are live-in domestic helpers who care for both the new mother and baby for the first month after birth. Salaries as at 2017 vary from RMB8000 to RMB20000 per month depending on city and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=http://www.ayicheng.com/yue-sao-baby-china-blog/?lang=en|title= Yue Sao|website= Ayicheng|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as "mothering the mother"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ownyourbirth|url=https://www.ownyourbirth.ca/single-post/2017/11/07/Zuo-Yue-Zi-%E5%9D%90%E6%9C%88-Sitting-the-Month|website=ownyourbirth|accessdate=17 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Australian documentary-maker [[Aela Callan]] called them "Chinese supermums" but says they are colloquially known as "confinement ladies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China’s Supermums|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/chinas-supermums|website=News|publisher=[[SBS (Australian TV channel)]]|accessdate=17 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Companies have sprung up to offer extended postpartum care outside the home, sometimes in a hotel-like environment. Luxury options are big business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where a new baby means relaxation|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/babies/where-a-new-baby-means-relaxation/news-story/b5ebe958a84a9c6e560883a073e94730|website=NewsComAu|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private postpartum care centres were introduced to Korea in 1996 under the name of ''[[Sanhujori|sanhujoriwon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michiyo|first=Nomura|date=2016|title=A Study on the Continuance and Variation of Korean Traditional Postnatal Care in a Modern Postpartum Care Center|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE06723909|journal=The Korean Folklore Society|volume=63|pages=37–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Chinese tradition, specialist businesses such as Red Wall Confinement Centre charge up to $27,000 for one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/business/international/china-confinement-care-for-new-mothers-now-27000-a-month.html|title= Red Wall Confinement Centre|website=New York Times|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth tourism]] centres operating under the radar in the United States for Chinese women offer "sitting the month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ni|first1=Ching-Ching|title='Birthing tourism' center in San Gabriel shut down|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/25/local/la-me-birthing-center-20110325|accessdate=14 April 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pre-labor''''', also called '''"prodromal labor"''', consists of the early signs before [[childbirth|labor]] starts. It is the body's preparation for real labor.

Prodromal labor has been misnamed as “false labor."  Prodromal labor begins much as traditional labor but does not progress to the [[birth]] of the [[baby]].  Not everyone feels this stage of labor, though it does always occur. However, this does not mean that every woman will experience every symptom. The term is used to describe a cluster of physical changes that may take place in a pregnant woman before she goes into "real" labor, such as an increase in blood volume (sometimes resulting in [[edema]]), [[Braxton Hicks contractions]], the presence of [[colostrum]] in the breasts, and the dislodging of the [[Cervical mucus plug|mucous plug]] that has sealed the [[cervix]] during the pregnancy.

The term "false labor" is sometimes used to describe a cluster of Braxton Hicks contractions that are mistaken for real labor.

The term "false labor" and "false pains" are sometimes considered equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000077431|false pains}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prenatal testing''' consists of '''prenatal screening''' and '''prenatal diagnosis''', which are aspects of [[prenatal care]] that focus on detecting problems with the pregnancy as early as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/prenataltesting.html|title=Prenatal Testing|last=|first=|date=|website=MedlinePlus|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be [[anatomy|anatomic]] and [[physiology|physiologic]] problems with the health of the [[zygote]], [[embryo]], or [[fetus]], either before [[gestation]] even starts (as in [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]) or as early in gestation as practicable. Screening can detect problems such as [[neural tube defect]]s, [[chromosome]] abnormalities, and gene [[mutation]]s that would lead to [[genetic disorder]]s and [[birth defect]]s, such as [[spina bifida]], [[cleft palate]], [[Down syndrome|Downs Syndrome]], [[Tay–Sachs disease]], [[sickle cell anemia]], [[thalassemia]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[muscular dystrophy]], and [[fragile X syndrome]]. Some tests are designed to discover problems which primarily affect the health of the mother, such as [[Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A|PAPP-A]] to detect [[pre-eclampsia]] or [[glucose tolerance test]]s to diagnose [[gestational diabetes]]. Screening can also detect anatomical defects such as [[hydrocephalus]], [[anencephaly]], [[Congenital heart defect|heart defects]], and [[Amniotic band constriction|amniotic band syndrome]].

Prenatal [[screening (medicine)|screening]] focuses on finding problems among a large population with affordable and noninvasive methods. Prenatal [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] focuses on pursuing additional detailed information once a particular problem has been found, and can sometimes be more invasive. The most common screening procedures are routine [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasounds]], blood tests, and blood pressure measurement. Common diagnosis procedures include [[amniocentesis]] and [[chorionic villus sampling]]. In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the fetus will be [[abortion|aborted]], though physicians and patients also find it useful to diagnose high-risk pregnancies early so that delivery can be scheduled in a [[health care#Tertiary care|tertiary care]] hospital where the baby can receive appropriate care.

==Reasons for prenatal screening and diagnosis==
There are three purposes of prenatal diagnosis: (1) to enable timely medical or surgical treatment of a condition before or after birth, (2) to give the parents the chance to abort a fetus with the diagnosed condition, and (3) to give parents the chance to prepare psychologically, socially, financially, and medically for a baby with a health problem or disability, or for the likelihood of a stillbirth.

Having this information in advance of the birth means that healthcare staff as well as parents can better prepare themselves for the delivery of a child with a health problem.  For example, Down Syndrome is associated with cardiac defects that may need intervention immediately upon birth.

Many expectant parents would like to know the sex of their baby before birth.  Methods include [[Cell-free fetal DNA|cell-free fetal DNA analysis]], [[amniocentesis]] with [[karyotype|karyotyping]], and prenatal [[ultrasound]].  In some countries, health care providers are expected to withhold this information from parents, while in other countries they are expected to give this information.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Qualifying risk factors===
Because of the miscarriage and fetal damage risks associated with amniocentesis and CVS procedures, many women prefer to first undergo screening so they can find out if the fetus' risk of birth defects is high enough to justify the risks of invasive testing.  Since screening tests yield a risk score which represents the chance that the baby has the birth defect, the most common threshold for high-risk is 1:270.  A risk score of 1:300 would therefore be considered low-risk by many physicians.  However, the trade-off between risk of birth defect and risk of complications from invasive testing is relative and subjective; some parents may decide that even a 1:1000 risk of birth defects warrants an invasive test while others wouldn't opt for an invasive test even if they had a 1:10 risk score.

[[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]] guidelines currently recommend that all pregnant women, regardless of age, be offered invasive testing to obtain a definitive diagnosis of certain birth defects.  Therefore, most physicians offer diagnostic testing to all their patients, with or without prior screening and let the patient decide.

The following are some reasons why a patient might consider her risk of birth defects already to be high enough to warrant skipping screening and going straight for invasive testing.

*Women over the age of 35
*Women who have previously had premature babies or babies with a birth defect, especially heart or genetic problems
*Women who have [[high blood pressure]], [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[diabetes]], [[asthma]], or [[epilepsy]]
*Women who have family histories or ethnic backgrounds prone to genetic disorders, or whose partners have these
*Women who are pregnant with multiples (twins or more)
*Women who have previously had miscarriages

==Tests by Invasiveness==
Diagnostic prenatal testing can be performed by [[invasive (medical)|invasive]] or [[Non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] methods. An invasive method involves probes or needles being inserted into the [[uterus]], e.g. [[amniocentesis]], which can be done from about 14 weeks gestation, and usually up to about 20 weeks, and [[chorionic villus sampling]], which can be done earlier (between 9.5 and 12.5 weeks gestation) but which may be slightly more risky to the fetus. One study comparing transabdominal chorionic villus sampling with second trimester amniocentesis found no significant difference in the total pregnancy loss between the two procedures.&lt;ref name=Alfirevic&gt;[http://apps.who.int/rhl/reviews/langs/CD003252.pdf Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling for prenatal diagnosis (Review)]. By Alfirevic Z, Mujezinovic F, Sundberg K at [[The Cochrane Collaboration]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Chorionic villus sampling|transcervical]] chorionic villus sampling carries a significantly higher risk, compared with a second trimester amniocentesis, of total pregnancy loss ([[relative risk]] 1.40; 95% [[confidence interval]] 1.09 to 1.81) and spontaneous miscarriage (9.4% risk; relative risk 1.50; 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.11).&lt;ref name=Alfirevic/&gt;

Non-invasive techniques include examinations of the woman's womb through [[ultrasonography]] and maternal serum screens (i.e. [[Alpha-fetoprotein]]). Blood tests for select trisomies (Down syndrome in the United States, Down and Edwards syndromes in China) &lt;!-- as of October 2011 --&gt; based on detecting [[cell-free placental DNA]] present in maternal blood, also known as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), have become available.&lt;ref name=Palomaki&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Palomaki | first1 = G.

==Tests by pregnancy stage==

=== Pre-conception ===
Prior to conception, couples may elect to have genetic testing done to determine the odds of conceiving a child with a known genetic anomaly.  The most common in the caucasian population are:
* [[Cystic fibrosis]]
* [[Fragile X syndrome]]
* Blood disorders such as [[sickle cell disease]]
* [[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay-Sachs disease]]
* [[Spinal muscular atrophy]]
Hundreds of additional conditions are known and more discovered on a regular basis.  However the economic justification for population-wide testing of all known conditions is not well supported, particularly once the cost of possible false positive results and concomitant follow-up testing are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 4867464|year = 2016|last1 = Henneman|first1 = L|title = Responsible implementation of expanded carrier screening|journal = European Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 24|issue = 6|pages = e1–e12|last2 = Borry|first2 = P|last3 = Chokoshvili|first3 = D|last4 = Cornel|first4 = M.

J|last17 = Peterlin|first17 = B|pmid = 26980105|doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2015.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also ethical concerns related to this or any type of [[genetic testing]].

One or both partners may be aware of other family members with these diseases. Testing prior to conception may alleviate concern, prepare the couple for the potential short- or long-term consequences of having a child with the disease, direct the couple toward adoption or foster parenting, or prompt for [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|preimplantation genetic testing]] during [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilization]].  If a genetic disorder is found, professional [[genetic counseling]] is usually recommended owing to the host of ethical considerations related to subsequent decisions for the partners and potential impact on their extended families.  Most, but not all, of these diseases follow [[Mendelian inheritance]] patterns. [[Fragile X syndrome]] is related to expansion of certain repeated DNA segments and may change generation-to-generation.

=== First trimester ===
At early presentation of pregnancy at around 6 weeks, early dating ultrasound scan may be offered to help confirm the [[gestational age]] of the embryo and check for a single or twin pregnancy, but such a scan is unable detect common abnormalities. Details of prenatal screening and testing options may be provided.

Around weeks 11-13, [[nuchal scan|nuchal translucency scan]] (NT) may be offered which can be combined with blood tests for PAPP-A and beta-hCG, two serum markers that correlate with chromosomal abnormalities, -in what is called the First Trimester Combined Test.  The results of the blood test are then combined with the NT ultrasound measurements, maternal age, and gestational age of the fetus to yield a risk score for Down Syndrome, Trisomy 18, and Trisomy 13. First Trimester Combined Test has a sensitivity (i.e. detection rate for abnormalities) of 82–87% and a false-positive rate around 5%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170212001459/http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/pns/Documents/Provider%20Handbook%20%202009%20WEB.pdf The California Prenatal Screening Program]. cdph.ca.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second trimester ===
The [[anomaly scan]] is performed between 18–22 weeks of [[gestational age]]. The [[International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology]] (ISUOG) recommends that this ultrasound is performed as a matter of routine [[prenatal care]], to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy, and to assess for [[congenital malformations]] and [[Multiple birth|multiple pregnancies]] (i.e. twins).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salomon|first1=LJ|last2=Alfirevic|first2=Z|last3=Berghella|first3=V|last4=Bilardo|first4=C|last5=Hernandez-Andrade|first5=E|last6=Johnsen|first6=SL|last7=Kalache|first7=K|last8=Leung|first8=K.-Y.|last9=Malinger|first9=G|last10=Munoz|first10=H|last11=Prefumo|first11=F|last12=Toi|first12=A|last13=Lee|first13=W|title=Practice guidelines for performance of the routine mid-trimester fetal ultrasound scan|journal=Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol|date=2010|doi=10.1002/uog.8831|pmid=20842655|url=http://www.isuog.org/NR/rdonlyres/EA865840-6CA3-45AC-9E99-FBAF775119A9/0/ISUOGGuidelinesmidtriscan20101210.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2015|volume=37|issue=1|pages=116–126|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611205037/http://www.isuog.org/NR/rdonlyres/EA865840-6CA3-45AC-9E99-FBAF775119A9/0/ISUOGGuidelinesmidtriscan20101210.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scan can detect [[anencephaly]], open [[spina bifida]], [[cleft lip]], [[diaphragmatic hernia]], [[Gastroschisis|gastrochisis]], [[omphalocele]], [[congenital heart defect]], [[Renal agenesis|bilateral renal agenesis]], [[osteochondrodysplasia]], [[Edwards syndrome]], and [[Patau syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/anomaly-scan-18-19-20-21-weeks-pregnant.aspx|title=Mid-pregnancy anomaly scan - Pregnancy and baby - NHS Choices|last=NHS Choices|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second trimester [[Triple test#Quadruple test|Quad blood test]] may be taken (the [[Triple test]] is widely considered obsolete but in some states, such as Missouri, where Medicaid only covers the Triple test, that's what the patient typically gets). With ''integrated screening'', both a First Trimester Combined Test and a Triple/Quad test is performed, and a report is only produced after both tests have been analyzed. However patients may not wish to wait between these two sets of test. With ''sequential screening'', a first report is produced after the first trimester sample has been submitted, and a final report after the second sample. With ''contingent screening'', patients at very high or very low risks will get reports after the first trimester sample has been submitted. Only patients with ''moderate risk'' (risk score between 1:50 and 1:2000) will be asked to submit a second trimester sample, after which they will receive a report combining information from both serum samples and the [[nuchal translucency|NT]] measurement. The First Trimester Combined Test and the Triple/Quad test together have a sensitivity of 88–95% with a 5% false-positive rate for Down Syndrome, though they can also be analyzed in such a way as to offer a 90% sensitivity with a 2% false-positive rate. Finally for patients who do not receive an NT ultrasound in the 1st trimester may still receive a Serum Integrated test involving measuring PAPP-A serum levels in the 1st trimester and then doing a Quad test in the 2nd trimester.  This offers an 85–88% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate for Down Syndrome.  Also, patient may skip 1st trimester screening entirely and receive only a 2nd trimester Quad test, with an 81% sensitivity for Down Syndrome and 5% false-positive rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Third trimester ===
{{Empty section|date=December 2017}}

==Maternal serum screening==
First trimester maternal serum screening can check levels of free β-[[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], [[Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A|PAPP-A]], intact or beta hCG, or h-hCG in the woman's [[blood plasma|serum]], and combine these with the measurement of [[nuchal translucency]] (NT). Some institutions also look for the presence of a fetal nasalbone on the ultrasound.

Second trimester maternal serum screening ([[AFP screening]], triple screen, quad screen, or penta screen) can check levels of [[alpha fetoprotein]], β-[[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], [[inhibin]]-A, [[estriol]], and h-hCG (hyperglycosolated hCG) in the woman's [[blood plasma|serum]].

The [[triple test]] measures [[Blood serum|serum]] levels of [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]], [[estriol]], and [[beta-hCG]], with a 70% [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] and 5% [[false-positive]] rate.  It is complemented in some regions of the United States, as the ''Quad test'' (adding inhibin A to the panel, resulting in an 81% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate for detecting [[Down syndrome]] when taken at 15–18 weeks of [[gestational age]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lao|first1=M.R.|last2=Calhoun|first2=B. C.|last3=Bracero|first3=L. A.|last4=Wang|first4=Y.|last5=Seybold|first5=D. J.|last6=Broce|first6=M.|last7=Hatjis|first7=C.

The biomarkers [[PAPP-A]] and β-[[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] seem to be altered for pregnancies resulting from ICSI, causing a higher false-positive rate. Correction factors have been developed and
should be used when screening for Down’s syndrome in singleton pregnancies after ICSI,&lt;ref name="Gjerris2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gjerris|first1=A.

==Advances in prenatal screening==

Measurement of [[fetal protein]]s in maternal serum is a part of standard prenatal screening for [[Diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy|fetal aneuploidy]] and [[neural tube defects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|displayauthors=etal|date=July 2007|title=First- and second-trimester evaluation of risk for Down syndrome|journal=Obstet Gynecol|volume=110|issue=1|pages=10–7|doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000263470.89007.e3|pmid=17601890|vauthors=Ball RH, Caughey AB, Malone FD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dashe J.S., Twickler D.M., McIntire D.D., Ramus R.M.|last2=Twickler|last3=Santos-Ramos|last4=McIntire|last5=Ramus|year=2006|title=Alpha-fetoprotein Deduction of Neural Tube Defects and the Impact of Standard Ultrasound|url=http://rc.kfshrc.edu.sa/rcf/E_Library/NTDR/Alphafeto%20protein%20detection..pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology]]|volume=195|issue=6|pages=1623–1628|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2006.03.097|pmid=16769022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computational predictive model shows that extensive and diverse feto-maternal protein trafficking occurs during pregnancy and can be readily detected non-invasively in maternal [[whole blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maron JL, Alterovitz G, Ramoni M, Johnson KL, Bianchi DW|last2=Alterovitz|last3=Ramoni|last4=Johnson|last5=Bianchi|date=December 2009|title=High-Throughput Discovery and Characterization of Fetal Protein Trafficking in the Blood of Pregnant Women|journal=Proteomics: Clinical Applications|volume=3|issue=12|pages=1389–1396|doi=10.1002/prca.200900109|pmc=2825712|pmid=20186258}}&lt;/ref&gt; This computational approach circumvented a major limitation, the abundance of maternal proteins interfering with the detection of fetal proteins, to fetal proteomic analysis of maternal blood. Entering fetal gene transcripts previously identified in maternal whole blood into a computational predictive model helped develop a comprehensive proteomic network of the term neonate. It also shows that the fetal proteins detected in pregnant woman’s blood originate from a diverse group of tissues and organs from the developing fetus. Development proteomic networks dominate the functional characterization of the predicted proteins, illustrating the potential clinical application of this technology as a way to monitor normal and abnormal fetal development.

The difference in [[DNA methylation|methylation]] of specific DNA sequences between mother and fetus can be used to identify fetal-specific DNA in the blood circulation of the mother.  In a study published in March 6, 2011 online issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', using this non-invasive technique a group of investigators from Greece and UK achieved correct diagnosis of 14 [[trisomy 21]] ([[Down Syndrome]]) and 26 normal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Papageorgiou EA, Karagrigoriou A, Tsaliki E, Velissariou V, Carter NP, Patsalis PC|last2=Karagrigoriou|last3=Tsaliki|last4=Velissariou|last5=Carter|last6=Patsalis|date=April 2011|title=Fetal-specific DNA methylation ratio permits noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21|journal=Nat.

Based on its [[sensitivity and specificity]], it constitutes an advanced screening test and that positive results require confirmation by an invasive test, and that while effective in the diagnosis of Down syndrome, it cannot assess half the abnormalities detected by invasive testing. The test is not recommended for general use until results from broader studies have been reported, but may be useful in high-risk patients in conjunction with genetic counseling.&lt;ref name=ISPD /&gt;

A study in 2012 found that the maternal plasma cell-free DNA test was also able to detect Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) in 100% of the cases (59/59) at a false-positive rate of 0.28%, and Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) in 91.7% of the cases (11/12) at a false-positive rate of 0.97%. The test interpreted 99.1% of samples (1,971/1,988); among the 17 samples without an interpretation, three were Trisomy 18. The study stated that if z-score cutoffs for Trisomy 18 and 13 were raised slightly, the overall false-positive rates for the three aneuploidies could be as low as 0.1% (2/1,688) at an overall detection rate of 98.9% (280/283) for common aneuploidies (this includes all three trisomies- Down, Edwards and Patau).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Palomaki|first1=G.

{{cn span|text=Use of ultrasound for [[nuchal translucency]] will screen for [[aneuploidy]] such as [[Down Syndrome]] (Trisomy 21), Edwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18), and [[Patau Syndrome]] (Trisomy 13), whilst screens that only use serum markers will screen for Down Syndrome and Trisomy 18, but not Trisomy 13.  Considering that Trisomy 13 is extremely rare, maybe 1:5000 pregnancies and 1:16000 births, this difference is probably not significant. The AFP marker, whether alone or as part of the Quad test, can identify 80% of spina bifida, 85% of abdominal wall defects, and 97% of anencephaly.  Frequently women will receive a detailed 2nd trimester ultrasound in Weeks 18–20 (Morphology scan) regardless of her AFP level, which makes the AFP score unnecessary. Morphology ultrasound scans being undertaken on larger sized fetuses than in earlier scans, detect other structural abnormalities such as cardiac and renal tract abnormalities.| date=July 2015}}

Interphase-[[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH), [[quantitative PCR]] and [[Chorionic villus sampling|direct preparation of chromosomes from chorionic villi]] are all current methods being used that are the most effective for detecting fetal aneuploidy.&lt;ref name=Ref2&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00001703-200204000-00010|pmid=11914694|title=Developments in laboratory techniques for prenatal diagnosis|last=Miny|first=P|author2=Tercanli S |author3=Holzgreve W |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=April 2002|volume=14|issue=2|pages=161–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noninvasive techniques for detecting aneuploidy===
Due to the detection of fetal cells and fetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, noninvasive diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy is becoming more promising.&lt;ref name=Ref2/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlFetal Cells from Maternal Blood - A Powerful tool for Prenatal Diagnosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsite.fcmb.dk/index.php/fcmb-publications.html |title=Fetal Cells from Maternal Blood – A Powerful tool for Prenatal Diagnosis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308181947/http://newsite.fcmb.dk/index.php/fcmb-publications.html |archivedate=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a variety of screening methods for fetal aneuploidy and other chromosomal aberrations is now a prominent research area because of the discovery of circulating fetal [[nucleic acid]] in maternal [[blood plasma]]. However, the key problem is that circulating fetal nucleated cells comprise only three to six percent of maternal blood plasma DNA. Therefore, two effective approaches have been developed that can be used for the detection of fetal aneuploidy. The first involves the measuring of the [[allele|allelic ratio]] of [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) in the [[mRNA]] coding region in the [[placenta]]. The next approach is analyzing both maternal and fetal DNA and looking for differences in the [[DNA methylation]] patterns.&lt;ref name=Ref3&gt;{{cite journal|title=Noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies by maternal plasma nucleic acid analysis: a review of the current state of the art|last=Lo|first=YM|journal=BJOG|date=January 2009|volume=116|pages=152–7|pmid=19076946|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.02010.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cn span|text=Fetal cell DNA in maternal blood plasma is elevated in pregnancies complicated by fetal [[trisomy]] [[trisomy 21|21]], [[trisomy 13|13]] and [[trisomy 18|18]], making it easier to acquire enough sample sizes of maternal blood plasma to test for fetal aneuploidy.|date=July 2015}}

====Digital PCR====
Recently, it has been proposed that digital [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] can used for detection of fetal aneuploidy using fetal DNA and RNA found in maternal blood plasma. Research has shown that digital PCR can be used to differentiate between normal and aneuploid DNA using fetal DNA in the maternal blood plasma.&lt;ref name=Ref4&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pd.2150|title=Digital PCR: a powerful new tool for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis?|last=Zimmermann|first=BG|author2=Grill S |author3=Holzgreve W |author4=Zhong XY |author5=Jackson LG |author6=Hahn S |journal=Prenata Diagnostics|date=December 2008|volume=28|issue=12|pages=1087–93|pmid=19003785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the PCR technique called [[multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification]] (MLPA), targeting DNA, has been successively applied for diagnosing fetal aneuploidy as a chromosome- or gene-specific assay.&lt;ref name=Attie2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Go | first1 = A.

====Shotgun sequencing====
Fetal cell DNA has been directly sequenced using [[shotgun sequencing]] technology. This DNA was obtained from the blood plasma of eighteen pregnant women. This was followed by mapping the chromosome using the quantification of fragments. This was done using advanced methods in DNA sequencing resulting in the parallel sequencing of the fetal DNA. The amount of sequence tags mapped to each chromosome was counted. If there was a surplus or deficiency in any of the chromosomes, this meant that there was a fetal aneuploid. Using this method of shotgun sequencing, the successful identification of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome), and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) was possible. This method of noninvasive diagnosis is now starting to be heavily used and researched further.&lt;ref name=Ref1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0808319105|title=Noninvasive diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy by shotgun sequencing DNA from maternal blood|last=Fan|first=HC|author2=Blumenfeld YJ |author3=Chitkara U |author4=Hudgins L |author5=Quake SR |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date= October 21, 2008 |volume=105|issue=42|pages=16266–71|pmid=18838674|pmc=2562413|bibcode=2008PNAS..10516266F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other techniques====
Fetal components in samples from maternal blood plasma can be analyzed by genome-wide techniques not only by total DNA, but also by [[methylated DNA]] immunoprecipitation (with tiling array), [[microRNA]] (such as with Megaplex) and total RNA ([[RNA-sequencing]]).&lt;ref name=Attie2011/&gt;

====Patient acceptance====
Research was conducted to determine how women felt about noninvasive diagnosis of fetal aneuploid using maternal blood. This study was conducted using surveys. It was reported that eighty-two percent of pregnant women and seventy-nine percent of female medical students view this type of diagnosis in a positive light, agreeing that it is important for prenatal care. Overall, women responded optimistically that this form of diagnosis will be available in the future.&lt;ref name=Ref5&gt;{{cite journal|title=The attitude of women toward current and future possibilities of diagnostic testing in maternal blood using fetal DNA|last=Kooij|first=L|author2=Tymstra T |author3=Berg P |journal=Prenat Diagn|date=February 2009|volume=29|pages=164–8|pmid=19180577|issue=2|doi=10.1002/pd.2205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rarer conditions also detected===

{{Tone|section|date=July 2015}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

In addition to the direct seeking of chromosomal abnormalities and spina bifida, the blood tests can suggest additional conditions:
* Very low estriol level (part of Quad test) can indicate a risk of [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome]] (SLOS), an extremely rare (1:100,000) genetic disorder which can then only be confirmed with an amniocentesis. However, with a 0.3% false-positive rate, 300 women would be told they are at high-risk of SLOS for every 1 affected pregnancy.  Most physicians would agree that subjecting 300 women to an amniocentesis to diagnose 1 case of SLOS is not prudent.
* A low PAPP-A reading from a 1st Trimester serum test could also indicate a risk for pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or early fetal demise (i.e. miscarriage).  However, because PAPP-A only weakly correlates with these conditions and, in any case, there's little that one can do about them (except for pre-eclampsia, though that is better identified by other means), a PAPP-A test makes little sense except as a component of Down Syndrome screening.

==Ethical and practical issues==

===Ethical issues of prenatal testing===
* How to ensure that information about testing options is given in a non-directive, culturally appropriate, and supportive way.
*Parents need to make informed decisions about screening, diagnosis, and any actions to be taken as a result. Many screening tests are inaccurate, so one worrisome test result frequently leads to additional, more invasive tests. If prenatal testing confirms a serious disability, many parents are forced to decide whether to continue the pregnancy or seek an abortion.  The "option" of screening becomes an unexpected requirement to decide.  ''See'' [[wrongful abortion]].
*Are the risks of prenatal diagnosis through methods such as [[amniocentesis]] worth the potential benefit?
* Rarely, [[fetal intervention]] corrective procedures are possible, for rare birth defects such as [[spina bifida]] and [[teratoma]] before birth may give the option of [[fetal surgery]] during pregnancy, or assure that the appropriate treatment and/or surgery be provided immediately after birth.
* Questions about the intrinsic value of people with disabilities in society, and questions about whether it is appropriate to use [[Eugenics|eugenics-like]] solutions that reduce the number of babies born with disabilities.

=== Concerns from disability rights activists and scholars ===
Disability rights activists and scholars have suggested a more critical view of prenatal testing and its implications for people with disabilities. They argue that there is pressure to abort fetuses that might be born with disabilities, and that these pressures rely on eugenics interests and ableist stereotypes. This selective abortion relies on the ideas that people with disabilities cannot live desirable lives,that they are "defective," and that they are burdens, ignoring the fact that disability scholars argue that "oppression is what's most disabling about disability." Marsha Saxton suggests that women should question whether or not they are relying on real, factual information about people with disabilities or on stereotypes if they decide to abort a fetus with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Marsha. "Disability Rights and Selective Abortion." ''The Reproductive Rights Reader.'' Nancy Ehrenreich, Ed. New York City, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test results and the treatment of the fetus===
In some genetic conditions, for instance [[cystic fibrosis]], an abnormality can only be detected if DNA is obtained from the fetus. Usually an invasive method is needed to do this.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

If a genetic disease is detected, there is often no treatment that can help the fetus until it is born. However, in the US, there are prenatal surgeries for [[spina bifida]] fetus.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Early diagnosis gives the parents time to research and discuss post-natal treatment and care, or in some cases, abortion. [[Genetic counselors]] are usually called upon to help families make informed decisions regarding results of prenatal diagnosis.

===False positives and false negatives===
Ultrasound of a fetus, which is considered a screening test, can sometimes miss subtle abnormalities.  For example, studies show that a detailed 2nd trimester ultrasound, also called a level 2 ultrasound, can detect about 97% of neural tube defects such as [[spina bifida]] {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Ultrasound results may also show "soft signs," such as an [[Echogenic intracardiac focus]] or a [[Choroid plexus cyst]], which are usually normal, but can be associated with an increased risk for [[chromosome]] abnormalities.

Other screening tests, such as the Quad test, can also have false positives and false negatives.  Even when the Quad results are positive (or, to be more precise, when the Quad test yields a score that shows at least a 1 in 270 risk of abnormality), usually the pregnancy is normal, but additional diagnostic tests are offered.  In fact, consider that Down Syndrome affects about 1:400 pregnancies; if you screened 4000 pregnancies with a Quad test, there would probably be 10 Down Syndrome pregnancies of which the Quad test, with its 80% sensitivity, would call 8 of them high-risk.  The quad test would also tell 5% (~200) of the 3990 normal women that they are high-risk.  Therefore, about 208 women would be told they are high-risk, but when they undergo an invasive test, only 8 (or 4% of the high risk pool) will be confirmed as positive and 200 (96%) will be told that their pregnancies are normal.  Since amniocentesis has approximately a 0.5% chance of miscarriage, one of those 200 normal pregnancies might result in a miscarriage because of the invasive procedure.  Meanwhile, of the 3792 women told they are low-risk by the Quad test, 2 of them will go on to deliver a baby with Down Syndrome.  The Quad test is therefore said to have a 4% [[positive predictive value]] (PPV) because only 4% of women who are told they are "high-risk" by the screening test actually have an affected fetus.  The other 96% of the women who are told they are "high-risk" find out that their pregnancy is normal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

By comparison, in the same 4000 women, a screening test that has a 99% sensitivity and a 0.5% false positive rate would detect all 10 positives while telling 20 normal women that they are positive.  Therefore, 30 women would undergo a confirmatory invasive procedure and 10 of them (33%) would be confirmed as positive and 20 would be told that they have a normal pregnancy.  Of the 3970 women told by the screen that they are negative, none of the women would have an affected pregnancy.  Therefore, such a screen would have a 33% positive predictive value.  It's still unfortunate that 20 false-positive women have had to undergo an invasive procedure to find out they have a normal pregnancy, but it's still better than 200 false-positives with the Quad test.

The real-world false-positive rate for the Quad test (as well as 1st Trimester Combined, Integrated, etc.) is greater than 5%.  5% was the rate quoted in the large clinical studies that were done by the best researchers and physicians, where all the ultrasounds were done by well-trained sonographers and the gestational age of the fetus was calculated as closely as possible.  In the real world, where calculating gestational age may be a less precise art, the formulas that generate a patient's risk score are not as accurate and the false-positive rate can be higher, even 10%.

Because of the low accuracy of conventional screening tests, 5–10% of women, often those who are older, will opt for an invasive test even if they received a low-risk score from the screening.  A patient who received a 1:330 risk score, while technically low-risk (since the cutoff for high-risk is commonly quoted as 1:270), might be more likely to still opt for a confirmatory invasive test.  On the other hand, a patient who receives a 1:1000 risk score is more likely to feel assuaged that her pregnancy is normal.

Both [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]]s and [[Type I and type II errors|false negative]]s will have a large impact on a couple when they are told the result, or when the child is born. [[medical diagnosis|Diagnostic]] tests, such as amniocentesis, are considered to be very accurate for the defects they check for, though even these tests are not perfect, with a reported 0.2% error rate (often due to rare abnormalities such as mosaic Down Syndrome where only some of the fetal/placental cells carry the genetic abnormality).

A higher [[Alpha-fetoprotein|maternal serum AFP]] level indicates a greater risk for anencephaly and open spina bifida.  This screening is 80% and 90% sensitive for spina bifida and anencephaly, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Amniotic fluid [[acetylcholinesterase]] and [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]] level are more [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] and [[sensitivity and specificity|specific]] than AFP in predicting neural tube defects.

Many maternal-fetal specialists do not bother to even do an AFP test on their patients because they do a detail ultrasound on all of them in the 2nd trimester, which has a 97% detection rate for neural tube defects such as anencephaly and open spina bifida. Performing tests to determine possible birth defects is mandatory in all [[U.S. state]]s. Failure to detect issues early can have dangerous consequences on both the mother and the baby. [[OBGYN]]s may be held culpable. In one case a man who was born with spina fibia was awarded $2 million in settlement, apart from medical expenses, due to the OBGYN's negligence in conducting AFP tests.&lt;ref name="Fibia"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boothkoskoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/spina_bifida.pdf |title=Medical malpractice: Childbirth, failed to perform AFP test}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No prenatal test can detect ''all'' forms of birth defects and abnormalities.

===Societal pressures on prenatal testing decisions===
Amniocentesis has become the standard of care for prenatal care visits for women who are "at risk" or over a certain age. The wide use of amniocentesis has been defined as consumeristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henn |first=W. |title=Consumerism in Prenatal Diagnosis: A Challenge for Ethical Guidelines |journal=[[Journal of Medical Ethics|J Med Ethics]] | date=Dec 2000 |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=444–6 |doi=10.1136/jme.26.6.444 |pmid=11129845 |pmc=1733311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some argue that this can be in conflict with the right to privacy,&lt;ref&gt;Botkin JR. Fetal privacy and confidentiality. Hastings Cent Rep. 1995 Sep–Oct;25(5):32–9&lt;/ref&gt; Most obstetricians (depending on the country) offer patients the AFP [[triple test]], [[HIV]] test, and ultrasounds routinely.  However, almost all women meet with a [[genetic counselor]] before deciding whether to have prenatal diagnosis.  It is the role of the genetic counselor to accurately inform women of the risks and benefits of prenatal diagnosis. Genetic counselors are trained to be non-directive and to support the patient's decision. Some doctors do advise women to have certain prenatal tests and the patient's partner may also influence the woman's decision.

===Informed consent and medical malpractice===
{{Globalize/US|section|date=December 2010}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
Obstetricians have an ethical duty to properly inform patients of their options, specifically the availability of screening and diagnostic testing.  Physicians have been successfully sued by women who gave birth to babies with abnormalities that could have been detected had they known about their screening options, though the plaintiff must also prove that she would have elected to terminate the pregnancy in the event of a positive finding.  Also, physicians who fail to inform their patients of the risks of amniocentesis and CVS might be found guilty of negligence informed consent in the event that the patient sues after a procedure-related miscarriage or fetal damage.

There is a misconception that a physician only needs to do what other physicians typically do (i.e. standard of care).  However, in the case of informed consent, the legal standard is more commonly defined as what a reasonable patient would elect to do if she is informed.  So if a reasonable patient would want to be screened if only she is informed or if a reasonable patient would want to receive an amniocentesis if only she is informed of that option, then a physician is legally obligated to inform the patient of these options.

As newer, more accurate screening tests emerge, physicians may need to quickly get up to speed on the most recent data and start informing their patients of the existence of these tests.  Failure to inform patients of the available of these more accurate screening tests might result in a wrongful birth or wrongful miscarriage lawsuit if the patient can demonstrate that she would have chosen the newer test, if she had known about it, to avoid the unfortunate outcome that resulted from receiving a conventional screening test or invasive procedure.

=== Prenatal screening and maternal anxiety ===
Researchers have studied how disclosing aminocentesis or [[Chorionic villus sampling|chorionic villous sampling]] (CVS) results on a fixed date versus a variable date (i.e. "when available") affects maternal anxiety. Systematic review of the relevant articles found no conclusive evidence to support issuing aminocentesis results as soon as they become available (in comparison to issuing results on a pre-defined fixed date). The researchers concluded that further studies evaluating the effect of different strategies for disclosing CVS results on maternal anxiety are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mujezinovic|first=Faris|last2=Prosnik|first2=Anica|last3=Alfirevic|first3=Zarko|date=2010-11-10|title=Different communication strategies for disclosing results of diagnostic prenatal testing|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=11|pages=CD007750|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007750.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=21069696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21967">In [[global health]], '''priority-setting''' is a term used for the process and strategy of deciding which health interventions to carry out. Priority-setting can be conducted at the disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate), the overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]]), research level (i.e. which health research to carry out),&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt; or other levels.&lt;ref name=durand /&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Definitions==

Priority-setting is the act of deciding which health interventions to carry out, and can occur at several levels of granularity. Priority-setting can occur at the following levels:&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=durand /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="pmac2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/CallForAbstract.pdf |title=Call for Abstracts: Priority Setting for Universal Health Coverage |accessdate=June 23, 2016 |publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Conference 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* health budget level (i.e. deciding how much to spend on health overall)
* overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]])
* disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate)
* intervention level within each disease (i.e. restricting to a specific disease and prioritizing among interventions for that disease)
* drug level
* research level (i.e. which health research to carry out)

Synonymous terms include "prioritization in health care and health research", "priority determination", "health priorities",&lt;ref name=rudan2010/&gt; and "agenda-setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 370| issue = 9595| pages = 1370–1379| last1 = Shiffman| first1 = Jeremy| last2 = Smith| first2 = Stephanie| title = Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality| journal = The Lancet| accessdate = 2016-07-26| date = 2007| url = http://www.who.int/pmnch/topics/advocacy/JShiffman-globalsmarticle-Lancet.pdf| doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61579-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metrics==

Various metrics have been used to compare interventions. These include:

* [[Disability-adjusted life year]] per unit cost (used by e.g. [[Disease Control Priorities Project]]),&lt;ref name=rudan2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="glassman2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.gheart.2012.01.007| issn = 2211-8160| volume = 7| issue = 1| pages = 13–34| last1 = Glassman| first1 = Amanda| last2 = Chalkidou| first2 = Kalipso| last3 = Giedion| first3 = Ursula| last4 = Teerawattananon| first4 = Yot| last5 = Tunis| first5 = Sean| last6 = Bump| first6 = Jesse B.| last7 = Pichon-Riviere| first7 = Andres| title = Priority-Setting Institutions in Health| journal = Global Heart| accessdate = 2016-06-23| date = March 2012| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211816012000105}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quality-adjusted life year]], and other forms of [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]

* Adequacy of funding&lt;ref name=dcp2_ch4 /&gt;

==Who sets the priorities?==

Priority-setting can be done by various actors. These include:

* Governments: "In most countries, health spending by governments vastly outpaces international health aid, so governments set most health priorities."&lt;ref name="glassman2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Glassman%2011-13-13%20(public).pdf |title=A conversation with Amanda Glassman on November 13, 2013 |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=June 21, 2016 |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Non-profits and companies that assist governments
* If a country is using a [[Health in All Policy]] (HiAP) approach, then priority-setting is done by stakeholders who do not directly deal with health.&lt;ref name=pmac2016/&gt;
* International organizations
* Foundations
* Private donors (including [[high-net-worth individual]]s and ultra-high-net-worth individuals): "A common outcome is a negotiated set of priorities that reflect some domestic needs and some technical, political, and economic considerations defined largely by the interests of donors."&lt;ref name=glassman2012/&gt; In some highly aid-dependent countries, donors "have huge influence on health priorities".&lt;ref name=glassman2013/&gt;

According to Devi Sridhar, professor of global health at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cphs.mvm.ed.ac.uk/people/staffProfile.php?profile=dsridhar |date=September 30, 2015 |title=Centre for Population Health Sciences - People |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the priorities of funding bodies largely dictate what health issues and diseases are studied".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001312| issn = 1549-1676| volume = 9| issue = 9| pages = –1001312| last = Sridhar| first = Devi| title = Who Sets the Global Health Research Agenda?

==History of organizations and programs working on priority-setting==

According to [[Amanda Glassman]] et al., global-level priority-setting has occurred since at least the 1980s, though these efforts have only focused on a few aspects.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;

The following table is a timeline of organizations and programs working on priority-setting.

&lt;!-- Merge info from [[University_of_Toronto_Joint_Centre_for_Bioethics#Priority_Setting]]:

Priority setting, or resource allocation, is an important health policy issue that occurs at all levels of health care. The Joint Centre for Bioethics shares its research platform on priority setting with the Canadian Priority Setting Research Network, which aims to improve the politics and processes of health care priority setting and enhance the research capacity for priority setting. The centre takes an innovative approach to priority setting research in that the focus is placed on enhancing the priority setting processes, capturing and sharing actual priority setting experiences, and taking a bottom-up approach to improve priority setting.

==Reception==

{{cquote|text=The result of a myriad of actors championing a kaleidoscope of "priorities" is confusion. Advocates, researchers, and policy makers have labeled almost every disease, condition, medication, or intervention a "health priority."|author=Glassman et al.&lt;ref name=glassman2012/&gt;}}

Rudan et al. says that priority-setting efforts have relied on "consensus reached by panels of experts" and as a result have not been systematic enough, and that this has "often made it difficult to present the identified priorities to wider audiences as legitimate and fair".&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt;

[[Amanda Glassman|Glassman]] et al. notes that criticisms of priority-setting include "the weak data on which estimates of burden, cost, and effectiveness relied; the value judgments implicit in disability-adjusted life year age weighting and discounting decisions; and treatment of equity issues, as well as the political difficulties associated with translating a ground zero package into a public budget based on historical inputs"; and the consideration of only health maximization at the expense of other objectives such as fairness.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;{{rp|16}}

Glassman et al. also notes how there are more cost-effectiveness studies for LMICs (in the thousands), but that these are unlikely to be actually applied to priority-setting processes.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;{{rp|16}}

[[Jeremy Shiffman]] has said that some bodies such as the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and ''[[The Lancet]]'' are prominent in priority-setting due to their dominion rather than data and analysis, and also notes that the process of creating the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] was not sufficiently transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.15171/ijhpm.2015.51| issn = 2322-5939| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 315–317| last = Levine| first = Ruth E.| title = Power in global health agenda-setting: the role of private funding| journal = International Journal of Health Policy and Management| date = 2015-03-04| pmid = 25905483| pmc = 4417636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47807">'''Psychological trauma''' is a type of damage to the [[mind]] that occurs as a result of a distressing event. Trauma is often the result of an overwhelming amount of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] that exceeds one's ability to cope, or integrate the [[emotion]]s involved with that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|title=Trauma Definition|work=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805161505/http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may result from a single distressing experience or recurring events of being overwhelmed that can be precipitated in weeks, years, or even decades as the person struggles to cope with the immediate circumstances, eventually leading to serious, long-term negative consequences.

Because trauma differs between individuals, according to their subjective experiences, people will react to similar traumatic events differently. In other words, not all people who experience a potentially traumatic event will actually become psychologically traumatized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Storr CL, Ialongo NS, Anthony JC, Breslau N|year=2007|title=Childhood antecedents of exposure to traumatic events and post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=164|issue=1|pages=119–25|pmid=17202553|doi=10.1176/ajp.2007.164.1.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for some people to develop [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]) after being exposed to a major traumatic event.&lt;ref name=":01"&gt;"Among individuals who do develop post-traumatic stress after exposure to a traumatic event, some develop symptoms sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD"

This discrepancy in risk rate can be attributed to [[protective factor]]s some individuals may have that enable them to cope with trauma; they are related to temperamental and environmental factors from among others. Some examples are mild exposure to stress early in life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fenoglio KA, Chen Y, Baram TZ|year=2006|title= Neuroplasticity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis early in life requires recurrent recruitment of stress-regulation brain regions|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=26|issue=9|pages=2434–2442|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4080-05.2006|pmid=16510721|pmc=2408688}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychological resilience|resilience]] characteristics, and active seeking of help.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wingo, Aliza P, Ressler KJ, Bradley B|year=2014|title=Resilience characteristics mitigate tendency for harmful alcohol and illicit drug use in adults with a history of childhood abuse: A cross-sectional study of 2024 inner-city men and women|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=51|pages=93–99|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.01.007|pmid=24485848|pmc=4605671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)]] defines trauma as direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, or injury experienced by a family member or close associate. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the [[in vivo]] environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|title=DSM-IV-TR – DSM Library|publisher=|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma can be caused by a wide variety of events, but there are a few common aspects. There is frequently a violation of the person's core assumptions about the world and their [[human rights]], putting the person in a state of extreme [[Mental confusion|confusion]] and insecurity. This is seen when institutions depended upon for survival violate, humiliate, [[Betrayal Trauma|betray]], or cause major losses or separations instead of evoking aspects like positive self worth, safe boundaries and personal freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=DePrince, A.P.|author2=Freyd, J.J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|chapter=The Harm of Trauma: Pathological fear, shattered assumptions, or betrayal?|editor=J.

Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme [[poverty]] or other forms of [[abuse]], such as [[verbal abuse]], exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.

Parts of the brain in a growing child are developing in a sequential and hierarchical order, from least complex to most complex. The brain's neurons are designed to change in response to the constant external signals and stimulation, receiving and storing new information. This allows the brain to continually respond to its surroundings and promote survival.

Childhood abuse tends to have the most complications with long-term effects out of all forms of trauma because it occurs during the most sensitive and critical stages of psychological development.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"/&gt; It could also lead to violent behavior, possibly as extreme as serial murder. For example, Hickey's Trauma-Control Model suggests that "[[Childhood trauma|childhood trauma]] for serial murderers may serve as a triggering mechanism resulting in an individual's inability to cope with the stress of certain events."&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, E.

Often psychodynamic aspects of trauma are overlooked even by health professionals: "If clinicians fail to look through a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may fail to see that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Psychological Trauma on Children and Adolescents|url=http://mentalhealth.vermont.gov/sites/dmh/files/report/cafu/DMH-CAFU_Psychological_Trauma_Moroz.pdf|format=PDF|date=June 30, 2005|author=Moroz, Kathleen J.|publisher=Vermont Agency of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
People who go through these types of extremely traumatic experiences often have certain symptoms and problems afterward. The severity of these symptoms depends on the person, the type of trauma involved, and the emotional support they receive from others.  The range of reactions to and symptoms of trauma can be wide and varied, and differ in severity from person to person. A traumatized individual may experience one or several of them.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

After a traumatic experience, a person may '''re-experience''' the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called [[Trauma trigger|triggers]], can be uncomfortable and even painful. Re-experiencing can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, as well as their ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events are recurring. Flashbacks can range from distraction to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing of symptoms is a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.

Triggers and cues act as reminders of the trauma and can cause [[anxiety]] and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases this may lead a person suffering from traumatic disorders to engage in disruptive behaviors or self-destructive coping mechanisms, often without being fully aware of the nature or causes of their own actions. [[Panic attack]]s are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.

Consequently, intense feelings of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may always seem to be present due to re-experiencing past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]]s may haunt the person, and [[nightmare]]s may be frequent.&lt;ref name="Loyola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|title=Loyola College in Maryland: Trauma and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028034430/http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|archivedate=2005-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insomnia]] may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions, but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generation, thus making genetics one of the components of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frommberger|first=Ulrich|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder – a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person may not remember what actually happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see [[Repressed memory|Repressed Memory]]). This can lead to the traumatic events being constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. This can lead to mental health disorders like [[acute stress disorder|acute stress]] and anxiety disorder, [[traumatic grief]], [[undifferentiated somatoform disorder]], [[conversion disorder]]s, [[brief psychotic disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], adjustment disorder, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rothschild B|title=The body remembers: the psychophysiology of trauma and trauma treatment |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-393-70327-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, emotional exhaustion may set in, leading to distraction, and clear thinking may be difficult or impossible. [[Emotional detachment]], as well as [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] or "numbing out" can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment. This is significant in brain scan studies done regarding higher order function assessment with children and youth who were in vulnerable environments.

Some traumatized people may feel permanently damaged when trauma symptoms do not go away and they do not believe their situation will improve. This can lead to feelings of despair, transient paranoid ideation,  loss of [[self-esteem]], profound emptiness, suicidality, and frequently [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. If important aspects of the person's self and world understanding have been violated, the person may call their own identity into question.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/facts/general/fs_effects.html |title=Effects of Traumatic Experiences: A National Center for PTSD Fact Sheet |accessdate=2005-12-09 |last=Carlson |first=Eve B. |author2=Josef Ruzek  |publisher=National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder |doi= |archiveurl=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/factsheets/effects |archivedate=2004-06-12 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often despite their best efforts, traumatized parents may have difficulty assisting their child with emotion regulation, attribution of meaning, and containment of post-traumatic fear in the wake of the child's traumatization, leading to adverse consequences for the child.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Coates SW, Kaminer T, Coots T, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Schonfield IS, Marshall RD, Liebowitz MR, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Myers MM|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author2link=Susan Coates|year=2008|title=Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers|journal=Journal of Trauma and Dissociation|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–149|doi=10.1080/15299730802045666|pmid=18985165|pmc=2577290}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances, seeking counselling in appropriate mental health services is in the best interests of both the child and the parent(s).
==Cause==

===Situational trauma===
Trauma can be caused by man-made, technological disasters and natural disasters,&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"&gt;Neria, Y., Nandi, A., &amp; Galea, S. (2008). Post-traumatic stress disorder following disasters: a systematic review. Psychological medicine, 38(4), 467–480. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; including war, abuse, violence, mechanized accidents (car, train, or plane crashes, etc.) or medical emergencies.

Responses to psychological trauma:
Response to psychological trauma can be varied based on the type of trauma, as well as socio demographic and background factors.&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"/&gt;
There are several behavioral responses common towards stressors including the proactive, reactive, and passive responses. Proactive responses include attempts to address and correct a stressor before it has a noticeable effect on lifestyle.  Reactive responses occur after the stress and possible trauma has occurred and are aimed more at correcting or minimizing the damage of a stressful event.  A passive response is often characterized by an emotional numbness or ignorance of a stressor.

Those who are able to be proactive can often overcome stressors and are more likely to be able to cope well with unexpected situations.  On the other hand, those who are more reactive will often experience more noticeable effects from an unexpected stressor. In the case of those who are passive, victims of a stressful event are more likely to suffer from long-term traumatic effects and often enact no intentional coping actions. These observations may suggest that the level of trauma associated with a victim is related to such independent coping abilities.

There is also a distinction between trauma induced by recent situations and long-term trauma which may have been buried in the unconscious from past situations such as [[childhood abuse]]. Trauma is sometimes overcome through healing; in some cases this can be achieved by recreating or revisiting the origin of the trauma under more psychologically safe circumstances, such as with a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]].

===In psychoanalysis===
{{main article|Psychoanalysis}}

French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] argued in the 1890s that psychological trauma was the origin of all instances of the mental illness known as [[hysteria]].  Charcot's "traumatic hysteria" often manifested as a paralysis that followed a physical trauma, typically years later after what Charcot described as a period of "incubation".
[[Sigmund Freud]], Charcot's student and the father of [[psychoanalysis]], examined the concept of psychological trauma throughout his career.  [[Jean Laplanche]] has given a general description of Freud's understanding of trauma, which varied significantly over the course of Freud's career: "An event in the subject's life, defined by its intensity, by the subject's incapacity to respond adequately to it and by the upheaval and long-lasting effects that it brings about in the psychical organization".&lt;ref name = Laplanche&gt;{{cite book |author1=Laplanche, J.  |author2=Pontalis, J.B. | year=1967 | title=The Language of Psycho-Analysis | publisher=W. W. Norton and Company | isbn=978-0-393-01105-0  | pages=465–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] claimed that what he called "[[The Real]]" had a traumatic quality external to symbolization. As an object of anxiety, Lacan maintained that The Real is "the essential object which isn't an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety ''par excellence''".&lt;ref name="seminar_II"&gt;Lacan, J., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954–1955'' | p.164 (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1991), {{ISBN|978-0-393-30709-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress disorders===
{{main article|Posttraumatic stress disorder|Complex post-traumatic stress disorder}}
All psychological traumas originate from stress, a physiological response to an unpleasant stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|title=Physiology of Psychology|author=Carlson, Neil|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossarth-Maticek, R., Eysenck, H.J., &amp; Boyle, G.J. (1994). An empirical study of the diathesis-stress theory of disease. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 1'', 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Long term stress increases the risk of poor mental health and mental disorders, which can be attributed to secretion of glucocorticoids for a long period of time. Such prolonged exposure causes many physiological dysfunctions such as the suppression of the immune system and increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seyle, H.|title=The Stress of Life|journal=McGraw Hill|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does it affect the body physiologically, but a morphological change in the hippocampus also takes place. Studies showed that extreme stress early in life can disrupt normal development of hippocampus and impact its functions in adulthood. Studies surely show a correlation between the size of hippocampus and one's susceptibility to stress disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunson|title=Mechanisms of late-onset cognitive decline after early-life stress|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=2005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of war, psychological trauma has been known as shell shock or [[combat stress reaction]]. Psychological trauma may cause an [[acute stress reaction]] which may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  PTSD emerged as the label for this condition after the [[Vietnam War]] in which many veterans returned to their respective countries demoralized, and sometimes, addicted to psychoactive substances. The symptoms of PTSD must persist for at least a month for diagnosis. The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. continuous scanning of the environment for danger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frommberger, Ulrich|year=2014|title=Post-traumatic stress disorder – a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|volume=111|issue=5|pages=59–65|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2014.0059|pmid=24612528|pmc=3952004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives, but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"/&gt; Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.

The term ''continuous post traumatic stress disorder'' (CTSD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straker|first=Gillian|title=The continuous traumatic stress syndrome: The single therapeutic interview|journal=Psychology and Society|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.

As one of the processes of treatment, confrontation with their sources of trauma plays a crucial role. While debriefing people immediately after a critical incident has not been shown to reduce incidence of PTSD, coming alongside people experiencing trauma in a supportive way has become standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNally RJ |author2=Bryant RA |author3=Ehlers A | title=Does early psychological intervention promote recovery from posttraumatic stress? | journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume=4 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=45–79| doi = 10.1111/1529-1006.01421|pmid=26151755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vicarious===
Vicarious trauma affects workers who witnesses their clients' trauma. It is more likely to occur in situations where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and seeing oneself in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2008/phac-aspc/H72-21-178-2000E.pdf|title=Guidebook on Vicarious Trauma: Recommended Solutions for Anti-Violence Workers|publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may also result if workers witness situations that happen in the course of their work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dr-john-bradford-won-t-work-magnotta-case-because-of-ptsd-1.2571463|title=Russell Williams profiler won't work Magnotta case because of PTSD|publisher=CBC|date= March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of help seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.

==Assessment==

As "trauma" adopted a more widely defined scope, traumatology as a field developed a more interdisciplinary approach. This is in part due to the field's diverse professional representation including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers. As a result, findings in this field are adapted for various applications, from individual psychiatric treatments to sociological large-scale trauma management. However, novel fields require novel methodologies. While the field has adopted a number of diverse methodological approaches, many pose their own limitations in practical application.

The experience and outcomes of psychological trauma can be assessed in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Briere, John |author2=Scott, Catherine |title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |location=California |year=2006 |pages=37–63 |isbn=978-0-7619-2921-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk of imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will not be necessary to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual's [[social support]] network are much more critical.

Understanding and accepting the psychological state an individual is in is paramount. There are many misconceptions of what it means for a traumatized individual to be in psychological crisis. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and incapable of self-comfort. If treated humanely and respectfully the individual is less likely to resort to self harm. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and to communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance, the individual will be taken seriously rather than being treated as delusional. It is vital for the assessor to understand that what is going on in the traumatized person's head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., post-traumatic symptoms, dissociation, [[substance abuse]], somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established [[rapport]] and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.

During assessment, individuals may exhibit activation responses in which reminders of the traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., [[distress (medicine)|distress]], anxiety, [[anger]]), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because individuals may not yet be capable of managing this distress, it is necessary to determine how the event can be discussed in such a way that will not "retraumatize" the individual. It is also important to take note of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible post traumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is important to note the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).

In addition to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual's strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense [[depressive episode]]s, or [[self-mutilation]]. The information gathered through observation of affect regulation will guide the clinician's decisions regarding the individual's readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.

Though assessment of psychological trauma may be conducted in an unstructured manner, assessment may also involve the use of a structured interview. Such interviews might include the [[Clinician Administered PTSD Scale|Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale]] (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; Bryant, Harvey, Dang, &amp; Sackville, 1998), Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; Pelcovitz et al., 1997), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders- Revised (SCID-D; Steinberg, 1994), and Brief Interview for post-traumatic Disorders (BIPD; Briere, 1998).

Lastly, assessment of psychological trauma might include the use of self-administered psychological tests. Individual scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual's level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might include the use of generic tests (e.g., [[MMPI-2]], [[MCMI-III]], SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess post-traumatic outcomes. Such tests might include the post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS: Davidson et al., 1997), Detailed Assessment of post-traumatic Stress (DAPS; Briere, 2001), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI: Briere, 1995), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, 1996), Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ: Kubany et al., 2000), and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory (TRGI: Kubany et al., 1996).

Children are assessed through activities and therapeutic relationship, some of the activities are play genogram, sand worlds, coloring feelings, Self and Kinetic family drawing, symbol work, dramatic-puppet play, story telling, Briere's TSCC, etc.&lt;ref name="GilATC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliana Gil|title=Helping Abused and Traumatized Children: Integrating Directive and Nondirective Approaches|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qe-E0CYLDqcC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60918-474-2|pages=28, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A number of psychotherapy approaches have been designed with the treatment of trauma in mind—[[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]], [[progressive counting (PC)]], [[somatic experiencing]], [[biofeedback]], [[Internal Family Systems Model|Internal Family Systems Therapy]], and [[sensorimotor psychotherapy]].

Trauma therapy allows processing trauma-related memories and allows growth towards more adaptive psychological functioning. It helps to develop positive coping instead of negative coping and allows the individual to integrate upsetting-distressing material (thoughts, feelings and memories) and to resolve these internally. It also aids in growth of personal skills like resilience, ego regulation, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFMXBAAAQBAJ|title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment (DSM-5 Update)|first1=John N.|last1=Briere|first2=Catherine|last2=Scott|date=25 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483351254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes involved in trauma therapy are:

* Psychoeducation: Information dissemination and educating in vulnerabilities and adoptable coping mechanisms.
* Emotional regulation: Identifying, countering discriminating, grounding thoughts and emotions from internal construction to an external representation.
* Cognitive processing: Transforming negative perceptions and beliefs about self, others and environment to positive ones through cognitive reconsideration or re-framing.
* Trauma processing: Systematic desensitization, response activation and counter-conditioning, titrated extinction of emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (in theory, to a state in which triggers no longer produce harmful distress and the individual is able to express relief.)
* Emotional processing: Reconstructing perceptions, beliefs and erroneous expectations, habituating new life contexts for auto-activated trauma-related fears, and providing crisis cards with coded emotions and appropriate cognitions. (This stage is only initiated in pre-termination phase from clinical assessment and judgement of the mental health professional.)
* [[Gestalt therapy|Experiential]] processing: Visualization of achieved relief state and relaxation methods.

A number of complementary approaches to trauma treatment have been implicated as well, including yoga and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Basant|last2=Kluewer D’Amico|first2=Jessica|last3=Makani|first3=Ramkrishna|last4=Parikh|first4=Tapan|date=2015-07-10|title=Nonconventional interventions for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder: Ketamine, repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and alternative approaches|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35–54|doi=10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|issn=1529-9732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trauma-sensitive yoga]] has been specifically developed for the purposes of use with traumatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emerson|first=D.|last2=Sharma|first2=R.|last3=Chaudhry|first3=S.|last4=Turner|first4=J.|date=2009|title=Trauma-sensitive yoga: principles, practice, and research|url=|journal=International Journal of Yoga Therapy|volume=19|pages=123-128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16108">'''Public health surveillance''' (also '''epidemiological surveillance''', '''clinical surveillance''' or '''syndromic surveillance''') is, according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), "the continuous, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data needed for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of [[public health]] practice."&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;[http://www.who.int/topics/public_health_surveillance/en/ Public health surveillance], [[World Health Organization]] (accessed January 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Public health surveillance may be used to "serve as an early warning system for impending public health emergencies; document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and monitor and clarify the [[epidemiology]] of health problems, to allow priorities to be set and to inform [[public health policy]] and strategies."&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

Public Health surveillance systems can be passive or active. A passive surveillance system consists of the regular, ongoing reporting of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory. An active surveillance system is one where health facilities are visited and health care providers and medical records are reviewed in order to identify a specific disease or condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Passive surveillance systems are less time-consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=World Health Organization|title=Surveillance for Vaccine Preventable Diseases|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/VPDs/en/|website=World Health Organization: Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques of public health surveillance have been used in particular to study [[infectious diseases]]. Many large institutions, such as the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], have created databases and modern computer systems ([[public health informatics]]) that can track and monitor emerging outbreaks of illnesses such as [[influenza]], [[SARS]], [[HIV]], and even [[bioterrorism]], such as the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States.

Many regions and countries have their own [[cancer registry]], one function of which is to monitor the incidence of cancers to determine the prevalence and possible causes of these illnesses.

Other illnesses such as one-time events like [[stroke]] and chronic conditions such as [[diabetes]], as well as social problems such as domestic violence, are increasingly being integrated into [[epidemiologic]] databases called disease registries that are being used in the [[cost-benefit analysis]] in determining governmental funding for research and prevention.

Systems that can automate the process of identifying adverse drug events, are currently being used, and are being compared to traditional written reports of such events.&lt;ref name="pmid16622159"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kilbridge PM, Campbell UC, Cozart HB, Mojarrad MG | title=Automated Surveillance for Adverse Drug Events at a Community Hospital and an Academic Medical Center | journal=J Am Med Inform Assoc | date= Jul–Aug 2006 | volume= 13 | issue= 4 | pages= 372–7 | pmid=16622159 | doi=10.1197/jamia.M2069 | pmc=1513675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems intersect with the field of medical informatics, and are rapidly becoming adopted by hospitals and endorsed by institutions that oversee healthcare providers (such as [[JCAHO]] in the United States). Issues in regard to healthcare improvement are evolving around the surveillance of medication errors within institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ritpo.satx.disa.mil/ContentStore/ProvonostDec03.pdf disa.mil] PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndromic surveillance==
{{See also|Disease surveillance}}
Syndromic surveillance is the analysis of medical data to detect or anticipate [[disease]] [[outbreak]]s. According to a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] definition, "the term 'syndromic surveillance' applies to surveillance using health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response. Though historically syndromic surveillance has been utilized to target investigation of potential cases, its utility for detecting outbreaks associated with [[bioterrorism]] is increasingly being explored by public health officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/EPO/dphsi/syndromic.htm |title=webcitation.org |publisher=webcitation.org |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5LKEYsrRT |archivedate=December 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first indications of disease outbreak or [[bioterrorist]] attack may not be the definitive diagnosis of a [[physician]] or a lab.

Using a normal [[influenza]] outbreak as an example, once the outbreak begins to affect the population, some people may call in sick for work/school, others may visit their drug store and purchase medicine over the counter, others will visit their doctor's office and other's may have symptoms severe enough that they call the [[emergency telephone number]] or go to an [[emergency department]].

Syndromic surveillance systems monitor data from school absenteeism logs, emergency call systems, hospitals' over-the-counter drug sale records, Internet searches, and other data sources to detect unusual patterns.  When a spike in activity is seen in any of the monitored systems disease [[epidemiologists]] and public health professionals are alerted that there may be an issue.

An early awareness and response to a [[Bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] attack could save many lives and potentially stop or slow the spread of the outbreak. The most effective syndromic surveillance systems automatically monitor these systems in real-time, do not require individuals to enter separate information (secondary data entry), include advanced analytical tools, aggregate data from multiple systems, across geo-political boundaries and include an automated alerting process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/epo/dphsi/syndromic.htm United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] ([https://www.webcitation.org/5LKEYsrRT WebCited/cached version])&lt;/ref&gt;

A syndromic surveillance system based on search queries was first proposed by [[Gunther Eysenbach]], who began work on such a system in 2004.&lt;ref name="pmid17238340"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Eysenbach G| title=Infodemiology: Tracking Flu-Related Searches on the Web for Syndromic Surveillance | journal=AMIA Annu Symp Proc | year= 2006 | volume=  2006| issue=  | pages= 244–8 | pmid=17238340 | pmc=1839505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Inspired by these early, encouraging experiences, [[Google]] launched [[Google Flu Trends]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.org/flutrends/ |title=Google Flu Trends |publisher=Google.org |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008. More [[flu]]-related searches are taken to indicate higher flu activity. The results closely match [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] data, and lead it by 1–2 weeks. The results appeared in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]].&lt;ref name="pmid19020500"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ginsberg J, Mohebbi MH, Patel RS, Brammer L, Smolinski MS, Brilliant L | title=Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data | journal=Nature | year= 2009 | volume= 457 | issue= 7232 | pages= 1012–4| pmid=19020500| doi=10.1038/nature07634| bibcode=2009Natur.457.1012G }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a series of more advanced linear and nonlinear approaches to influenza modelling from Google search queries have been proposed.&lt;ref name=NSR&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lampos |first=Vasileios |last2=Miller |first2=Andrew C. |last3=Crossan |first3=Steve| last4=Stefansen |first4=Christian |date=3 Aug 2015 |title=Advances in nowcasting influenza-like illness rates using search query logs |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |issue=12760|pages=12760 | doi=10.1038/srep12760 |pmid=26234783 |pmc=4522652|bibcode=2015NatSR...512760L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extending [[Google]]'s work researchers from the Intelligent Systems Laboratory ([[University of Bristol]], UK) created Flu Detector;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geopatterns.enm.bris.ac.uk/epidemics |title= Flu Detector – Tracking Epidemics on Twitter |publisher=GeoPatterns.enm.bris.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online tool which based on [[Information Retrieval]] and [[Statistical Analysis]] methods uses the content of [[Twitter]] to nowcast flu rates in the UK.&lt;ref name="lamposFlu2010"&gt;{{cite conference|vauthors=Lampos V, De Bie T, Cristianini N | title=Flu Detector – Tracking Epidemics on Twitter | conference=ECML PKDD | year=2010 | pages=599–602 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-15939-8_42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influenzanet==
[[Influenzanet]] is a syndromic surveillance system based on voluntary reports of symptoms via the internet. Residents of the participant countries are invited to provide regular reports on the presence or absence of flu related symptoms. The system has been in place and running since 2003 in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The success of this first initiative led to the implementation of Gripenet in Portugal in 2005 followed by [[Italy]] in 2008 and [[Brasil]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United Kingdom]] in 2009.

==Laboratory-based surveillance==
Some conditions, especially chronic diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]], are supposed to be routinely managed with frequent laboratory measurements. Since many laboratory results, at least in Europe and the US, are automatically processed by computerized laboratory information systems, the results are relatively easy to inexpensively collate in special purpose databases or disease registries.  Unlike most syndromic surveillance systems, in which each record is assumed to be independent of the others, laboratory data in chronic conditions can be theoretically linked together at the individual patient level. If patient identifiers can be matched, a chronological record of each patient's laboratory results can be analyzed as well as aggregated to the population level.

Laboratory registries allow for the analysis of the incidence and prevalence of the target condition as well as trends in the level of control. For instance, an [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]-funded program called the Vermedx Diabetes Information System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vermedx.com |title=vermedx.com |publisher=vermedx.com |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained a registry of laboratory values of diabetic adults in Vermont and northern New York State in the US with several years of laboratory results on thousands of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/96/4/593 |title=MacLean CD, Littenberg B, Gagnon M.

Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. Out of control test results generated a letter to the patient suggesting they take action with their medical provider. Tests that were overdue generated reminders to have testing performed. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. Clinical and economic evaluations of the system, including a large randomized [[clinical trial]], demonstrated improvements in adherence to practice guidelines and reductions in the need for emergency department and hospital services as well as total costs per patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Littenberg|first=B |author2=MacLean, CD |author3=Zygarowski, K |author4=Drapola, BH |author5=Duncan, JA |author6=Frank, CR|title=The Vermedx Diabetes Information System reduces healthcare utilization.|journal=The American journal of managed care|date=Mar 2009|volume=15|issue=3|pages=166–70|pmid=19298097|url=http://www.ajmc.com/issue/managed-care/2009/2009-02-vol15-n3/AJMC_09Mar_Littenberg166to170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maclean|first=CD|author2=Gagnon, M|author3=Callas, P|author4=Littenberg, B|title=The Vermont diabetes information system: a cluster randomized trial of a population based decision support system.|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=Dec 2009|volume=24|issue=12|pages=1303–10|pmid=19862578|doi=10.1007/s11606-009-1147-x|pmc=2787948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=S |author2=Maclean, CD |author3=Littenberg, B|title=The effect of the Vermont Diabetes Information System on inpatient and emergency room use: results from a randomized trial.|journal=Health outcomes research in medicine|date=Jul 2010|volume=1|issue=1|pages=e61–e66|pmid=20975923|doi=10.1016/j.ehrm.2010.03.002|pmc=2958673}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been commercialized and distributed to physicians, insurers, employers and others responsible for the care of chronically ill patients. It is now being expanded to other conditions such as [[chronic kidney disease]].

A similar system, The New York City A1C Registry,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/diabetes/diabetes-nycar.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609163243/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/diabetes/diabetes-nycar.shtml|date=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in used to monitor the estimated 600,000 diabetic patients in [[New York City]], although unlike the Vermont Diabetes Information System, there are no provisions for patients to have their data excluded from the [[New York City|NYC]] database. The [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] has linked additional patient services to the registry such as health information and improved access to health care services.  As of early 2012, the registry contains over 10 million test results on 3.6 million individuals. Although intended to improve health outcomes and reduce the incidence of the complications of diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/extract/98/9/1543 |title=Frieden, Thomas R; "Letter: New York City's Diabetes Reporting System Helps Patients and their Physicians"; ''American Journal of Public Health''; July 16, 2006 |publisher=Ajph.aphapublications.org |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a formal evaluation has not yet been done.

In May 2008, the City Council of [[San Antonio, Texas]] approved the deployment of an A1C registry for [[Bexar County]]. Authorized by the Texas Legislature and the state Health Department, the  San Antonio Metropolitan Health District&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanantonio.gov/health/ |title=Metropolitan Health District |publisher=Sanantonio.gov |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented the registry which drew results from all the major clinical laboratories in San Antonio. The program was discontinued in 2010 for lack of funds.

Laboratory surveillance differs from population-wide surveillance in that it can only monitor patients who are already receiving medical treatment and therefore having lab tests done. For this reason, it does not identify patients who have never been tested. Therefore, it is more suitable for quality management and care improvement than for epidemiological monitoring of an entire population or catchment area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30483">The developmental life stage of dogs requires a specific intake of nutrients to ensure proper growth and development and to meet energy requirements. Despite the fact that [[puppies]] have different nutritional requirements compared to their adult counterparts, of the 652 breeders surveyed in the United States and Canada in 2012, 8.7% report feeding puppies commercial diets not intended for the developmental life stage of canines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connolly|first=K.M.|last2=Heinze|first2=C.R.|last3=Freeman|first3=L.M.|year=2014|title=Feeding practices of dog breeders in the United States and Canada|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=245|pages=669–676|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.245.6.669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large and small dog breeds have even more specific nutrient requirements during growth, such as adjusted calcium to phosphorus ratio, and as such should receive a breed specific growth formula.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobenecker|first=B.|year=2004|title=Apparent calcium absorption in growing dogs of two different sizes|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=134|pages=21515–21535|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeding diets formulated by a nutritionist for specific breed and life stage differences in nutrient requirements ensures a growing puppy will receive the proper nutrition associated with appropriate skeletal, neurological and immune development.

The nutritional requirements determined by the NRC are based on scientific evidence and used as the basis for nutritional adequacy in cats and dogs. However, these values are based on the assumption that the availability and digestibility of the nutrients are not variable, although in reality, this is not the case.  The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) also has recommended nutrient levels, but their values serve primarily as regulatory guidance. AAFCO bases their recommendations on feeding trials and are not necessarily supported by scientific evidence; however their nutritional adequacy statement on pet food bags is considered an important part of the label because their recommendations account for ingredient variability. Other agencies involved in pet food regulations include the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in the United States who directly regulates the sales of pet food, the FEDIAF in Europe and PFIAA in Australia who recommend regulatory requirements for the pet food industry, as well as others. When selecting puppy food, it is important to consult the labels and ensure products meet the standards of regulatory agencies of your respective country.

== Energy ==
Young growing dogs require greater amounts of [[Food energy|energy]] per unit body mass than fully grown adult dogs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=G.|last2=Grandjean|first2=D.|last3=Paragon|first3=B.|year=1998|title=Calculation of a dietary plan for puppies|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition|volume=80|pages=54–59|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0396.1998.tb00501.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; From time of weaning until the puppy reaches 40% of the adult body weight, the optimal energy intake per unit body weight is twice that of an adult dog of the same breed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; From 40% to 80% of adult body weight, energy requirements decrease to 1.6 times the adult requirement, and from 80% to the end of growth, this decreases further to 1.2 times the adult energy requirement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because of this, it is important to ensure that puppy diets contain higher amounts of energy than adult dog foods. However, over nutrition associated with feeding ''ad libitum'' results in accelerated skeletal growth and weight gain leading to osteopenia, especially in large breed dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dammrich|first=K.|year=1991|title=Relationship between nutrition and bone growth in large and giant dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=121|pages=114–121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, appropriate energy requirements should be met, but not exceeded in the growing dog.

Owners and puppy raisers should monitor their puppy’s weight gain by referencing a 9-point body condition score scale which is easily accessible on the internet, regularly weighing the puppy, and consulting with their veterinarian. Owners should also be mindful as to the energy level of their puppy; high energy level puppies will require more energy and may need to be fed extra amounts of food, just as lower energy puppies may require less food. The 9 point body condition score has been shown to be an effective method for estimating percent body fat in dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mawby|first=D.I.|last2=Bartges|first2=J.W.|last3=d'Avignon|first3=A.|last4=Laflamme|first4=D.P.|last5=Moyers|first5=T.D.|last6=Cottrell|first6=T.|year=2004|title=Comparison of various methods for estimating body fat in dogs|url=|journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association|volume=40|pages=109–114|via=|doi=10.5326/0400109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by adhering to the 9 point body condition scale, and adjusting food intake accordingly, owners will be able to maintain their puppy at an appropriate weight throughout its growth. In addition to visual estimates of body condition, physical [[palpation]] of the pet can provide insight on general health and weight. Speaking to a licensed veterinarian can be very beneficial, as they can help develop these dietary and weight monitoring skills.

== Calcium and Phosphorus ==
An important aspect of the composition of puppy food is the [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]] content. Bone mineral is composed mainly of calcium, which functions in skeletal mineralization during growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Puppies younger than 5 months are not able to adjust the absorption of calcium in response to intake, therefore an oversupply or undersupply can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobenecker|first=B.|year=2002|title=The influence of calcium and phosphorus intake on the apparent digestibility of these minerals in growing dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=132|pages=16655–16675|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When raised on diets deficient in calcium, pathological bone fractures can result.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tryfonidou|first=M.A.|last2=Holl|first2=M.S.|last3=Vastenburg|first3=M.|last4=Oosterlaken-Dijksterhuis|first4=M.A.|last5=Birkenhager-Frenkel|first5=D.H.|last6=van den Brom|first6=W.E.|last7=Hazewinkel|first7=H.A.|year=2003|title=Hormonal regulation of calcium homeostasis in two breeds of dogs during growth at different rates|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=81|pages=1568–1580|via=|doi=10.2527/2003.8161568x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fractures have been shown to occur in smaller breed puppies when their diet contained less than 0.33% calcium on a dry matter (DM) basis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Larger breeds present with fractures at a calcium level of less than 0.55%, thus requiring these breeds to have greater calcium requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazewinkel|first=H.W.|last2=van den Brom|first2=W.|last3=Van't Klooster|first3=A.|last4=Voorhout|first4=G.|last5=Van Wees|first5=A.|year=1991|title=Calcium metabolism in Great Dane dogs fed diets with various calcium and phosphorus levels|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=121|pages=99S-106S|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ratio of calcium to phosphorus greatly impacts the retention of phosphorus. A ratio of 1.3:1 will allow for good phosphorus retention, but levels above a ratio of 2:1 will decrease phosphorus retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoenmakers|first=I.|last2=Hazewinkel|first2=H.|last3=Brom|first3=W.|year=1999|title=Excessive Ca and P intake during early maturation in dogs alters Ca and P balance without long-term effects after dietary normalization|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=129|pages=1068–1074|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raising puppies on diets containing excess calcium and phosphorus will result in [[osteochondrosis]] which disturbs bone remodeling and cartilage and bone maturation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goedegebuure|first=S.A.|last2=Hazewinkel|first2=H.A.|year=1986|title=Morphological findings in young dogs chronically fed a diet containing excess calcium|url=|journal=Veterinary Pathology|volume=23|pages=594–605|via=|doi=10.1177/030098588602300508}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are noticed in larger breed puppies at lower levels of excess than in smaller breeds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because large breed puppies are more sensitive to deficient and excess calcium and phosphorus levels, it is important to ensure that their diets contain sufficient amounts of both.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The minimum requirement laid out by the NRC is 8.0g/kg DM calcium (0.8%), with a 12g/kg DM (1.2%) recommended allowance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, recommendations laid out by AAFCO consist of slightly higher calcium values; 1.2% to 1.8% on a DM basis, whereas phosphorus levels should be between 1.0% and 1.6%, with a ratio of calcium to phosphorus between 1:1 and 2:1.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafco.org/Portals/0/SiteContent/Regulatory/Committees/Pet-Food/Reports/Pet_Food_Report_2013_Midyear-Proposed_Revisions_to_AAFCO_Nutrient_Profiles.pdf|title=AAFCO methods for substantiating nutritional adequacy of dog and cat foods|last=|first=|date=2014|website=AAFCO|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many commonly used ingredients, such as corn, which are added in high amounts to commercial dog foods do not contain adequate amounts of calcium, and as such, calcium supplements are often added to the formulation to ensure proper amounts for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortin|first=W.G.N.|last2=Yu|first2=P.|year=2009|title=Nutrient variation and availability of wheat DDGS, corn DDGS and blend DDGS from bioethanol plants|url=|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume=89|pages=1757–1761|via=|doi=10.1002/jsfa.3652}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a descriptive study of over-the-counter maintenance dog foods determined that 4/45 of the foods studied contained calcium concentrations that exceeded the AAFCO recommendation, but were labeled for all life stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagne|first=J.W.|last2=Wakshlag|first2=J.J.|last3=Center|first3=S.A.|last4=Rutzke|first4=M.A.|last5=Glahn|first5=R.P.|year=2013|title=Evaluation of calcium, phosphorus, and selected trace mineral status in commercially available dry foods formulated for dogs|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=243|pages=658–666|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.243.5.658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is important to feed a diet specifically recommended for the developmental life stage and consult the calcium and phosphorus levels in puppy foods.

== Fats and Fatty Acids ==
Fat is a nutrient that provides more energy per gram than all other nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canine and Feline Nutrition: A Resource for Companion Animal Professionals|last=Case|first=L.P.|last2=Daristotle|first2=L.|last3=Hayek|first3=M.J.|last4=Raasch|first4=M.F.|publisher=Mosby|year=2000|isbn=|location=St. Louis, MO, USA|pages=17–19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat provides 9.4kcal/g of gross energy (GE) compared to protein and carbohydrate which only provide 5.56 and 4.15 kcal/g respectively.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Due to this greater energy concentration and the higher energy demand of puppies, the higher fat content of canine development diets helps reach these increased energy requirements while also providing the [[essential fatty acid]]s necessary for the growing dog. [[Omega-3 fatty acid|Omega-3]] (n-3) fatty acids are an important component of puppy diets. Multiple studies suggest brain and retinal function are dependent on the level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids acquired during in utero development and postnatal life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=J.E.|last2=Heinemann|first2=K.M.|last3=Lees|first3=G.E.|last4=Waldron|first4=M.K.|year=2006|title=Retinal functions of young dogs are improved and maternal plasma phospholipids are altered with diets containing long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during gestation, lactation, and after weaning|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=136|pages=1991–1994|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinemann|first=K.M.|last2=Bauer|first2=J.E.|year=2006|title=Docosahexaenoic acid and neurologic development in animals|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=228|pages=700–705|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.228.5.700}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]] is the main n-3 fatty acid and can be obtained as DHA itself from dietary sources such as fish and fish oils, or as the DHA precursor linolenic acid.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With a high DHA intake, plasma lipid DHA content increases, aiding neurological development, as demonstrated by increases in memory and learning ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other benefits of n-3 and DHA include promotion of neurogenesis, increased neuron size and phospholipid synthesis, as well as protection against cell death and peroxidative brain damage by damaging [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=P.C.|last2=O'Kusky|first2=J.R.|last3=Innis|first3=S.M.|year=2006|title=Maternal dietary (n-3) fatty acid deficiency alters neurogenesis in the embryonic rat brain.|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=136|pages=1570–1575|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/136.6.1570}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the rodent model and presumably across the mammalian kingdom. A deficit of dietary n-3 fatty acids leads to a reduction in brain DHA content by 50-80%, leading to cognitive deficits and increased n-6 fatty acid level which increases inflammation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Adequate intake and recommended allowance levels of 85g/kg (DM) of total fat (8.5%), and 0.5g/kg (DM) of omega 3 fatty acids (EPA+DHA) are laid out by the NRC.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both of these values are also laid out as recommendations by AAFCO. However, according to a study on the effects of supplementing DHA in puppy diets, diets containing 1.4% n-3 fatty acids, or 0.19% DHA resulted in optimal neurological function.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vitamin E ==
Along with DHA, [[vitamin E]] also supports the proper development of eyesight, reduces oxidative damage, and provides additional immune function support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During instances of immune system stimulation, such as vaccinations and infection, immune cells generate more tissue damaging free radicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These free radicals are reduced by the action of antioxidants such as vitamin E, which promote the formation and maintenance of healthy immune cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The adequate intake level laid out by the NRC consists of 24&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (36 IU/kg) of vitamin E, with a recommended allowance of 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (45 IU/kg).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the regulatory guidance laid out by AAFCO states a vitamin E minimum recommendation of 50 IU/kg DM. Nonetheless, these values have been shown to be insufficient for immune protection; immune function is best optimized at a level of 500 IU/kg.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to prevention of free radical damage, this higher level of vitamin E greatly increases the number of memory [[Memory T cell|CD4+ immune cells]], aiding in a greater and a longer response to infection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to their still-developing immune system, puppies are more susceptible to infection than adult dogs, and proper levels of vitamin E, as indicated above, are needed in their diet.

== Fibre ==
Although young growing dogs have immature gastrointestinal tracts, they do contain [[Microbiota|microflora]] which can ferment [[Dietary fiber|fibre]] and generate [[Short-chain fatty acid|short chain fatty acids]] beneficial to gut health.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=S.|last2=Fahey|first2=G.|last3=Corbin|first3=J.|last4=Pugh|first4=J.|last5=Franklin|first5=R.|year=1981|title=Evaluation of byproduct feedstuffs as dietary ingredients for dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=53|pages=1538–1544|via=|doi=10.2527/jas1982.5361538x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silvio|first=J.|last2=Harmon|first2=D.L.|last3=Gross|first3=K.L.|last4=McLeod|first4=K.R.|year=2000|title=Influence of fiber fermentability on nutrient digestion in the dog|url=|journal=Nutrition|volume=16|pages=289–295|via=|doi=10.1016/s0899-9007(99)00298-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonization and establishment of these bacterial populations happens over time, beginning immediately after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buddington|first=R.K.|year=2003|title=Postnatal changes in bacterial populations in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=64|pages=646–651|via=|doi=10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the ability for fermentation, addition of fibre to the diet should be done carefully, as fibre will dilute other nutrients in the feed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delorme|first=C.B.|last2=Barrette|first2=D.|last3=Monean|first3=R.|last4=Lariviere|first4=R.|year=1985|title=The effect of dietary fibre on feed intake and growth in beagle puppies|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Comparative Medicine|volume=49|pages=278|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different types of fibre, all are made of carbohydrates, and NRC classifies them into fermentable and non-fermentable carbohydrates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fermentable carbohydrates are generally 3-10 monosaccharide units joined by glycosidic bonds which cannot be degraded by endogenous enzymes and require the fermentation processes of intestinal microflora for proper degradation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Non-fermentable fibres are carbohydrate structures which are not fully fermented even by intestinal microflora. Little research has been done on non-fermentable fibre, however it is known that it causes fecal bulking and reduced intestinal transit time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It has been shown that addition of non-fermentable fibre in concentrations of 22% or greater of the total diet will reduce growth, feed intake and feed efficiency.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Fermentable fibre is more beneficial for growing puppies, and it is often considered a prebiotic, meaning it supports the growth of beneficial microflora species in the intestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=G.R.|last2=Roberfroid|first2=M.B.|year=1995|title=Dietary modulation of the human colonic microbiota: Introducing the concept of prebiotics|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=125|pages=1401–1412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermentable fibre often contains [[Fructooligosaccharide|fructo-oligosaccharides]] (FOS) and [[Mannan oligosaccharide-based nutritional supplements|mannanoligosaccharides]] (MOS), both of which greatly stimulate gut health.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson|first=K.S.|last2=Grieshop|first2=C.M.|last3=Flickinger|first3=E.A.|last4=Healy|first4=H.P.|last5=Dawson|first5=K.A.|last6=Merchen|first6=N.R.|last7=Fahey Jr.|first7=G.C.|year=2002|title=Effects of supplemental fructooligosaccharides plus mannanoligosaccharides on immune function and ileal and fecal microbial populations in adult dogs|url=|journal=Archives of Animal Nutrition|volume=46|pages=309–318|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOS are fermented by beneficial bacteria such as [[Bifidobacterium|bifidobacteria]] promoting their growth, while most pathogenic bacterial strains such as E. coli, C. perfringens and Salmonella are unable to ferment it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS has been shown to stimulate the immune system and increase resistance to pathogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Beet pulp is generally the standard fermentable fibre used in canine diets, however blends of fermentable fibre sources have been shown to be as effective at promoting gut health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middelbos|first=I.S.|last2=Fastinger|first2=N.D.|last3=Fahey|first3=G.C.|year=2007|title=Evaluation of fermentable oligosaccharides in diets fed to dogs in comparison to fiber standards|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=85|pages=3033–3044|via=|doi=10.2527/jas.2007-0080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fermentable fibre is extremely beneficial, it should still be added in moderate amounts as addition of fermentable fibre to a concentration of 14.1% or greater will result in lower digestibility of the feed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Protein ==
Growing puppies require higher levels of [[protein]] than adult dogs of the same breed to promote proper growth and development.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Case|first=L.P.|last2=Czarnecki-Maudlen|first2=G.L.|year=1990|title=Protein requirements of growing pups fed practical dry-type diets containing mixed-protein sources|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=51|pages=808–812|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein should account for at least 25% of energy; however protein requirements also depend on the digestibility of the protein and age of the puppy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Amino acid]] and nitrogen requirements decrease between 10–14 weeks, indicating that different protein levels are often beneficial before and after 14 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before 14 weeks of age, a protein level of 250 g/kg of diet (25% of the diet) containing 4.0 kcal ME/g will result in optimal growth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ontko|first=J.A.|last2=Wuthier|first2=R.E.|last3=Phillips|first3=P.H.|year=1957|title=The effect of increased dietary fat upon the protein requirement of the growing dog|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=62|pages=163–169|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/62.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 14 weeks of age, protein requirements decrease to 200 g/kg of diet (20% of the diet) for optimal growth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gessert|first=C.F.|last2=Phillips|first2=P.H.|year=1956|title=Protein in the nutrition of the growing dog|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=123|pages=610–625|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burns|first=R.A.|last2=Milner|first2=J.A.|year=1982|title=Threonine, tryptophan and histidine requirements of immature beagle dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=112|pages=447–452|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/112.3.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delaney|first=S.J.|last2=Hill|first2=A.S.|last3=Backus|first3=R.C.|last4=Czarnecki-Maulden|first4=G.L.|last5=Rogers|first5=Q.R.|year=2001|title=Dietary crude protein concentration does not affect the leucine requirements of growing dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition|volume=85|pages=88–100|via=|doi=10.1046/j.1439-0396.2001.00306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein in excess of these levels is metabolized and leads to an increase of the glomerular filtration rate, and increased [[urea]] excretion in the urine, with no evidence of damage to the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nap|first=R.C.|last2=Hazewinkel|first2=H.A.|last3=Voorhout|first3=G.|last4=Van den Brom|first4=W.E.|last5=Goedegebuure|first5=S.A.|last6=Van'T Klooster|first6=A.T.|year=1991|title=Growth and skeletal development in Great Dane pups fed different levels of protein intake|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=121|pages=107–113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, addition of protein past these requirements is not recommended, although the NRC has not quantified a safe upper limit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Considering that the energy density of protein is similar to that of carbohydrates, an excess of protein in the diet may lead to fat deposition and weight gain.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This excess weight can lead to abnormal joint development, potentially giving rise to joint issues in the future.

== Iodine ==
To date, there is little information available about minimum requirements of dietary iodine for developing puppies. However, literature suggests that overdosage of iodine in puppies has deleterious effects on the thyroid gland.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castillo|first=V.A.|last2=Lalia|first2=J.C.|last3=Junco|first3=M.|last4=Sartorio|first4=G.|last5=Marquez|first5=A.|last6=Rodriguez|first6=M.S.|last7=Pisarev|first7=M.A.|year=2001|title=Changes in thyroid function in puppies fed a high iodine commercial diet|url=|journal=The Veterinary Journal|volume=161|issue=80-84|pages=|via=|doi=10.1053/tvjl.2000.0523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castillo|first=V.A.|last2=Pisarev|first2=M.A.|last3=Lalia|first3=J.C.|last4=Cabrini|first4=R.L.|last5=Marquez|first5=A.G.|year=2001|title=Nutrition: commercial diet induced hypothyroidism due to high iodine.

The NRC states an adequate intake and recommended allowance of 900 μg/kg (DM) which translates into 220μg/1000 kcal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These values have been shown in multiple studies to be the recommended maximum allowance of iodine that would result in no abnormalities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norris|first=W.|last2=Fritz|first2=T.|last3=Taylor|first3=J.A.|year=1970|title=Cycle of accommodation to restricted dietary iodine in thyroid gland of the beagle dog|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=31|pages=21–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belshaw|first=B.|last2=Cooper|first2=T.|last3=Becker|first3=D.|year=1975|title=The iodine requirement and influence of iodine intake on iodine metabolism and thyroid function in the adult beagle|url=|journal=Endocrinology|volume=96|pages=1280–1291|via=|doi=10.1210/endo-96-5-1280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
Canine development diets are designed specifically to meet the energy demands and nutritional requirements for healthy growth. Proper nutrition is imperative to support development of bones, joints, muscles, and the immune system, and includes the addition of nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, calcium, fibre, vitamin E, and others. Ensuring optimal energy intake allows the diet to meet the high energy demands of puppies while avoiding over nutrition, over-accelerated growth, and unhealthy weight gain. Dietary fats also help to meet these high energy demands and provide the essential fatty acids necessary for brain, neuron, and retinal development and function.  Since growing puppies require greater amounts of protein than their adult counterparts, it is important to include the appropriate amounts to support healthy development. Correct levels of both fermentable and non-fermentable fibre help to support GI and immune health. During growth, young dogs are more susceptible to infection, but the addition of proper levels of vitamin E to the diet reduces free radical oxidative damage and leads to an increase in immunity. Calcium and phosphorus, in the appropriate amounts and ratio, aid in proper bone and cartilage growth and maturation. It is imperative to be aware of the levels of other minerals as well, as the over-dosage of iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, and the delay in maturation and development of bones. It is therefore important to feed a diet that meets the nutrient minimum and/or maximum requirements established by the National Research Council in order to ensure optimal growth and development of young dogs of all breeds.

{{Race}}

'''Race and health''' refers to the relationship between individual [[health]] and one's [[race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Differences in health status, health outcomes, [[life expectancy]], and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups are well documented, and referred to as racial [[health disparities]]. Some individuals in certain racial groups receive less care, have less access to resources, and live shorter lives in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalter-Roth |title=Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans |website=asanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Race is a complex concept, and the two major competing theories of race use biological definitions and social construction to define racial difference. A "race" is also viewed as physically distinguishable populations that share a common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalter-Roth |first1=Roberta |title=Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans |website=asanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this relationship can vary depending on the definitions used, race is generally used in the context of health research as a fluid concept to group populations of people according to various factors that include but are not limited to ancestry, social [[Identity (social science)|identity]], visible [[phenotype]], and [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=171|author=National Human Genome Research Institute|title=Race|work=Talking Glossary of Genetic Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Determinants of health include environmental, social, and genetic factors, as well as the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"&gt;[[World Health Organization]]. [http://www.who.int/hia/evidence/doh/en/ ''The determinants of health'']. Geneva. Accessed 12 May 2011 (which are inter-related with all three, but mostly social factors).&lt;/ref&gt; Race and medicine are related additionally by how environmental factors and physiological factors respond to each other. Additionally, how genetic needs coerce with environmental standings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1047-2797(97)00051-3 |pmid=9250627 |title=Race and health: Basic questions, emerging directions |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=322–33 |year=1997 |last1=Williams |first1=David R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health disparities ==
Health disparities refer to gaps in the quality of health and [[health care]] across racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), [[Healthy People 2010]]: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000).{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] defines health disparities as "population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Janet |last1=Goldberg |first2=William |last2=Hayes |first3=Jill |last3=Huntley |date=November 2004 |title=Understanding Health Disparities |publisher=Health Policy Institute of Ohio |url=http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010615/http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Health is measured through variables such as life expectancy and incidence of diseases.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Collins |first=Francis S. |title=What we do and don't know about 'race', 'ethnicity', genetics and health at the dawn of the genome era |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=36 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=S13–S15 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15507997 |doi=10.1038/ng1436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How researchers view race is often linked to how we address racial disparities because the national administrator of health uses these research findings to implement policies.&lt;ref name="library.brown.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.brown.edu/reserves/pdffiles/34469_Whitmarsh_Vernaculars.pdf|title=Brown University Authentication for Web-Based Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining race ==
{{main|Race (human categorization)}}

There are various paradigms used to discuss race, including biological and social views. Definitions have changed throughout history to yield a modern understanding of race that is complex and fluid. Moreover, there is no one definition that stands, as there are many competing and interlocking ways to look at race.&lt;ref name="library.brown.edu"/&gt; The terms race, genetic population, ethnicity, geographic population, and ancestry are used interchangeably in everyday discourse involving race.

Biological definitions of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not universally accept a single definition of race. Essentialism is a mode of thought that uses scientific data to argue that racial groups are genetically distinct populations. Essentialists describe "races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, aka use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences".&lt;ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Morning/|title=On Distinction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that "race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach About Human Difference|chapter=Chapter 4: Teaching Race|author=Ann Morning|p=114|year=2011|publisher= University of California Press |doi=10.1525/j.ctt1pnrht |isbn=978-0-520-27031-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social definitions are commonly constructionist. Racial groups are "constructed" from differing historical, political, and economic contexts, rather than corresponding to inherited, biological variations. Proponents of the constructionist view claim that biological definitions have been used to justify racism in the past and still have the potential to be used to encourage racist thinking in the future.&lt;ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"/&gt;

Social views also better explain the ambiguity of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social interpretations of race]]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rds.epi-ucsf.org/ticr/syllabus/courses/23/2012/03/29/Lecture/readings/The%20Importance%20of%20Race%20&amp;%20Ethnicity%20in%20Biomedical%20Research%20and%20Clinical%20Practice..pdf|title=Training in Clinical Research Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment.

==Race and disease==
There are a myriad of factors that affect health disparities between racial groups. Among these factors are genetic differences within racial populations, cultural [[mores]], and social and environmental factors. For instance, in some populations where perceptions of race are linked with socioeconomic disparities and differences, the access to care can be considerably lesser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=D R|last2=Lavizzo-Mourey|first2=R|last3=Warren|first3=R C|date=1994-01-01|title=The concept of race and health status in America.|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=109|issue=1|pages=26–41|issn=0033-3549|pmc=1402239|pmid=8303011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dually, bias in healthcare systems themselves can perpetuate non-biologically founded higher instances of disease. A study conducted by the [[National Health Service]] checks program in the United Kingdom, which aims to increase diagnosis across demographics, noted that "the reported lower screening in specific black and minority ethnic communities... may increase inequalities in health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Ruth|last2=Coghill|first2=Nikki|last3=Montgomery|first3=Alan|last4=Feder|first4=Gene|last5=Horwood|first5=Jeremy|date=2015-12-10|title=The provision of NHS health checks in a community setting: an ethnographic account|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=15|pages=546|doi=10.1186/s12913-015-1209-1|issn=1472-6963|pmc=4676171|pmid=26651487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this specific case, the lack of attention to certain demographics can be seen as a cause of increased instances of disease from this lack of proper, equal preventative care. One must consider these external factors when evaluating statistics on the prevalence of disease in populations, even though genetic components can play a role in predispositions to contracting some illnesses. These linkages should be more closely evaluated than by ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Carol R.|last2=Davis|first2=Margaret H.|last3=Palermo|first3=Ann-Gel S.|last4=Vladeck|first4=Bruce C.|date=2000-01-01|title=Approaches to Eliminating Sociocultural Disparities in Health|journal=Health Care Financing Review|volume=21|issue=4|pages=57–74|issn=0195-8631|pmc=4194638|pmid=11481745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, health disparities, which include variations in life expectancy and prevalence of disease, due to the differences in health conditions across various ethnic populations that can be attributed to inequalities in living environment and access to healthcare may also play a role.

===Single-gene disorders===
{{See also|Genetic disorder}}
There are many single gene [[genetic disorder]]s that differ in frequency between different populations due to the region, though many assume it to be solely based on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=YF|last2=Goldstein|first2=DB|last3=Angrist|first3=M|last4=Cavalleri|first4=G|title=Personalized medicine and human genetic diversity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine|date=24 July 2014|volume=4|issue=9|pages=a008581|pmid=25059740|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a008581|pmc=4143101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

*[[Cystic fibrosis]], the most common life-limiting [[autosomal recessive]] disease among people of Northern European heritage
*[[Sickle-cell anemia]], most prevalent in populations with sub-Saharan African ancestry but also common among Latin-American, Middle Eastern populations, as well as those people of South European regions such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/sca.shtml|title=Human Genome Project Information Site Has Been Updated|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Miriam. ''Understanding Sickle Cell Disease.'' University Press of Mississippi, 1995. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thalassemia]], most prevalent in populations having Mediterranean ancestry, to the point that the disease's name is derived from Greek ''thalasson'', "sea"
*[[Tay–Sachs disease]], an autosomal recessive disorder more frequent among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] than among other Jewish groups and non-Jewish populations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5945951 | last1 = Myrianthopoulos  |name-list-format=vanc| first1 = NC | last2 = Aronson | first2 = SM | title = Population dynamics of Tay-Sachs disease. I. Reproductive fitness and selection. | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics| volume=18 | issue=4 |date=July 1966 | pages=313–27 | pmc = 1706099}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hereditary hemochromatosis]], most common among persons having Northern European ancestry, in particular those people of Celtic descent
*[[Lactose intolerance]] affects (over their lifetime) as many as 25% of Europeans but up to 50-80% of Hispanics, along with Ashkenazi Jews, but nearly 100% of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=Shinjini | last1=Bhatnagar | first2=Rakesh | last2=Aggarwal  | journal=British Medical Journal| year=2007 | pages=1331–1332 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39252.524375.80 | volume=334 | issue=7608 | title=Lactose intolerance | pmid=17599979 | pmc=1906652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multifactorial polygenic diseases===
Many diseases differ in frequency between different populations. However, complex diseases are affected by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. There is controversy over the extent to which some of these conditions are influenced by genes, and ongoing research aims to identify which genetic loci, if any, are linked to these diseases. "Risk is the probability that an event will occur. In epidemiology, it is most often used to express the probability that a particular outcome will occur following a particular exposure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf|title=Definitions of Risk|journal=Journal of Dental Education|date=October 1, 2001|volume=65|issue=10|pages=1007–8 |author=Brian A. Burt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031003820/http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf|archivedate=October 31, 2004|pmid=11699970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index3.html|title=WHO - Genes and human disease|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different populations are considered "high-risk" or "low-risk" groups for various diseases due to the probability of that particular population being more exposed to certain risk factors. Beyond genetic factors, history and culture, as well as current environmental and social conditions, influence a certain populations' risk for specific diseases.

===Disease progression===
Groups may differ in how a disease progresses. Black men who were diagnosed with HIV generally fared worse than their white and Hispanic counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2007|title=Racial/ethnic and age disparities in HIV prevalence and disease progression among men who have sex with men in the United States|url=|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1060–6|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.087551|pmc=1874211|pmid=17463370|author1=Hall HI|author2=Byers RH|author3=Ling Q|author4=Espinoza L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of men studied with very low CD4+ T-cell count, defined as fewer than 50 cells per microliter, at AIDS diagnosis was 24.1% for white men, 27.8% for Hispanic men, and 34.4% for Black men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Black men were also significantly less likely to be alive three years after diagnosis (80.6%) than Hispanic or white men, who had 85.2% and 84.5% survival rates, respectively. However, the reasons for these differences are not clear, and should not be understood as an essential difference between races, but rather as effects of social and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Prevention===
Genetics have been proven to be a strong predictor for common diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric illnesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernandez|first=Lyla M.|last2=Blazer|first2=Dan G.|last3=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Assessing Interactions Among Social|first3=Behavioral|date=2006-01-01|title=Genetics and Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19932/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and geneticists have been able to determine that "[[human genetic variation]] is geographically structured".  The different geographic regions correlate with different races,&lt;ref name=pmid15508000&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorde|first=Lynn B.|last2=Wooding|first2=Stephen P.|date=2004-10-26|title=Genetic variation, classification and 'race' |journal=Nature Genetics|language=en|volume=36|issue=11 Suppl|pages=S28–S33|doi=10.1038/ng1435|pmid=15508000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is logical when looking at the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|"Out of Africa" theory]] and understanding how changes in genetics of a population acquire over time.

Examples of diseases which are more common in certain racial groups are [[sickle-cell disease]] in African and Mediterranean populations, and [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[HFE hereditary haemochromatosis|hemochromatosis]] in northern European populations.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt;  This information can be made available to people by their physicians, and is useful in prevention or early detection of these diseases.  For instance, a baby with sickle cell disease should be more closely monitored throughout their life than a baby without it.

While genetics certainly play a role in determining how susceptible a person is to specific diseases, environmental factors and lifestyle play a large role as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Norman B.|last2=Bulatao|first2=Rodolfo A.|last3=Cohen|first3=Barney|last4=National Research Council (US) Panel on Race|first4=Ethnicity|date=2004-01-01|title=Genetic Factors in Ethnic Disparities in Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25517/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, it is impossible to discern exactly what causes a person to acquire a disease, but it's clear that a mixture of all 3 factors are at play.  Each person's health is unique, as they have different genetic compositions and life histories.

The science of 'ethnic health', or research into ethnicity and health, and the development of services which are [[Cultural competence|culturally competent]] to meet the specific health care needs of minority ethnic groups, is still in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Mark | last=Johnson | contribution=Ethnicity | title=Public Health Evidence: Tackling health inequalities | editor1-first=Amanda | editor1-last=Killoran | editor2-first=Catherine| editor2-last=Swann|editor3-first=Michael P.|editor3-last=Kelly|year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press| url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198520832.do}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091021011210/http://www.omhrc.gov/ Office of Minority Health] provides useful links and supports research and development relating to the needs of America's ethnic minorities. In the United Kingdom, the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] established a specialist collection on Ethnicity &amp; Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Evidence - ethnicity and health|url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324235329/http://www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity/|archivedate=2007-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This resource was supported by the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) as part of the UK NHS Evidence initiative [[NHS Evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NHS Evidence]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, there are growing numbers of resource and research centers which are seeking to provide this service for other national settings, such as [http://mmha.org.au/ Multicultural Mental Health Australia].

"Race-based medicine" is the term for medicines that are targeted at specific ethnic clusters which are shown to have a propensity for a certain disorder. The first example of this in the U.S. was when [[BiDil]], a medication for congestive heart failure, was licensed specifically for use in American patients that self-identify as black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = AL | last2 = Ziesche | first2 = S | last3 = Yancy | first3 = C |name-list-format=vanc| last4 = Carson | first4 = P | last5 = D'agostino Jr | first5 = R | last6 = Ferdinand | first6 = K | last7 = Taylor | first7 = M | last8 = Adams | first8 = K | last9 = Sabolinski | first9 = M| last10 = Worcel | first10 = Manuel | last11 = Cohn | first11 = Jay N. | date = November 2004 | title=Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure | url = | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 20| pages = 2049–57 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa042934 | pmid = 15533851 | display-authors = 8 | author12 = African-American Heart Failure Trial Investigators }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies had shown that African American patients with congestive heart failure generally respond less effectively to traditional treatments than white patients with similar conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Exner | first1 = DV | last2 = Dries | first2 = DL | last3 = Domanski | first3 = MJ | last4 = Cohn | first4 = JN |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2001 | title = Lesser response to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy in blacks as compared with white patients with left ventricular dysfunction | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 344 | issue = 18| pages = 1351–7 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200105033441802 | pmid = 11333991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two trials, BiDil was licensed exclusively for use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African Americans than in other groups, but merely that it was more effective in African Americans than other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2006.00181.x |title=Medicine in black and white: BiDil®: race and the limits of evidence‐based medicine |journal=Significance |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=118–21 |year=2006 |last1=Ellison |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics are concerned that the trend of research on race-specific pharmaceutical treatments will result in inequitable access to pharmaceutical innovation and smaller minority groups may be ignored. This has led to a call for regulatory approaches to be put in place to ensure scientific validity of racial disparity in pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Winichoff, D. E.|author2=Obasagie, O. K. |year=2008|title=Race-specific drugs: Regulatory trends in public policy|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|url=http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=4110|volume=29|issue=6|pages=277–9 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2008.03.008|pmid=18453000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to "race-based medicine" is personalized medicine that involves identifying genetic, genomic (i.e., genomic sequencing), and clinical information—as opposed to using race as a proxy for these data—to better predict a patient's predisposition to certain diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-conditions/cancer/personalized-medicine#2|title=2.

==Environmental factors==

A positive correlation between minorities and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in [[health]]. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that [[Minority group|minorities]] in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets.&lt;ref name="Suarez 912–920"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Jonathan J.|last2=Isakova|first2=Tamara|last3=Anderson|first3=Cheryl A.

Furthermore, this can also occur when minorities living in rural areas undergoing urbanization, are introduced to fast food. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the students who participated in this study as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetes]], or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angkurawaranon|first=Chaisiri|last2=Wisetborisut|first2=Anawat|last3=Rerkasem|first3=Kittipan|last4=Seubsman|first4=Sam-ang|last5=Sleigh|first5=Adrian|last6=Doyle|first6=Pat|last7=Nitsch|first7=Dorothea|date=2015-09-16|title=Early life urban exposure as a risk factor for developing obesity and impaired fasting glucose in later adulthood: results from two cohorts in Thailand|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=15 |pages=902|doi=10.1186/s12889-015-2220-5|issn=1471-2458|pmc=4572635|pmid=26376960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food.  Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet;  this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from [[Cyprus]], a country east of the mediterranean sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lazarou|first=Chrystalleni|last2=Kalavana|first2=Theano|date=2009-01-01|title=Urbanization influences dietary habits of Cypriot children: the CYKIDS study|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=54|issue=2|pages=69–77|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-8054-0|issn=1661-8564|pmid=19234670}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food.

==Genetic factors==
The fact that every human has a unique genetic code is the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting. Versions of a trait, known as alleles, occur at different frequencies in different human populations; populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tend to differ more.

A phenotype is the "outward, physical manifestation" of an organism."&lt;ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/BioInfo/GP/Definition.html|title=Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, phenotypic differences are most readily seen via skin color, eye color, hair color, or height; however, any observable structure, function, or behavior can be considered part of a phenotype. A genotype is the "internally coded, inheritable information" carried by all living organisms. The human genome is encoded in DNA&lt;ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"/&gt;

For any trait of interest, observed differences among individuals "may be due to differences in the genes" coding for a trait or "the result of variation in environmental condition". This variability is due to gene-environment interactions that influence genetic expression patterns and trait heritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/heritability/heritability.htm|title=Estimating additive genetic variation and heritability of phenotypic traits|website=userwww.sfsu.edu|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For humans, there is "more genetic variation among individual people than between larger racial groups".&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt; In general, an average of 80% of genetic variation exists within local populations, around 10% is between local populations within the same continent, and approximately 8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-9063-3_14 |chapter=The Apportionment of Human Diversity |title=Evolutionary Biology |pages=381–98 |year=1972 |last1=Lewontin |first1=R.

R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found evidence of genetic differences between populations, but the distribution of genetic variants within and among human populations is impossible to describe succinctly because of the difficulty of defining a "population", the clinal nature of variation, and heterogeneity across the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00439-003-0971-z |pmid=12884000 |title=Allelic variation at alcohol metabolism genes ( ADH1B , ADH1C , ALDH2 ) and alcohol dependence in an American Indian population |journal=Human Genetics |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=325–36 |year=2003 |last1=Mulligan |first1=Connie J |last2=Robin |first2=Robert W |last3=Osier |first3=Michael V |last4=Sambuughin |first4=Nyamkhishig |last5=Goldfarb |first5=Lev G |last6=Kittles |first6=Rick A |last7=Hesselbrock |first7=Diane |last8=Goldman |first8=David |last9=Long |first9=Jeffrey C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the racialization of science and medicine can lead to controversy when the term population and race are used interchangeably.

Genes may be under strong selection in response to local diseases. For example, people who are [[duffy antigen|duffy negative]] tend to have higher resistance to malaria. Most Africans are duffy negative and most non-Africans are duffy positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria and the Red Cell|publisher=Harvard University|year=2002|url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127201806/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|archivedate=2011-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of genetic diseases more prevalent in malaria-afflicted areas may provide some [[genetic resistance to malaria]] including [[sickle cell disease]], [[thalassaemias]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and possibly others.

[[Cystic fibrosis#Theories about prevalence|Many theories about the origin of the cystic fibrosis]] have suggested that it provides a [[heterozygote advantage]] by giving resistance to diseases earlier common in Europe.

In earlier research, a common theory was the "[[common disease-common variant]]" model. It argues that for common illnesses, the genetic contribution comes from the additive or multiplicative effects of gene variants that each one is common in the population. Each such gene variant is argued to cause only a small risk of disease and no single variant is enough to cause the disease. An individual must have many of these common gene variants in order for the risk of disease to be substantial.&lt;ref name=pmid20403315&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = King | first2 = M.

More recent research indicates that the "common disease-rare variant" may be a better explanation for many common diseases. In this model, rare but higher-risk gene variants cause common diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schork|first=N.J|year=2009|title=Common vs. rare allele hypotheses for complex diseases|url=|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume=19|issue=3|pages=212–219|via=|pmid=19481926|pmc=2914559|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2009.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model may be relevant for diseases that reduces fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krausz|first=C|year=2015|title=Genetics of male infertility: From research to clinic|journal=Reproduction|volume=150|issue=5|pages=R159–R174|via=|pmid=26447148|doi= 10.1530/REP-15-0261|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/150/5/R159.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, for common genes associated with common disease to persist they must either have little effect during the reproductive period of life (like [[Alzheimer's disease]]) or provide some advantage in the original environment (like genes causing autoimmune diseases also providing resistance against infections). In either case varying frequencies of genes variants in different populations may be an explanation for health disparities.&lt;ref name=pmid20403315/&gt; Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, [[deep venous thrombosis]], [[Crohn disease]], and [[type 2 diabetes]] appear to adhere to "common disease-common variant" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lohmueller KE, Pearce CL, Pike M, Lander ES, Hirschhorn JN | year = 2003 | title = Meta-analysis of genetic association studies supports a contribution of common variants to susceptibility to common disease | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 177–182 | doi = 10.1038/ng1071 | pmid = 12524541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene flow===
[[Gene flow]] and [[Genetic admixture|admixture]] can also have an effect on relationships between race and race-linked disorders. Multiple sclerosis, for example, is typically associated with people of European descent, but due to admixture African Americans have elevated levels of the disorder relative to Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15596747  |name-list-format=vanc| last1 = Cree | first1 = BA | last2 = Khan | first2 = O | last3 = Bourdette | first3 = D | last4 = Goodin | first4 = DS | last5 = Cohen | first5 = JA | last6 = Marrie | first6 = RA | last7 = Glidden | first7 = D | last8 = Weinstock-Guttman | first8 = B | last9 = Reich | first9 = D | last10 =Patterson | first10 =N. | last11 =Haines | first11 =J.

Some diseases and physiological variables vary depending upon their admixture ratios. Examples include measures of [[insulin]] functioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gower B. A.| year = 2003 | title = Using genetic admixture to explain racial differences in insulin-related phenotypes | url = | journal = Diabetes | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 1047–1051 | doi=10.2337/diabetes.52.4.1047|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernandez J.

=== Gene interactions ===
The same gene variant, or group of gene variants, may produce different effects in different populations depending on differences in the gene variants, or groups of gene variants, they interact with. One example is the rate of progression to [[AIDS]] and death in [[HIV]]&amp;ndash;infected patients. In Caucasians and Hispanics, HHC [[haplotype]]s were associated with disease retardation, particularly a delayed progression to death, while for African Americans, possession of HHC haplotypes was associated with disease acceleration. In contrast, while the disease-retarding effects of the CCR2-641 allele were found in African Americans, they were not found in Caucasians.&lt;ref name=gonz1996&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gonzalez E, etal | year = 1999 | title = Race-specific HIV-1 disease-modifying effects associated with CCR5 haplotypes | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.21.12004 | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 96 | issue = 21 | pages = 12004–12009 | pmid = 10518566 | pmc = 18402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{See also|Race (classification of humans)|Race and genetics}}

There is a controversy regarding race as a method for classifying humans. Different sources argue it is purely social construct&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witzig|first=Ritchie|date=1996-10-15|title=The Medicalization of Race: Scientific Legitimization of a Flawed Social Construct|url=http://annals.org/aim/article/710064/medicalization-race-scientific-legitimization-flawed-social-construct|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=125|issue=8|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-125-8-199610150-00008|issn=0003-4819|pmid=8849153|pages=675–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a biological reality reflecting average genetic group differences.  New interest in human biological variation has resulted in a resurgence of the use of race in biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Page 188. "Far from waning in the age of molecular genetics, race has been resurgent in biomedical discourse, especially in relation to a torrent of new interest in human biological variation and its quantification."&lt;/ref&gt;

The main impetus for this development is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of certain [[disease]]s by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors, such as genetically conditioned health factors, based on more easily ascertained characteristics such as phenotype and racial self-identification. Since medical judgment often involves decision making under uncertain conditions,&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 9"&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; many doctors consider it useful to take race into account when treating disease because diseases and treatment responses tend to cluster by geographic ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Satel, Sally. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/magazine/i-am-a-racially-profiling-doctor.html "I Am a Racially Profiling Doctor"]. The New York Times, published May 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery that more diseases than previously thought correlate with racial identification have further sparked the interest in using race as a proxy for bio-geographical ancestry and genetic buildup.

Race in medicine is used as an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;

Taking the example of [[sickle-cell disease]], in an [[Emergency department|emergency room]], knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race.&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 9" /&gt;

The continued use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the continued use of racial categories in health care and as risk factors could result in increased [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and discrimination in society and health services.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 5"&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S.

Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.

David Williams (1994) argued, after an examination of articles in the journal ''Health Services Research'' during the 1966–90 period, that how race was determined and defined was seldom described. At a minimum, researchers should describe if race was assessed by self-report, proxy report, extraction from records, or direct observation. Race was also often used questionable, such as an indicator of socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Williams DR |title=The concept of race in Health Services Research: 1966 to 1990 |journal=Health Services Research |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=261–74 |date=August 1994 |pmid=8063565 |pmc=1070005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial genetic explanations may be overemphasized, ignoring the interaction with and the role of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Goodman AH |title=Why genes don't count (for racial differences in health) |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1699–702 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11076233 |pmc=1446406 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.11.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From concepts of race to ethnogenetic layering ===

There is general agreement that a goal of health-related genetics should be to move past the weak surrogate relationships of racial health disparity and get to the root causes of health and disease. This includes research which strives to analyze human genetic variation in smaller groups than races across the world.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;

One such method is called ethnogenetic layering. It works by focusing on geographically identified microethnic groups. For example, in the Mississippi Delta region ethnogenetic layering might include such microethnic groups as the Cajun (as a subset of European Americans), the Creole and Black groups [with African origins in Senegambia, Central Africa and Bight of Benin] (as a subset of African Americans), and Choctaw, Houmas, Chickasaw, Coushatta, Caddo, Atakapa, Karankawa and Chitimacha peoples (as subsets of Native Americans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson F.L.C. | year = 2008 | title = Ethnogenetic layering (EL): an alternative to the traditional race model in human variation and health disparity studies | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 121–144 | doi = 10.1080/03014460801941752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = F.

Better still may be individual genetic assessment of relevant genes.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt; As genotyping and sequencing have become more accessible and affordable, avenues for determining individual genetic makeup have opened dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/internet/site/data/sup_data/2253/individual_genomes_instead_of_race_for_personalized_medicine.pdf |title=Individual Genomes Instead of Race for Personalized Medicine|vauthors=Ng PC, Zhao Q, Levy S, Strausberg RL, Venter JC|journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther|year=2008|volume=84|issue=3|pages=306–309|doi=10.1038/clpt.2008.114|pmid=18714319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when such methods become commonly available, race will continue to be important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in epidemiologic research.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt;

Some doctors and scientists such as geneticist [[Neil Risch]] argue that using self-identified race as a proxy for ancestry is necessary to be able to get a sufficiently broad sample of different ancestral populations, and in turn to be able to provide health care that is tailored to the needs of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Risch N. |author2=Burchard E. |author3=Ziv E. |author4=Tang H. | year = 2002 | title = Categorization of humans in biomedical research: genes, race and disease | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007| journal = Genome Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 7| pages = 1–12 | pmc=139378 | pmid=12184798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association studies==
{{See also|Genetic association}}
One area in which population categories can be important considerations in genetics research is in controlling for confounding between population genetic substructure, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. [[Association studies]] can produce spurious results if cases and controls have differing allele frequencies for genes that are not related to the disease being studied,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cardon LR, Palmer LJ | year = 2003 | title = Population stratification and spurious allelic association | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9357| pages = 598–604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12520-2 | pmid = 12598158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchini J, Cardon LR, Phillips MS, Donnelly P | year = 2004 | title = The effects of human population structure on large genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 512–517 | doi = 10.1038/ng1337 | pmid = 15052271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the magnitude of its problem in genetic association studies is subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas DC, Witte JS | year = 2002 | title = Point: population stratification: a problem for case-control studies of candidate-gene associations? | url = | journal = Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 505–512 | pmid = 12050090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wacholder S, Rothman N, Caporaso N|title=Counterpoint: bias from population stratification is not a major threat to the validity of conclusions from epidemiological studies of common polymorphisms and cancer|journal=Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev|year=2002|volume=11|issue=6|pages=513–20 |pmid=12050091|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/11/6/513.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various techniques detect and account for population substructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton NE, Collins A | year = 1998 | title = Tests and estimates of allelic association in complex inheritance | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 95 | issue = 19| pages = 11389–11393 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.19.11389 | pmid = 9736746 | pmc = 21652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoggart CJ, Parra EJ, Shriver MD, Bonilla C, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | year = 2003 | title = Control of confounding of genetic associations in stratified populations | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 72 | issue = 6| pages = 1492–1504 | doi = 10.1086/375613 | pmid = 12817591 | pmc = 1180309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but these methods can be difficult to apply in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Freedman ML|author2=Reich D|author3=Penney KL|author4=McDonald GJ|author5=Mignault AA|author6=Patterson N|author7=Gabriel SB|author8=Topol EJ|author9=Smoller JW | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the impact of population stratification on genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 388–393 | pmid = 15052270 | doi = 10.1038/ng1333 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population genetic substructure also can aid genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer-range [[linkage disequilibrium]] between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers than is the case for other populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoggart CJ, Shriver MD, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | year = 2004 | title = Design and analysis of admixture mapping studies | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5| pages = 965–978 | pmid = 15088268 | doi = 10.1086/420855 | pmc = 1181989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors  = Patterson N, Hattangadi N, Lane B, Lohmueller KE, Hafler DA, Oksenberg JR, Hauser SL, Smith MW, O'Brien SJ | year = 2004 | title = Methods for high-density admixture mapping of disease genes | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5| pages = 979–1000 | pmid = 15088269 | doi = 10.1086/420871 | pmc = 1181990 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith| first1 = Michael W.| last2 = Patterson| first2 = Nick| last3 = Lautenberger| first3 = James A.| last4 = Truelove| first4 = Ann L.| last5 = McDonald| first5 = Gavin J.| last6 = Waliszewska| first6 = Alicja| last7 = Kessing| first7 = Bailey D.| last8 = Malasky| first8 = Michael J.| last9 = Scafe| first9 = Charles| last10 = Le| first10 = Ernest| last11 = Jager| first11 = Philip L.

==Human genome projects==
The [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] has collected genetic samples from 52 indigenous populations.

==Sources of racial disparities in care==
In a report by the [[Institute of Medicine]] called Unequal Treatment, three major source categories are put forth as potential explanations for disparities in health care: patient-level variables, healthcare system-level factors, and care process-level variables.&lt;ref name=Smed2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Smedley|first=Brian D.|title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=0-309-50911-4|pages=7–12|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient-level variables===
There are many individual factors that could explain the established differences in health care between different racial and ethnic groups.  First, attitudes and behaviors of minority patients are different.  They are more likely to refuse recommended services, adhere poorly to treatment regimens, and delay seeking care, yet despite this, these behaviors and attitudes are unlikely to explain the differences in health care.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; In addition to behaviors and attitudes, biological based racial differences have been documented, but these also seem unlikely to explain the majority of observed disparities in care.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt;

===Health system-level factors===
Health system-level factors include any aspects of health systems that can have different effects on patient outcomes.  Some of these factors include different access to services, access to insurance or other means to pay for services, access to adequate language and interpretation services, and geographic availability of different services.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; Many studies assert that these factors explain portions of the existing disparities in health of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States when compared to their white counterparts.

===Care process-level variables===
Three major mechanisms are suggested by the Institute of Medicine that may contribute to healthcare disparities from the provider's side: bias (or prejudice) against racial and ethnic minorities; greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority patients; and beliefs held by the provider about the behavior or health of minorities.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; Research in this area is new and ongoing.

The '''Reference Daily Intake''' ('''RDI''') is the daily intake level of a [[nutrient]] that is considered to be sufficient to meet the [[Dietary requirements|requirements]] of 97–98% of healthy individuals in every [[demographic]] in the [[United States]]. While developed for the [[US population]], it has been adopted by other countries, though not universally.

The RDI is used to determine the '''Daily Value''' ('''DV''') of foods, which is printed on [[nutrition facts label]]s (as '''% DV''') in the United States and [[Canada]], and is regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Health Canada]]. The labels "high", "rich in", or "excellent source of" may be used for a food if it contains 20% or more of the RDI. The labels "good source", "contains", or "provides" may be used on a food if it contains between 10% and 20% of the RDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient content claims for 'good source', 'high', 'more', and 'high potency', Specific Requirements for Nutrient Content Claims. Food Labeling, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter I, Subchapter B, Part 101, Subpart D, Section 101.54|url= https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=101&amp;showFR=1&amp;subpartNode=21:2.0.1.1.2.4|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=April 1, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Recommended Dietary Allowances''' ('''RDAs''') were a set of nutrition recommendations that evolved into both the [[Dietary Reference Intake]] (DRI) system of nutrition recommendations (which still defines RDA values) and the RDIs used for food labelling.  The first regulations governing U.S. nutrition labels specified a ''% U.S. RDA'' declaration based on the current RDA values, which had been published in 1968. Later, the % U.S. RDA was renamed the %DV and the RDA values that the %DVs were based on became the RDIs.

The RDAs (and later the RDA values within the DRI) were regularly revised to reflect the latest scientific information, but although the [[nutrition labeling]] regulations were occasionally updated, the existing RDI values were not changed, so that until 2016 many of the DVs used on nutrition facts labels were still based on the outdated RDAs from 1968. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration published changes to the regulations including updated RDIs and DVs based primarily on the RDAs in the current DRI.

The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates "Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel – Compliance Date"]&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, products with old or new facts panel content will be on market shelves at same time.

== History ==
The RDI is derived from the RDAs, which were first developed during [[World War II]] by [[Lydia J. Roberts]], [[Hazel Stiebeling]] and [[Helen S. Mitchell]], all part of a committee established by the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] to investigate issues of nutrition that might "affect national defense" (Nestle, 35).{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941, after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient. The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces, for civilians, and for overseas population who might need food relief. Roberts, Stiebeling, and Mitchell surveyed all available data, created a tentative set of allowances for "energy and eight nutrients", and submitted them to experts for review (Nestle, 35).{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} The final set of guidelines, called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances, were accepted in 1941. The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel, so they included a "margin of safety". Because of food rationing during the war, the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens' nutritional intake also took food availability into account.

The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years. In 1973, the FDA introduced regulations to specify the format of nutrition labels when present, although the inclusion of such labels was largely voluntary, only being required if nutrition claims were made or if nutritional supplements were added to the food. The nutrition labels were to include percent U.S. RDA based on the 1968 RDAs in effect at the time. The RDAs continued to be updated (in 1974, 1980 and 1989) but the values specified for nutrition labelling remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="iom-2010-history"&gt;{{cite book | title=Front-of-Package Nutrition Rating Systems and Symbols: Phase I Report | chapter=2 History of Nutrition Labeling | author=Institute of Medicine | date=2010 | doi=10.17226/12957 | chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12957/chapter/4 | publisher=The National Academies Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the FDA published new regulations mandating the inclusion of a [[nutrition facts label]] on most packaged foods. Originally the FDA had proposed replacing the percent U.S. RDAs with percent daily values based on the 1989 RDAs but the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 prevented it from doing so. Instead it introduced the RDI to be the basis of the new daily values. The RDI consisted of the existing U.S. RDA values (still based on the 1968 RDAs as the FDA was not allowed to change them at the time) and new values for additional nutrients not included in the 1968 RDAs.&lt;ref name="iom-2010-history"/&gt;

In 1997, at the suggestion of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the National Academy, the RDAs became one part of a broader set of dietary guidelines called the [[Dietary Reference Intake]] used by both the United States and Canada. As part of the DRI, the RDAs continued to be updated.

On May 27, 2016, the FDA updated the regulations to change the RDI and Daily Values to reflect current scientific information.&lt;ref name=fda16/&gt;&lt;ref name=FedReg/&gt; Until this time, the Daily Values were still largely based on the 1968 RDAs. The new regulations make several other changes to the nutrition facts label to facilitate consumer understanding of the calorie and nutrient contents of their foods, emphasizing nutrients of current concern, such as [[vitamin D]] and [[potassium]].&lt;ref name=fda16/&gt; The revision to the regulations came into effect on 26 July 2016 and initially stipulated that larger manufacturers must comply within two years while smaller manufacturers had an additional year.&lt;ref name="fda16"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm | title=Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label | publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | work=FDA Labeling and Nutrition | date=May 20, 2016 | accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iom-2010-history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels | journal=Federal Register | date=May 27, 2016 | id={{Federal Register|81|33741}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"/&gt;

==Sodium==

In 2010, the U.S. [[Institute of Medicine]] determined that the government should establish new consumption standards for salt to reduce the amount of [[sodium]] in the typical American diet below levels associated with higher risk of several [[cardiovascular diseases]], yet maintain consumer preferences for salt-flavored food.&lt;ref name="iom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12818 |title=FDA should set standards for salt added to processed foods, prepared meals|publisher=U.S. National Academies of Science |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily maximum for sodium in the United States had been above estimated minimums for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/salt_up2.htm |title=Statement from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program |publisher=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD |date=1999-10-14 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320182203/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/salt_up2.htm |archivedate=2011-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] found that 500 milligrams of sodium per day (approximately 1,250 milligrams of table salt) is a safe minimum level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1349&amp;page=253 |title=Recommended Dietary Allowances: 10th Edition |publisher=The National Academies Press, Washington, DC |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the daily allowance for salt is 6&amp;nbsp;g (approximately 2.5 teaspoons, about the upper limit in the U.S.), an amount considered "too high".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8376701.stm |title=Daily salt intake allowances 'were set too high' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3650578.stm |title=Britons told to cut salt intake |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Medicine advisory stated (daily intake basis): "Americans consume more than 3,400 milligrams of sodium &amp;ndash; the amount in about 1.5 teaspoons of salt (8.7&amp;nbsp;g) – each day. The recommended maximum daily intake of sodium – the amount above which health problems appear – is 2,300 milligrams per day for adults, about 1 teaspoon of salt (5.9&amp;nbsp;g). The recommended adequate intake of sodium is 1,500 milligrams (3.9&amp;nbsp;g salt) per day, and people over 50 need even less."&lt;ref name=iom/&gt;

==Neolithic==

In the book ''[[Inside the Neolithic Mind]]'', the authors, archaeologists [[David Lewis-Williams]] and David Pearce argue that hallucinogenic drugs formed the basis of neolithic religion and rock art. Similar practices and images are found in some contemporary "stone-age" [[Indigenous peoples in South America]] using [[yaje]].

==Ancient Greece==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some scholars have suggested that Ancient Greek [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s employed [[entheogens|entheogen]], such as the [[Kykeon]] central to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], to induce a trance or dream state. Research conducted by John R. Hale, Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, Jeffrey P. Chanton and Henry A. Spiller suggests that the prophecies of the [[Delphic Oracle]] were uttered by Priestesses under the influence of gaseous vapors exuded from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/19/science/for-delphic-oracle-fumes-and-visions.html|title=For Delphic Oracle, Fumes and Visions|last=Broad|first=William J.|date=2002-03-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings are published in ''Questioning the Delphic Oracle: Overview / An Intoxicating Tale''.

== Buddhism ==
{{see also|Five Precepts|Buddhist ethics|ethic of reciprocity|karma|two truths doctrine}}
In Buddhism the Right [[view (Buddhism)|View]] (''{{IAST|samyag-dṛṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') can also be translated as "right perspective", "right outlook" or "right understanding", is the right way of looking at life, nature, and the world as they really are for us. It is to understand how our reality works. It acts as the reasoning with which someone starts practicing the path. It explains [[five aggregates|the reasons]] for our human existence, suffering, sickness, aging, death, the existence of greed, hatred, and delusion. Right view gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors. It begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom, which can eradicate the [[fetter (Buddhism)|fetters of the mind]]. An understanding of right view will inspire the person to lead a virtuous life in line with right view. In the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli]] and [[Chinese Buddhist Canon|Chinese canons]], it is explained thus:&lt;ref name="BSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.piya.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Piyadassi Thera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html |title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=27 October 2008 |publisher=Cbeta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122103247/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=27 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122092756/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|archivedate=22 November 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right livelihood===
Right livelihood (''samyag-ājīva'' / ''sammā-ājīva''). This means that practitioners ought not to engage in trades or occupations which, either directly or indirectly, result in harm for other living beings. In the Chinese and Pali Canon, it is explained thus:&lt;ref name=BSac/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu"/&gt;

{{quote|And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood.}}

More concretely today interpretations include "work and career need to be integrated into life as a Buddhist,"&lt;ref name="triratna"&gt;[http://thebuddhistcentre.com/text/right-livelihood Right Livelihood], The Buddhist Centre: a triratna buddhist community space&lt;/ref&gt; it is also an ethical livelihood, "wealth obtained through rightful means" (Bhikku Basnagoda Rahula) – that means being honest and ethical in business dealings, not to cheat, lie or steal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lewis-richmond/right-livelihood-is-consc_b_832298.html Buddhism and Wealth: Defining 'Right Livelihood'], Huff Post, 16 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As people are spending most of their time at work, it’s important to assess how our work affects our mind and heart. So important questions include "How can work become meaningful? How can it be a support, not a hindrance, to spiritual practice — a place to deepen our awareness and kindness?"&lt;ref name="triratna"/&gt;

The five types of businesses that should not be undertaken:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.177.than.html |title=Vanijja Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bogoda/wheel397.html |title=A Simple Guide to Life |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Robert Bogoda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/price/wheel363.html |title=Two Dialogues on Dhamma |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Robert Bogoda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Business in weapons: [[Arms industry|trading in all kinds of weapons]] and instruments for killing.
# Business in human beings: [[slave trading]], [[prostitution]], or the buying and selling of children or adults.
# Business in meat: "meat" refers to the bodies of beings after they are killed. This includes breeding animals for slaughter.
# Business in intoxicants: manufacturing or selling [[intoxicating drink]]s or [[addictive drug]]s.
# Business in poison: producing or trading in any kind of [[poison]] or a toxic product designed to kill.

=== The fifth precept ===
According to the fifth precept of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] are meant to refrain from any quantity of "fermented or distilled beverages" which would prevent mindfulness or cause heedlessness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Dahlke |first1=Paul |last2=Sīlācāra |first2=Bhikkhu |last3=Oates |first3=L.R. |last4=Lounsbery |first4=G. Constant |title=The Five Precepts |journal=The Wheel Publication |year=1963 |publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |location=Sri Lanka |volume= |issue=55 |pages= |url=http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh055.pdf |issn=0068-3345 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pali]] [[Tipitaka]] the precept is explicitly concerned with [[alcoholic beverage]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I undertake the training rule to abstain from fermented drink that causes heedlessness."
&lt;br /&gt;
''Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, [[caffeine]] and [[tea]] are permitted, even encouraged for monks of most traditions, as it is believed to promote wakefulness.

Generally speaking, the vast majority of Buddhists and Buddhist sects denounce and have historically frowned upon the use of any intoxicants by an individual who has taken the five precepts. Most Buddhists view the use and abuse of intoxicants to be a hindrance in the development of an [[Bodhicitta|enlightened mind]]. However, there are a few historical and doctrinal exceptions.

=== Vajrayana ===

{{see also|Skillful means|ganachakra|amrita}}

Many modern Buddhist schools have strongly discouraged the use of psychoactive drugs of any kind; however, they may not be prohibited in all circumstances in all traditions. Some denominations of [[Tantric Buddhism|tantric]] or esoteric Buddhism especially exemplify the latter, often with the principle [[skillful means]]:

==== Alcohol ====

For example, as part of the  [[ganachakra]] ''tsok'' ritual (as well as [[Homa (ritual)|Homa]], [[abhisheka]] and sometimes [[drubchen]]) some [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] and [[Bön]]pos have been known to ingest small amounts of [[grain alcohol|grain]] [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] (called ''amrit'' or ''[[amrita#Buddhism|amrita]]'') as an offering. If a member is an alcoholic, or for some other reason does not wish to partake in the drinking of the alcoholic offering, then he or she may dip a finger in the alcohol and then flick it three times as [[Tsok#Alcohol in Vajrayana|part of the ceremony]].

Amrita is also possibly the same as, or at least in some sense a conceptual derivative of the ancient Hindu ''[[soma (drink)|soma]]''. (The latter which historians often equate with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' or other ''[[Amanita]]'' [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[fungi]].) Crowley (1996) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Undoubtedly, the striking parallels between "The legend about Chakdor" and the Hindu legend of the origin of soma show that the Buddhist amrita and the Hindu soma were at one time understood to be identical. Moreover, the principal property of amrita is, to this day, perceived by Buddhists as being a species of inebriation, however symbolically this inebriation may be interpreted. Why else would beer (Tibetan ''chhang'', "barley beer") be used by yogins as a symbolic substitute for amrita [Ardussi]? Conversely, why else would the term bDud.rTsi be used as a poetic synonym for [[beer]]?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conversely, in [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] lore there is a story about a monk who came across a woman who told him that he must either:
* '''a.''' kill her goat,
* '''b.''' sleep with her, or
* '''c.''' drink a mug of [[beer]].
* '''d.''' All of the above.

The monk thought to himself, "''well, surely if I kill the goat then I will be causing great suffering since a living being will die. If I sleep with the woman then I will have broken another great vow of a monk and will surely be lost to the ways of the world. Lastly, if I drink the beer then perhaps no great harm will come and I will only be intoxicated for a while, and most importantly I will only be hurting myself.''" (In the context of the story this instance is of particular importance to him because monks in the Mahayana and Vajrayana [[bodhicitta|try to bring all sentient beings to enlightenment]] as part of their goal.)

So the monk drank the mug of beer and then he became very drunk. In his drunkenness he proceeded to kill the woman and sleep with the goat, breaking all three vows and, at least in his eyes, doing much harm in the world. The lesson of this story is meant to be that, at least according to the cultures from which it delineates, alcohol causes one to break all of one's vows, in a sense that one could say it is the cause of all other harmful deeds.&lt;ref&gt;one place this story is referenced is in the more Western article 'Sherpa Purity' by Sherry B. Ortner, published in the magazine American Anthropologist. The beginning of that article is available online, here: https://www.jstor.org/pss/672339 but the story is not available unless you login etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vajrayana]] teacher Drupon Thinley Ningpo [[Rinpoche]] has said that as part of the five precepts which a layperson takes upon [[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]], that although they must refrain from taking intoxicants, they may drink enough so as they do not become drunk. [[Bhikku]]s and [[Bhikkuni]]s (monks and nuns, respectively), on the other hand, who have taken the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|ten vows]] as part of taking refuge and becoming ordained, cannot imbibe any amount of alcohol or other drugs, other than [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]]s taken as medicine.

[[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, is known as teetotaler and non-smoker.

==== Hallucinogens ====
{{see also|Dzogchen|Rahu|tantrism}}

There is some evidence regarding the use of [[deliriant]] ''[[Datura]]'' seeds (known as ''candabija'') in Dharmic rituals associated with many [[tantras]] – namely the  ''Vajramahabhairava'', ''Samputa'', ''Mahakala'', ''Guhyasamaja'', ''Tara'' and ''Krsnayamari'' tantras – as well as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and other [[entheogens]] in minority Vajrayana [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/rich_text_5.html|title=Entheogens in the Vajrayana Tradition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald M Davidson says that in Indian Vajrayana, [[Datura]] was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“employed as a narcotic paste or as wood in a fire ceremony and could be easily absorbed through the skin or the lungs. The seeds of this powerful narcotic, termed "passion seeds"  (candabija), are the strongest elements and contain the alkaloids hyoscine, hyoscyamine, and atropine in forms that survive burning or boiling. In even moderate doses, datura can render a person virtually immobile with severe belladonna-like [[hallucinations]].”&lt;ref&gt;Ronald M Davidson 2002, Indian Esoteric Buddhism: a social history of the Tantric movement (datura and betel)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Profound Summarizing Notes on the Path Presented as the Three Continua'' a [[Sakya]] [[Lamdre]] text, by [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk]] (1524-1568), the use of [[Datura]] in combination with other substances, is prescribed as part of a meditation practice meant to establish that "All the phenomena included in apparent existence, samsara and nirvana, are not established outside of one's mind."&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus; Taking the Result as the Path: Core Teachings of the Sakya Lamdre Tradition (Library of Tibetan Classics), 2006, page 421, 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Baker writes that Tibetan terma literature such as the [[Vima Nyingtik]] describes "various concoctions of mind altering substances, including datura and oleander, which can be formed into pills or placed directly in the eyes to induce visions and illuminate hidden contents of the psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Ian; The Heart of the World: A Journey to Tibet's Lost Paradise, Part Three, Hell night&lt;/ref&gt;

A book titled ''Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics'' (2002), details the history of Buddhism and the use of psychedelic drugs, and includes essays by modern Buddhist teachers on the topic.

=== Zen ===

[[Zen Buddhism]] is known for stressing the precepts. [[Buddhism in Japan|In Japan]], however, where Zen flourished historically, there are a number of examples of misconduct on the part of monks and [[Laity|laypeople]] alike. This often involved the use of alcohol, as [[sake]] drinking has and continues to be a well known aspect of [[Japanese culture]].

The Japanese Zen monk and abbot, [[shakuhachi]] player and poet [[Ikkyu]] was known for his unconventional take on [[Zen Buddhism]]: His style of expressing [[dharma]] is sometimes deemed "Red Thread Zen" or "Crazy Cloud Zen" for its unorthodox characteristics. Ikkyu is considered both a heretic and saint in the [[Rinzai]] Zen tradition, and was known for his derogatory poetry, open [[alcoholism]] and for frequenting the services of [[prostitutes]] in [[brothels]]. He personally found no conflict between his lifestyle and Buddhism.

There are several [[koans]] (Zen riddles) referencing the drinking of sake ([[rice wine]]); for instance [[Mumonkan]]'s tenth koan titled ''Seizei Is Utterly Destitute'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Seizei said to Sozan, "Seizei is utterly destitute. Will you give him support?" Sozan called out: "Seizei!" Seizei responded, "Yes sir?!" Sozan said, "You have finished three cups of the finest wine in China, and still you say you have not yet moistened your lips!"'
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another monk, Gudo, is mentioned in a koan called ''Finding a Diamond on a Muddy Road'' buying a gallon of sake.

==Judaism==
Judaism maintains that people do not own their bodies – they belong to God. As a result, Jews are not permitted to harm, mutilate, destroy or take risks with their bodies, life or health with activities such as taking life-threatening drugs. However, there is no general prohibition against drugs in Judaism, as long as they don't interfere with one's ritual duties and don't cause definite harm, though most Rabbis generally prohibit drugs, in order to avoid social, legal and medical problems in their community.

Spiritual use of various alcoholic beverages, sometimes in very large quantities, is common and well known. In some Jewish communities there is a tradition to get drunk on [[Purim]] until they forget the difference between the Hebrew phrases "Cursed is Haman" and "Blessed is Mordechai", which signified reaching the spiritual world [[Atzilut]] where all opposites unite. In many Jewish communities it is customary to drink on [[Simchat Torah]] as well. Drinking in small quantities as a mind-altering practice is commonly used during the [[Chabad|Farbrengens]] of the [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]]. A large body of Chabad literature refers to the spiritual dangers of drinking, but a few anecdotal references refer to the spirutal power of alcohol, when used for the sake of connecting to God and achieving brotherly love among fellows Jews.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Lubavitcher Rebbe forbade his Chassidim under the age of 40 to consume more than 4 small shots of hard liqueurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/08/drugs-judaism/|title=Drugs &amp; Judaism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wine]] plays a prominent role in many Jewish rituals, most notably the [[kiddush]].
Hasidic Jews often engage in a free ceremony called "Tisch" in which drinks such as Vodka are drunk in a group. Drinking is accompanied by singing and the study of the Torah.

Some Hasidic Rabbis, e.g. the [[Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz|Ribnitzer Rebbe]] used to drink large amounts of [[Vodka]] on some special occasions, apparently as a powerful mind-altering method. The [[Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz|Ribnitzer Rebbe]] also practiced severe [[sleep deprivation]], extremely long meditative prayers and a number of ascetic purification rituals. During his life in the [[USSR]] he used to immerse himself every day in ice water.

The spiritual use of [[caffeine]] and [[nicotine]] as stimulants is well known in the Hasidic communities. Many stories are told about miracles and spiritual journeys performed by the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and other famous [[Tzaddik]]im with the help of their smoking pipe. Some people suggest that, judging by the nature of these stories, the tobacco was sometimes mixed with strong mind-altering drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ethics/Our_Bodies/Health_and_Healing/Smoking_Alcohol_and_Drugs/Tobacco.shtml|title=Tobacco|work=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cannabischassidis.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_archive.html|title=Cannabis Chassidis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular Hasidic saying relates coffee to the Psalmic verse "Hope in God". The Hebrew word for "hope" ("Kave") sounds identical to the Yiddish word for coffee. Coffee is believed to have power to awaken the soul to the worship of God.

Some [[Kabbalists]], including [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Isaac of Acco]] and [[Abraham Abulafia]], mention a method of "philosophical meditation", which involves drinking a cup of "strong wine of [[Avicenna]]", which would induce a [[trance]] and would help the adept to ponder over difficult philosophical questions.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan, Meditation and Kabbalah, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The exact recipe of this wine remains unknown; Avicenna refers in his works to the effects of [[opium]] and [[datura]] extracts.

Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], a prominent researcher of Jewish meditations, suggested that some medieval Kabbalists may have used some psychedelic drugs&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan, Meditation and Kabbalah, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one can find in Kabbalistic medical manuals cryptic references to the hidden powers of [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]], [[harmal]] and other psychoactive plants, though the exact usage of these powers is hard to decipher.

According to [[Aryeh Kaplan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Aryeh|title=[[The Living Torah]]|location=New York|year=1981|page=442|isbn=0-940118-35-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannabis was an ingredient in the [[Holy anointing oil]] mentioned in various sacred [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] texts.  The herb of interest is most commonly known as ''kaneh-bosem'' (קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc11/christ.html |title=Cannabis and the Christ: Jesus used Marijuana |work=[[Cannabis Culture (magazine)|Cannabis Culture]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822175502/http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc11/christ.html |archivedate=2009-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) which is mentioned several times in the [[Old Testament]] as a bartering material, incense, and an ingredient in Holy anointing oil used by the high priest of the temple. Many [[Rastafarians]], who use cannabis as a sacrament, identify as Jewish.

According to [[Josephus]], the head-dress of the Jewish High Priests' was modeled upon the capsule of the [[Hyoscyamus niger|Hyoscyamus]] flower, which he calls "Saccharus". This Greek word for sugar stems from the Hebrew root that means "intoxicating".&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Antiquities, Book III, 7:6&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny Shanon, a psychology professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, proposed that Moses may have been high on hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time he received the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-525993/Moses-high-hallucinogenic-drug-received-Ten-Commandments-claims-academic.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title='Moses was high on hallucinogenic drug when he received Ten Commandments,' claims top academic | date=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{see also|Christian views on alcohol|}}

Many [[Christian]] denominations disapprove of the use of most illicit drugs. Many denominations permit the moderate use of socially and legally acceptable drugs like [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[caffeine]] and [[tobacco]]. Some [[Christian]] denominations permit smoking [[tobacco]], while others disapprove of it. Many denominations do not have any official stance on drug use, some more-recent Christian denominations (e.g. [[Mormons]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]]) discourage or prohibit the use of any of these substances.

Because [[Jesus]] and many Biblical figures drank [[wine]], most [[Christian]] denominations do not require [[teetotalism]]. In the Eucharist, wine represents (or among [[Christian]]s who believe in some form of [[Real Presence]], like the Catholic, Lutheran and Orthodox churches, actually ''is'') the blood of Christ. Lutherans believe in the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist,&lt;ref name=WELSparticipation&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=814&amp;cuItem_itemID=1045 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102081951/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=814&amp;cuItem_itemID=1045 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=1 Corinthians 10:16 - Meaning of "Participation |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WELSQA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=258&amp;cuItem_itemID=8633 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102005853/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=258&amp;cuItem_itemID=8633 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Beliefs of other Church |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |quote=As [[Confessional Lutheran]]s we believe in baptismal regeneration, the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the Lord's Supper, and infant baptism. |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the body and blood of Christ are "truly and substantially present in, with and under the forms."&lt;ref name=WLS-Real&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BrugReal.pdf |title=The Real Presence of Christ’s Body and Blood in The Lord's Supper: Contemporary Issues Concerning the Sacramental Union |last=Brug |first=John F. |publisher=[[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]] |quote=Lutherans have always emphasized that Christ's true body and blood are really present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine and that Christ's true body and blood are received by all who receive the elements, either to their blessing or to their condemnation...Lutherans emphasize that although the presence of Christ in the Sacrament is a supernatural presence, which is beyond our understanding and explanations, it is a real, substantial presence.

On the other hand, some [[Protestant]] Christian denominations, such as [[Baptist]]s and [[Methodist]]s associated with the [[temperance movement]], encourage or require teetotalism. In some Protestant denomination, grape juice or non-alcoholic wine is used in place of wine to represent the blood of Christ.
 
The best known Western prohibition against alcohol happened in the United States in the 1920s, where concerned prohibitionists were worried about its dangerous side effects. However, the demand for alcohol remained and criminals stepped in and created the supply. The consequences of organized crime and the popular demand for alcohol, led to alcohol being legalized again.

==Islam==

Islam prohibits all drugs that are not medically prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam: Drugs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/isdrugsrev2.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's prohibition of drugs&lt;ref name=IslamO1&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Yusuf Al-Qaradawi]]|title=Islam Prohibits Alcohol and Drugs|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545310}}&lt;/ref&gt; stems from two concerns:
*their intoxication effects
*their harm to the human body

There are numerous verses in the Qur'an and hadith that ban ''[[khamr]]'' (intoxicants, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]). [[Muhammad]] said:&lt;ref name=IslamO1/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every intoxicant is like alcohol, and every (type of) alcohol is prohibited. ([[Sahih Muslim|Muslim]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second reason for banning drugs is that they are believed to have a harmful effect on the body. The Qur'an says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And make not your own hands contribute to your destruction." Surah, Al-Baqara, 2: 195&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Muslim nations of Turkey and Egypt were instrumental in banning [[opium]], [[cocaine]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] when the [[League of Nations]] committed to the 1925 International Convention relating to opium and other drugs (later the 1934 Dangerous Drugs Act). The primary goal was to ban opium and cocaine, but cannabis was added to the list, and it remained there largely unnoticed due to the much more heated debate over opium and coca. The 1925 Act has been the foundation upon which every subsequent policy in the [[United Nations]] has been founded. Cannabis use and abuse as an intoxicant was largely unknown in the West at that point, but Islamic leaders have been critical of it since the 13th century.

O You who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones and (divination by) arrows are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. Avoid (such abominations) that you may prosper. (5:90)

Satan’s plan is to sow hatred and enmity amongst you with intoxicants and gambling, and to hamper you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you not give up? (5:91)

There are no prohibitions in Islam on alcohol for scientific, industrial or automotive use.

In spite of these restrictions on substance use, tobacco and caffeine are still widely used throughout many Muslim nations.

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are forbidden to drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.  Accordingly, the sale and trafficking of such substances is also forbidden.  Smoking is discouraged but not prohibited.

==Rastafari movement==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Many [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] believe [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which they call "ganja," "the herb," or "Kaya," is a sacred gift of [[Jah]]. It may be used for spiritual purposes to commune with God, but should not be used profanely. The use of other drugs, however, including alcohol, is frowned upon. Many believe that the wine Jesus/Iyesus drank was not an alcoholic beverage, but simply the juice of grapes or other fruits.

While some Rastafari suggest that the Bible may refer to marijuana, it is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of [[Ancient Israel]], and those specializing in the lexicography of the [[Hebrew Bible]], that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers&lt;ref&gt;Dan Merkur ''The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible'' (2001); James D. Dure, ''Manna Magic Mushroom of Moses : Manna Botanical I.D. of a Biblical Sacrament'' (self published, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible, although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., [[John Allegro]] in relation to [[Qumran]], 1970) have been "widely dismissed as erroneous" (Merlin, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin  Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was [[Sula Benet]] (1967), who claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasoning ===
A "reasoning" is a simple event where the Rastas gather, smoke cannabis ("ganja"), and discuss. The person honored by being allowed to light the herb says a short sentence beforehand. The ganja is passed in a clockwise fashion (passing 'pon the lef' han' side) except in times of war, when it is passed counterclockwise. It is used to reason with Jah.

=== Groundation ===
A "groundation" (also spelled "grounation") or "binghi" is a holy day; the name "binghi" is derived from "Nyabinghi" (literally "Nya" meaning "black" and "Binghi" meaning "victory"). Binghis are marked by much dancing, singing, feasting, and the smoking of "ganja", and can last for several days.

=== Bible verses which Rastas believe justify cannabis use ===
...thou shalt eat the herb of the field.

Genesis 3.18

...eat every herb of the land.

Exodus 10:12

Better is a dinner of herb where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.

Proverbs 15:17

=== Beliefs about other drugs ===
According to many Rastas, the illegality of cannabis in many nations is evidence of persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, viewing Cannabis as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth – something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. Cannabis use is contrasted with the use of alcohol and other drugs, which they feel destroy the mind.

==Asatru==
Alcoholic drinks are commonly used during Asatru blots but non-alcoholic drinks can be substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenkindred.com/RBRituals.html|title=The Rituals of Asatru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/heathen_home/faq.html#11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and symptoms==

Earls and Lalumière (2009) describe it as "the sense of being in the wrong [species'] body...a desire to be an animal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Earls|first=Christopher M|last2=Lalumière|first2=Martin L|date=2009|title=A Case Study of Preferential Bestiality|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/xjw2736170737347/|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=|pages= 3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A term that has also been used is "transspecies", described by Phaedra and Isaac Bonewits as "people who believe themselves to be part animal, or animal souls that have been incarnated in human bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real Energy: Systems, Spirits, And Substances to Heal, Change, And Grow|last=Bonewits|first=Isaac|last2=Bonewits|first2=Phaedra|publisher=New Page Books|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species dysphoria may include:

* sensations of [[supernumerary phantom limb]]s associated with the species, such as phantom wings or claws&lt;ref&gt;Lupa (2007) ''A Field Guide To Otherkin.'' Megalithica Books. p. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[dysphoria]] associated with the feeling that one's body is of the wrong species&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Many find comfort in a form of transition, whether physical or social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theta.kinfire.org:80/?page_id=11|title=Therianthropy Education and Therapeutic Alliance - For Therapists|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304111301/http://theta.kinfire.org:80/?page_id=11|archive-date=4 March 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little research in surgeries towards the end of looking like another species, amongst what does exist, a 2008 paper by Samuel Poore in ''The Journal of Hand Surgery - American Volume'' details how a wing similar to that of a flightless bird could be constructed from a human arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O Poore|first=Samuel|date=2008|title=The Morphological Basis Of The Arm-to-Wing Transition|url=https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023(07)01042-8/abstract|journal=Journal of Hand Surgery - American Volume|volume=|pages=277–280|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a critical discussion of the work of Gerbasi ''et al.'' (2008), Fiona Probyn-Rapsey (2011) proposes that if "Species Identity Disorder" were to be treated, it may follow paths towards encouraging desistance, mirroring aims for desistance in the treatment of [[gender dysphoria in children]]; perhaps "redirecting a child’s attention away from cross-dressing as an animal" or "limiting the influence of humanimal creatures like stuffed toys".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Probyn-Rapsey|first=Fiona|date=2011|title=Furries and the Limits of Species Identity Disorder: A Response to Gerbasi et al.|url=https://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/probynrapsey.pdf|journal=Society &amp; Animals|volume=19|pages=294–301|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proposes alternatively that treatments "might involve counseling to learn to tolerate “atypical” humanimal development for those bothered by furries [with Species Identity Disorder]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Relationship to gender dysphoria ==
Though not all people with species dysphoria have [[gender dysphoria]], and vice versa, overlap exists. Some people experience both gender dysphoria and species dysphoria and consider them to be related in that they believe them to be similar dysphoric experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lupa (2007) ''A Field Guide To Otherkin.'' Megalithica Books''.'' p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

"Species dysphoria" is informally used mainly in psychological literature to compare the experiences of some individuals to those in the [[transgender]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of criminology and deviant behavior: Sexual deviance, Volume 3.|last=Bryant|first=Clifton D.|publisher=Brunner/Routledge|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the furry fandom ==
In a 2008 study by Gerbasi ''et al.'', amongst other things pursuing the potential of a condition termed "Species Identity Disorder", 46% of people surveyed who identified as being in the [[furry fandom]], answered "yes" to the question "Do you consider yourself to be less than 100% human?" and 41% answered "yes" to the question "If you could become 0% human, would you?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbasi|first=Kathleen C.|last2=Higner|first2=Justin|last3=Paolone|first3=Nicholas|last4=L.

Questions that Gerbasi states as being deliberately designed to draw parallels with gender dysphoria, specifying "a persistent feeling of discomfort" about the human body and the feeling that the person was the "non-human species trapped in a human body", were answered "yes" by 24% and 29% of respondents, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbasi|first=Kathleen C.|last2=Higner|first2=Justin|last3=Paolone|first3=Nicholas|last4=L.

== Relationship to zoophilia ==
Though not all people with species dysphoria are zoophilic, it has been proposed that there is comorbidity in some zoophiles by Beetz (2004), citing Miletski (2002) as evidence of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M Beetz|first=Andrea|date=2004|title=Bestiality/Zoophilia: A Scarcely Investigated Phenomenon Between Crime, Paraphilia, and Love|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Psychology Practice|volume=|pages= 26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miletski (2002), in a study contained in their book, involving 67 male and nine female zoophiles, found that 16 (24%) of the men reported that it was ‘‘completely or mostly true’’ that they began having sex with animals because they ‘‘identiﬁed with the animal of [their] gender’’, 0 women reported this, with 1 woman reporting it as "sometimes true" against 14 of the men reporting as "sometimes true".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://resources.pink.horse/books/understanding_bestiality_miletski.pdf|title=Understanding Bestiality and Zoophila|last=Miletski|first=Hani|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=978-0971691704|location=|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study by Williams and Weinberg surveyed 114 self identified zoophilic men and wrote that some admitted to "believing they had animal characteristics or that they felt like they were an animal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.

After the performance, Cárdenas reported that "some of these people call themselves [[Otherkin]], and feel deeply, truly, painfully that they were born as the wrong species, that they are foxes, dragons and horses.

[[File:Feminine Hygiene Products in a Walmart.png|thumb|Feminine hygiene products are subject to tax in a number of countries]]
A '''tampon tax''' is a popular term used to call attention to the fact that [[tampons]]—and other [[feminine hygiene]] products—are subject to [[value-added tax]], unlike the [[tax exemption]] status granted to other products considered basic necessities. Proponents of tax exemption argue that tampons, [[sanitary napkins]], [[menstrual cups]] and comparable products constitute basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt.

Proponents argue that feminine hygiene products serving the basic menstrual cycle should be classified alongside other unavoidable, [[tax exempt]] necessities, such as groceries and personal medical items.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; The [[BBC]] estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use [[feminine hygiene]] products for about a week each month for about 30 years.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; While [[sales tax]] policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed at the same rate as non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general [[consumption tax]] on sanitary products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; When asked about equivalent exemptions for men, proponents argue that no male products, [[condoms]] included, are comparable to feminine hygiene products, since menstruation is biological and "[[feminine hygiene]] is not a choice".&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; As the vast majority of consumers of feminine hygiene products are women, the increased cost has been criticized as being discriminatory against women.&lt;ref name="Hinckley Journal of Politics:Public Discourse of Policies Concerning Menstrual Taboo"/&gt; The tampon tax is not a special tax levied directly on feminine hygiene products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;

After the tax in Canada was removed mid-2015, women began protesting in other countries later that year.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On July 21, 2018, India eliminated the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 12% from sanitary napkins.

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom has levied a [[value-added tax (United Kingdom)|value-added tax]] on sanitary products since it joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. This rate was reduced to 5% specifically for sanitary products in 2000 with lobbying from [[Member of Parliament]] [[Dawn Primarolo]] saying that this reduction was "about fairness, and doing what we can to lower the cost of a necessity."&lt;ref name="theweek: UK News"/&gt; This is the lowest rate possible under the [[European Union]]'s [[European Union value added tax|value added tax law]], which as of 2015 does not allow zero rates. The [[UK Independence Party]] raised the issue in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] with promises to withdraw from the European Union and allow the zero rate. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] commented, when prompted, that the tampon tax campaign was "long-standing" and a complicated issue within the European Union.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; In England, one in ten women between 14 and 21 cannot afford menstrual management products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/plan-international-uks-research-on-period-poverty-and-stigma|title=Plan International UK's Research on Period Poverty and Stigma|last=|first=|date=December 20, 2017|website=Plan International UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/one-in-10-young-women-struggle-to-afford-pads-and-tampons-a8008671.html|title=Period Poverty: Why One in 10 Young Women Struggle to Afford Pads and Tampons|last=Rowlingson|first=Karen|date=October 21, 2017|website=The Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laura Coryton]] led a "Stop taxing periods, period" campaign with an online petition to have the European Union remove the value-added tax for sanitary products.&lt;ref name="Coryton"/&gt; [[George Osborne]] mentioned the petition by name in his 2015 [[Autumn Statement]] pledge to end the tampon tax at the European Union level. The petition platform's CEO cited the campaign as an example of successful [[clicktivism]],&lt;ref name="Clicktivism"/&gt; with over 320,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_student"/&gt; In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_Cameron"/&gt; It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so; several British women protested for it publicly while displaying blood stains from their periods.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On the 3rd October 2018, new EU VAT rules that will allow the UK to stop taxing sanitary products were approved by the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobarik: UK one step closer to ending the tampon tax |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/mobarik-uk-a-step-closer-to-ending-the-tampon-tax|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 October 2018|author=Nosheena Mobarik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In July 2017, a pilot program began in Scotland to have free sanitary products available at schools and food banks for women who cannot afford them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/access-sanitary-products-aberdeen-pilot-evaluation-report/pages/2/|title=Access to sanitary products Aberdeen pilot: evaluation report - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot scheme was launched for six months in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], with £42,500 of funding from the devolved [[Scottish Government]] in order to address the growing scandal of "period poverty". It was believed 1,000 girls would benefit from the scheme, as there were reports of teenage girls using tissues, toilet roll, torn T-shirts and even newspaper as makeshift sanitary products, with some girls even skipping school altogether. It was decided to launch the scheme to improve attainment and school attendance, as well as improve confidence amongst teenage girls during their period; and Scotland is believed to be the first country in the world to give out free sanitary products as part of a government-sponsored initiative.

Further to this half year pilot program, Scotland's opposition Labour Party intends to introduce a bill to make this permanent. Scotland is the first country to ban period poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-hampshire-43148080/period-poverty-helping-homeless-and-vulnerable-women |title=Period poverty: Helping homeless and vulnerable women - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2018-02-26 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the WHO and UNICEF showed that one out of five women in Scotland have been forced to improvise with items including toilet paper and old clothes due to the high cost of commercial products.

In the United States, almost all states tax "tangible individual property" but exempt non-luxury "necessities": groceries, [[medical prescription|prescriptions]], [[prosthetics]], agriculture supplies, and sometimes clothes—the exemptions vary between states.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Five states do not have a state sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon), and {{As of|2018|11|lc=yes}}, ten states specifically exempted essential hygiene products (Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/these-are-the-u-s-states-that-tax-women-for-having-per-1793848102|title=These are the U.S. states that tax women for having periods|last=Hillin|first=Taryn|work=Splinter|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ktnv.com/news/national/democracy-2018/election-results-2018-nevada-ballot-questions-1-6|title=Election Results 2018: Nevada Ballot Questions 1-6|work=KNTV|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., most states charge sales tax for women's pads and tampons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten states have dropped the tampon tax — Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida, according to NPR and CNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz |first=Andrea |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/07/health/nevada-tampon-tax-repealed-trnd/index.html |title=Nevada becomes the 10th state to eliminate 'pink tax' on menstrual products |publisher=CNN |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other states have introduced such legislation, most recently Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona. In January 2018, California rejected a proposal to eliminate tampon tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=2 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many federal assistance programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC (Women, Infants and Children) don’t allow the use of an EBT for products such as pads or tampons despite the products' classification as medical devices.  The IRS does not classify female products as medical devices, thus blocking women from buying them with pre-tax dollars in both flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2018/08/14/lack-feminine-hygiene-products-keeps-girls-out-school/948313002/|title=Teen girls are missing school because they don't have access to feminine hygiene products|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some changes to the tampon taxes but most of these changes are state level or by city. On a smaller scale, individual cities have also changed their laws in favor of eliminating the tampon tax. 

==== California ====
California Assemblywoman [[Cristina Garcia (politician)|Cristina Garcia]] reported that California women each pay roughly [[US$]]7 per month over 40 years, constituting US$20 million in annual taxes. Garcia and [[Ling Ling Chang]] proposed a bill to remove the tampon tax in early 2016. At this period, only a handful of the country's states exempted tampons, and several others had no state sales tax. Garcia held that women were taxed "for being women" and bore an economic burden for having no other choice but to buy these products. Garcia and Chang added that the tax was "regulatory discrimination" that disproportionately affected poor women and women of color, and that it likely persisted due to [[taboo|social taboos]] against discussing menstruation.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Both houses of the [[California State Legislature]] voted to exempt tampons from taxation in June 2016,&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; but the bill was vetoed by the state's governor, [[Jerry Brown]], three months later.&lt;ref name="Reuters: Cali veto"/&gt;

California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed AB-1561 due to the potential loss of money in taxing feminine hygiene products. In response, Cristina Garcia co-authored AB-0479: Common Cents Tax Reform Act with Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, which is a new measure outlining a solution to offset the feminine product and diaper tax exemption by increasing the tax on hard liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/13/theres-no-happy-hour-for-menstruation-tax-liquor-instead-of-tampons-lawmakers-say/?utm_term=.f1b7dfe6354e|title='There's no happy hour for menstruation': Tax liquor instead of tampons, lawmakers say|last=Phillips|first=Kristine|date=March 13, 2017|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, California State Legislature passed AB 10 requiring public middle schools and high schools where at least 40% of students meet the federal poverty level to stock half of the restrooms with free tampons and sanitary napkins. The law was passed in an effort to eliminate the cost burden and keep low-income students in schools during their menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB10|title=Bill Text  - AB-10 Feminine hygiene products: public school restrooms.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/TA/AC/PL/tier1.asp|title=Tier I Schools - Persistently Lowest-Achieving Schools (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies involved in supplying the necessary feminine hygiene products (tampons and pads) for complete menstrual care in the restrooms of schools include WAXIE and Hospeco. They also supply various options for menstrual product dispensers that have a time delay mechanism to prevent products from being overused and/or abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.waxie.com/ab10-menstrual-care|title=AB10 Menstrual Care {{!}} Waxie Sanitary Supply|last=Supply|first=WAXIE Sanitary|website=info.waxie.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hospeco.com/assets/user/documents/HSC_school_rules_L-HSC-0113-S_online.pdf|title=Do you know the new school rules?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hospeco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New York ====
In July 2016, New York State exempted feminine hygiene products from taxation, reducing the state's tax revenue by an estimated US$10 million annually.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY" /&gt; Connecticut and Illinois also removed their tax in 2016, with Florida following suit in 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC_Why" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff_Florida" /&gt;

==== New Jersey ====
A 2018 empirical study on New Jersey's 2005 tax break on menstrual products found that "repealing tampon taxes removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotropia|first=Christopher Anthony|last2=Rozema|first2=Kyle|date=2017|title=Who Would Benefit from Repealing Tampon Taxes? Empirical Evidence from New Jersey|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2999970|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2999970|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study utilized data from more than 16,000 purchases in 2004-2006 made in New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, using these latter nearby states as the control group. Through a differences-in-differences approach, they found that after the repeal, consumer prices on menstrual products decreased by 7.3%, relative to the control states. This was greater than the 6.9% sales tax, suggesting that the consumers benefitted from the tax break. Upon further analysis, the study also found that the decrease in consumer prices was greater for low-income consumers than high-income consumers (3.9% decrease versus 12.4% decrease).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This suggests that low-income consumers received the most benefit from the tax break, while high-income consumers shared the benefit with producers of menstrual products.

== Activism ==
Supporters of the exemption of said taxes are calling their efforts "menstrual equity", explaining it as a social movement that strives for feminine products like tampons to be considered necessities. Things that are considered necessities, for example toilet paper, are not taxed. Activists are often being led by members of government. Councilwomen Julissa Ferreras-Copeland led a movement with a tampon tax pilot project ultimately providing free pads and tampons at a local high school in Queens, New York. Ferreras-Copeland's effort has now been expanded into 25 different schools around New York City. Other democrats including Ydanis Rodriguez and council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito are advocating for state legislature to stop taxing sanitary products. 

Free the Tampon, an advocate for free menstrual products estimates that it would cost less than $5 a year per user to provide tampons and pads in restrooms at schools and businesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/new-york-city-bill-to-call-for-free-tampons-in-public-restrooms-shelters-and-jails/|title=New York City Bill to Call for Free Tampons in Public School Restrooms, Shelters and Jails|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|work=Well|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
