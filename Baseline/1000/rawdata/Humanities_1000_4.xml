[[File:Bertillon, Alphonse, fiche anthropométrique recto-verso.jpg|thumb|Anthropometric data sheet (both sides) of [[Alphonse Bertillon]], a pioneer in anthropological criminology]]
'''Anthropological criminology''' (sometimes referred to as '''criminal anthropology''', literally a combination of the study of the [[human]] species and the study of [[crime|criminals]]) is a field of [[offender profiling]], based on perceived links between the nature of a [[crime]] and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. Although similar to [[physiognomy]] and [[phrenology]], the term "criminal [[anthropology]]" is generally reserved for the works of the [[Italian school of criminology]] of the late 19th century ([[Cesare Lombroso]], [[Enrico Ferri]], [[Raffaele Garofalo]]). Lombroso thought that criminals were born with inferior physiological differences which were detectable. He popularized the notion of "born criminal" and thought that criminality was an [[atavism]] or [[hereditary]] disposition. His central idea was to locate crime completely within the individual and utterly divorce it from the surrounding social conditions and structures. A founder of the [[Positivist school]] of criminology, Lombroso opposed the social positivism developed by the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and [[environmental criminology]].

On the other hand, [[Alphonse Bertillon]] (1853&amp;ndash;1914) created a [[mugshot]] identification system for criminals prior to the invention of [[fingerprinting]]. [[Hans Gross]] (1847&amp;ndash;1915), leading worker in the field of [[criminology]] was also involved in the development of the theory.&lt;ref name="here"&gt;''Anthropological Criminology, North Carolina Wesleyan College, retrieved from [http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/301/301lect03.htm here] on March 10, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009044430/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/301/301lect03.htm |date=October 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Darwinism ==
The theory of anthropological criminology was influenced heavily by the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882). However, the influences came mainly from philosophy derived from Darwin's [[theory of evolution]], specifically that some species were morally superior to others. This idea was in fact spawned by [[Social Darwinism]], but nevertheless formed a critical part of anthropological criminology.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; The work of Cesare Lombroso was continued by Social Darwinists in the [[United States]] between 1881 and 1911.

==The theory==

In the 19th century, Cesare Lombroso and his followers, performed autopsies on criminals and declared that they had discovered similarities between the [[physiologies]] of the bodies and those of "primitive humans", monkeys and apes. Most of these similarities involved receding foreheads, height, head shape and size, and based on these Lombroso postulated the theory of the ‘born criminal’. Lombroso also declared that the female offender was worse than the male, as they had strong masculine characteristics.

Lombroso outlined 14 physiognomic characteristics which he and his followers believed to be common in all criminals: unusually short or tall height; small head, but large face; fleshy lips, but thin upper lip; protuberances (bumps) on head, in back of head and around ear; wrinkles on forehead and face; large sinus cavities or bumpy face; tattoos on body; receding hairline; bumps on head, particularly above left ear; large incisors; bushy eyebrows, tending to meet across nose; large eye sockets, but deep-set eyes; beaked or flat nose; strong jaw line; small and sloping forehead; small or weak chin; thin neck; sloping shoulders, but large chest; large, protruding ears; long arms; high cheek bones; pointy or snubbed fingers or toes.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

Lombroso published several works regarding his work, ''L'Uomo Delinquente'', ''L'Homme Criminel (The Criminal Man)'', ''The Female Offender'' (original titled ''Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman'') and ''Criminal Man, According to the Classification of Cesare Lombroso''.

==Rejection==

During Lombroso's life, British scientist [[Charles Buckman Goring]] (1870&amp;ndash;1919) was also working in the same area, and concluded that there were no noticeable physiological differences between law-abiding people and those who committed crimes. Maurice Parmelee, seen as the founder of modern criminology in America, also began to reject the theory of anthropological criminology in 1911, which led to its eventual withdrawal from the field of accepted criminology research.

==Modern times==

Despite general rejection of Lombroso's theories, anthropological criminology still finds a place of sort in modern criminal profiling. Historically (particularly in the 1930s) criminal anthropology had been associated somewhat with [[eugenics]] as the idea of a physiological flaw in the human race was often associated with plans to remove such flaws. This was found particularly in America, with the American Eugenics Movement between 1907 and 1939, and the [[Anti-miscegenation laws]], and also in Germany during the [[Third Reich]] where 250,000 mentally disabled Germans were killed.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

Criminal anthropology, and the closely related study of Physiognomy, have also found their way into studies of [[social psychology]] and [[forensic psychology]]. Studies into the nature of [[twins]] also combines aspects of criminal anthropology, as some studies reveal that identical twins share a likelihood of criminal activities more so than non-identical twins. Lombroso's theories are also found in studies of [[Galvanic skin response]] and [[XYY syndrome|XYY chromosome syndrome]].

:{{see also|Art valuation|Art auction}}
The art market is represented by a marketplace of buyers and sellers trading in the commodities, services, and works-of-art commonly associated with the various arts. The art market is also concerned with the production of new art which enters the art market. The art market is an example of one type of marketplace, among many different types of markets which occur in economics. In particular, the art market has many similarities with other marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet, as well as significant distinguishing factors indicative of its differences from other types of markets in economics.

==The art market economic model==
The [[Economics of the arts and literature#The market for artworks|art market]] operates in an economic model that considers more than [[supply and demand]]: it is a hybrid type of [[prediction market]] where art is bought and sold for values based not only on a work's perceived cultural value, but on both its past monetary value as well as its predicted future value. The market has been described as one where producers don't make work primarily for sale, where buyers often have no idea of the value of what they buy, and where middlemen routinely claim reimbursement for sales of things they have never seen to buyers they have never dealt with.&lt;ref name="platter"&gt;Plattner, Stuart, [http://www.stuartplattner.com/AA-ART-Paradox.pdf A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Market for Contemporary Fine Art], ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100(2):482-493, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the market is not transparent; private sales data is not systematically available&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private sales represent about half of market transactions.

===Market size===
Unlike the volumes in the [[securities market]] where millions of people and firms participate in buying and selling financial interests, or the [[Commodity market|commodities market]] where measures of raw or primary products are exchanged using standardized contracts, art market activity largely follows the demands of a more limited array of private collectors, museums, and large corporate interests as the principal market participants.&lt;ref name="microcosm"&gt;The art market sees itself as a microcosm: it lists its collectors in the hundreds, as opposed to the securities market which has millions of participants. ''ARTnews'': [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 The Top Ten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003020/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 |date=16 October 2009 }}, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 The ARTnews 200 Top Collectors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003056/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 |date=16 October 2009 }}. One art writer, however, answered the question: "Do you see the art world as a microcosm of other broader, power communities?" with the following observation: "I'm not sure if it's a microcosm or the shape of things to come. Its manic internationalism...." [http://www.vmagazine.com/2008/11/111208-insider-art/ Insider Art]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''V Magazine'', 2008-11-12, vmagazine.com.  Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate collectors, however, can have a disparately large market impact, for instance, ''[[Spear's Wealth Management Survey|Spear's]]'' reported in 2015 that [[British Rail]] began investing in art for its pension fund beginning in 1974 (prior to privatization), spending about £40M or approximately 3% of its funds on art, before selling those assets between 1987&amp;ndash;1999.&lt;ref name="britrailspears"&gt;Lindsay, Ivan, [http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/#.U4W0eSj8iZQ Go Figure], ''Spear's'', spearswms.com, 21 January 2011; free [https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052940/http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/ archived version]. Accessed 17 November 2015. The article also mentions that British Rail Pension realized an annualized return of 11.3% because of a number of factors particular to the market at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; British Rail's efforts realized profits, particularly due to the Impressionist portfolio, but the collection was liquidated because it came to be seen as an illegitimate investment area, particularly as alternative investments became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|last2=Spaenjers|first2=Christophe|date=November 2016|title=Organizational and epistemic change: The growth of the art investment field|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300782|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=55|pages=48–62|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because original artworks are not [[Fungibility|fungible]] like [[stock]]s, they have valuation challenges not similarly affecting securities,&lt;ref name="baumol"&gt;Baumol, William J., [http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf Unnatural Value: Or Art Investment as Floating Crap Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425235014/http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}, ''The American Economic Review'', 76:2 (May 1986), pp. 10-14, Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,; ''Journal of Arts Management and Law'' (now ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''), 15:3, 1985, pp. 47-60. {{DOI|10.1080/07335113.1985.9942162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with dynamics of what Karpik calls singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9215.html|title=Valuing the Unique|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, because the art market's participants are far more limited in number than the securities or commodities markets, because artworks are not fungible, and because art valuation relies to a great extent on the advice and enthusiasm of a variety of specialized market analysts, these limitations each in turn dictate the size of the market and increase the risk that some items may be over or undervalued.

===Market timing===
The art market moves in cycles with activity generally peaking in the spring and autumn when the major auction houses traditionally schedule auctions, and results in the market being seasonal rather than ongoing.&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;[http://www.artmarket.com/ Art Market Cycles], artmarket.com, retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  While private sales take place all year, those sales are often not publicized as auctions are and thus do not affect the market until they become known.

Art valuations made for an autumn auction may be unrealistic for the following spring auction season because fortunes in the financial markets during one season can affect the art market in the following season, and equity markets do significantly impact the art market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetzmann|first=William N|last2=Renneboog|first2=Luc|last3=Spaenjers|first3=Christophe|date=May 2011|title=Art and Money|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=222–226|doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volatility in the financial markets often causes volatility in the art market as happened in the contraction of the art market during the [[2008–2012 global recession|2008-2009 recession]]&lt;ref&gt;For more on the economic background causing the market contraction, see also the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence]].&lt;/ref&gt; when sales at [[Sotheby's]], [[Christie's]], and [[Phillips de Pury &amp;amp; Company]] were less than half the previous year: November 2008, $803.3 million compared to November 2007, $1.75 billion; and between 2000 and 2003 when the annual volume of art works sold at auction dropped 36%.&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contraction"&gt;Esterow, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 How to Buy in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015210756/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 |date=15 October 2009 }}, ''ARTnews'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, the art market can fare reasonably well despite volatility in the stock market such as happened from January 1997 through May 2004 when the average quarterly fluctuation in the Artprice Global Index was two to three times smaller than the same statistic for the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and the [[S&amp;P 500]].&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;

As art market participants' fortunes wax and wane in the financial markets, buying power evolves and affects participants' ability to afford highly valued works, resulting in new buyers and sellers entering, leaving, or re-entering the market, and an artwork sold to offset losses in the financial market might be sold for substantially more or substantially less than its last {{H:title|price for which work sold at auctioneer's hammer strike|hammer value|link=no}} at auction.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, Manuel, [http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf Primary Art Market Investments - A Safe Haven when All Else Suddenly Correlates?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002174957/http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf# |date=2013-10-02 }}, Prime Art Management Ltd., published in ''Art Fund Tracker'', Nov. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s during the stock-market boom, the art market expanded in turn with prices soaring to new heights, and investment firms took a greater interest in the art market and began to study it in-depth.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/39049d22.pdf The Art of Portfolio Diversification]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Maastricht University, March 2004. (art as an asset class)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goetzmann"&gt;Goetzmann, William N., Accounting for Taste: Art and the Financial Markets Over Three Centuries, ''The American Economic Review'', 83(5), Dec. 1993, pp. 1370-1376.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the previously non-transparent art market became more accessible via the increasing availability of indices and online data&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ"&gt;Campbell, R.A.J., [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID978467_code230208.pdf?abstractid=978467&amp;rulid=6936564&amp;mirid=1 Art as a Financial Investment], Erasmus Univ., Rotterdam, Maastricht Univ., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; although researchers discovered biased price estimates in the auction houses.&lt;ref name="mei"&gt;Mei, J. and Moses, M., [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jmei/estimates.pdf Vested Interest and Biased Price Estimates: Evidence from an Auction Market], ''The Journal of Finance'', 60(5), 2005, pp. 2409-2435.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art sometimes has transient fashionability that also can affect its value: what sells well for a time may be supplanted in the market by new styles and ideas in short order. For instance, in the spring of 2008 a collector offered over $80 million for Jeff Koons' stainless-steel ''Rabbit'', and yet a year later, of four works in the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York, only two of his pieces sold well and one failed to sell entirely.&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Christie's sold Koons' ''Balloon Flower'' sculpture for $16.9 million.&lt;ref name="koonsballoon"&gt;Christie's, [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/jeff-koons-balloon-flower/5371708/lot/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5371708&amp;sid=e5ce29ac-d2b6-41b6-9092-7aacf3e6974b Auction result, Sale 2355 / Lot 23], christies.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary markets===
The art market as a whole is affected by its two main parts: the primary art market, where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the primary market it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the primary market have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the primary market because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative.&lt;ref name="gerald"&gt;Gerard and Louis, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V64-3YRSMF4-28/2/44fafa98be1c97504c5a1fdc722b55ba On pricing the priceless: Comments on the economics of the visual art market], ''European Economic Review'', Elsevier, vol. 39(3-4), April 1995, pp. 509-518. (membership required).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as [[alpha consumer]]s (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing primary market works.

===Market entry barriers===
As with [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] stocks, works by "blue-chip" or well-known artists are generally valued more highly than works by unknown artists since it is hard to predict how an unknown artist's work will sell, or whether it will sell at all.

All these concerns are in play when gallerists set prices for emerging artists at a much lower level than for established artists.

===Market transparency===
With the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], the art market faced criticism for its lack of transparency, its [[Byzantinism|Byzantine]] valuation methods, and a perceived lack of ethical behavior enabled by structural inadequacies in the market itself. In response, a 2009 debate occurred between valuation-setting members of the art market on the proposition that "the art market is less ethical than the stock market". At the end of the debate the audience determined that those debating in agreement with the proposition won the debate.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;Saltz, Jerry, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/saltz/saltz3-6-09.asp Morality Play], artnet.com, 2009-03-06, discussing the debate and its outcome. Participants included art dealers Richard Feigen and Michael Hue-Williams, collector Adam Lindemann on the "pro" side, and artist [[Chuck Close]], critic Jerry Saltz, and auctioneer Amy Cappellazzo opposing. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpsTNdYeG6U debate video] is available on [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note in the debate was the identification of "chandelier bidding" as a practice perceived as ethically questionable. The debaters described "chandelier bidding" as bids from the chandelier, or bids from an unknown source, meaning both the bidding by the auction houses on behalf of the sellers whose items the houses are auctioning (a [[conflict of interest]]), and bidding by unidentified bidders having no intention of buying but bidding in order to drive prices up, all practiced because the auction houses keep secret from bidders a seller's [[Reservation price|reserve price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/design/as-art-market-rise-so-do-questions-of-oversight.html|title=As Art Market Soars, So Do Questions of Oversight|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=27 January 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=9 June 2017|last2=Flynn|first2=Kevin|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, also in response to criticism on the lack of market transparency and counterarguments that more transparency would ruin the market,&lt;ref name="adaa"&gt;Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), [http://www.artdealers.org/events.forum30.html Art Industry Summit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216122400/http://www.artdealers.org/events.forum30.html |date=16 December 2011 }}, Transparency in the market: can we have more of it?, 3 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' in association with the Art Dealers Association of America convened an Art Industry Summit panel discussion between major art market decision makers, where panelists discussed whether there was a need for more transparency.&lt;ref name="transpADAA"&gt;ADAA and The Art Newspaper, Transparency in the market...can we have more of it?, videos [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1662 Part 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193922/http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1662# |date=2016-03-04 }}, [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1661 Part 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172450/http://theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1661# |date=2016-03-05 }}, and [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1660 Part 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110955/http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1660# |date=2016-03-04 }}, Host Anna Somers Cocks, ''The Art Newpapaper'', 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists argued over whether auction houses have built-in conflicts of interest by representing sellers with secret reserves, while at the same time representing to buyers initial valuations on those works at auction time. The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.&lt;ref name="transpADAA2"&gt;ADAA, video 3 at 22:05 min, et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;

With the art market's weaknesses (especially lack of transparency and conflicts of interests) becoming better known, serious external conversations about market regulation have begun among major market players; for example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' noted that in early 2015, participants at the January [[World Economic Forum]] meeting attended a lunch seminar where the speaker warned that the global art market needs to be regulated because of systemic weaknesses which enable inside information trading, tax evasion, and money laundering.&lt;ref name="gapper"&gt;Gapper, John, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150125081849/http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2015/01/art-worlds-shady-dealings-under-scrutiny-at-davos Art world’s shady dealings under scrutiny at Davos], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 22 January 2015. Accessed 17 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of academic research, there is work on the opacity of price formation in finance and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Géraldine|last2=Oosterlinck|first2=Kim|last3=Szafarz|first3=Ariane|title=Art market inefficiency|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033|journal=Economics Letters|volume=121|issue=1|pages=23–25|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The late 1980s were a boom period for art auction houses. However, in early 1990, the market collapsed. The US overtook the EU as the world's largest art market&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Competitors ===
Christie's and Sotheby's are the leading auction venues. In 2002, [[LVMH]] acquired Swiss art advisory firm de Pury &amp; Luxembourg and merged it with Phillips to form [[Phillips de Pury &amp; Company]], with the aim of breaking the duopoly at the top of the market.

=== Segments ===
Fine art auctions are generally held separately for Impressionist and Modern art as well as for Post-war and Contemporary Art. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s works remain the most coveted lot as of 2004. In 2008 just over  million of art by [[Damien Hirst]] was sold at auction, a world record for a living artist; however in 2009, Hirst’s annual auction sales had shrunk by 93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/16990811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estimates ===
"Estimates" often reflect the [[consignor]]'s ambitions as much as the auction specialist's considered opinion. They do not reflect commissions. To secure consignments, auction houses concede high estimates to suit the requirements of art owners.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/arts/08iht-melikian08.html When Auction Estimates Go Haywire], ''[[The New York Times]]'', nytimes.com, October 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Before an auction, interested buyers typically turn for advice to the auction house specialist who quotes the estimate and often recommends going beyond in order to secure the item.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/arts/18iht-melik19.1.9319140.html Behind stellar sales of art market, a dangerous game], ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commissions and Buyer's Premium ===
Auction houses operate contractually on behalf of sellers of goods, charging sellers a fixed [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] (fee) amounting to a percentage of the “hammer price” for which a lot is sold.&lt;ref name="horror"&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = Hammer houses of horror
 | magazine = [[The Economist]]
 | date = July 24, 1997
 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/152446
 | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie's published its commissions in September 1995, with its fees ranging from 20% on the least expensive lots to 2% on lots sold for over m; Sotheby's followed suit.&lt;ref name="horror" /&gt; For Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, final prices include commission of 25% of the first  20% of the next  to  million, and 12% of the rest, with estimates not reflecting commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/arts/design/14auction.html Phillips Sale Totals Less Than Half the Low Estimate] ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, November 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Objects sold are also subject to a further fee called the "[[buyer's premium]]", 15% being typical, with the term implying that by virtue of selling an object, the auction house performs a service for the buyer subject to remuneration. Thus, both the seller and the buyer of an object or lot sold by the major auction houses pay a fee. First implemented in 1975 by Christie's, the assessment of a buyer's premium is one of several auction-house practices to which art dealers object.&lt;ref&gt;Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Kathryn Graddy, Anatomy of the Rise and Fall of a Pricefixing Conspiracy: Auctions At Sotheby’s And Christie’s, ''Journal of Competition Law and Economics'', 1(1), 3–20, March 2005, {{doi|10.1093/joclec/nhi003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance-based fees ===
Beginning in 2014, Christie's charged 2 percent of the hammer price of a work that meets or exceeds its high estimate. The fee does not apply to online only sales.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (September 26, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 Christie's takes another 2%] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928075542/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 |date=2014-09-28 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guarantees ===
An auction house may offer a guaranteed selling price, or "guaranteed minimum", a practice designed to give sellers confidence to consign works and to give potential bidders reassurance that there are others willing to buy an item.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thornton]], [https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/11/art-market Financial machinations at auctions], ''The Economist'', economist.com, November 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Auction houses have offered guarantees since the early 1970s to encourage collectors to sell their artworks: ''The Art Newspaper'' reported that guarantees were first introduced in 1971 at Sotheby’s, when 47 [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]s and other works from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] were offered with a guaranteed minimum; similar arrangements followed in 1972 and 1973 for the Ritter and Scull collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 2008 when the market turned sour, Christie's and Sotheby's had to pay out at least  million on works for which they guaranteed a minimum price but which failed to sell. In order to reduce their exposure to such losses, boost the market, and reduce volatility, the main auction houses now prefer that third parties take on this financial risk via "third-party guarantees" or "irrevocable bids": using this practice the auction houses sell a work to a third party for a minimum price prior to the auction and this selling price then becomes the “reserve” below which the artwork will not be sold. If bidding for specified works stops at the minimum price, which remains undisclosed, the "third party" acquires the lot; if bidding exceeds the reserve, the third party splits any profit from its sale with the consignor and with the auction house, the percentage going to each party varying with the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2003, Sotheby's abandoned its partnership with [[eBay]] after it lost millions through its various attempts to sell fine art over the internet.&lt;ref name="duopoly"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1612774 Just the two of us - The duopoly in fine-art auctions is weakened but very much alive] ''The Economist'', economist.com, February 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;


==What Counts==
The [[art sale|art market]] can also be used to understand what “counts” as part of art history. [[Art dealers]] and auctioneers organize material for distribution to collectors. Two of the largest, and oldest, art auction houses are [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]], and each hold frequent sales of great [[antiquities]] and [[Art Object|art objects]].

==Black Market==
In addition to upstanding practices, a [[black market]] exists for great art, which is closely tied to [[art theft]] and [[art forgery]]. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in [[illicit antiquities]] acquired through [[looting]] also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of [[Archaeological site|archeological sites]], [[looted art]] paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent [[archaeological looting in Iraq]].

'''Asian American Studies''' is an academic discipline which critically examines the history, experiences, culture, and policies relevant to [[Asian Americans]]. It is closely related to other [[Ethnic Studies]] disciplines, such as [[African American Studies]], [[Latino/a Studies]], and [[Native American Studies]]. 

==History==
Asian American Studies appeared as a field of intellectual inquiry in the late 1960s&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Hune. "Expanding the International Dimension of Asian American Studies". Amerasia Journal, Vol. 15 No. 2 (1989), pp.xix&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of strikes by the Third World Liberation Front, a group of students of color at [[San Francisco State University]] and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which demanded that college classroom instruction include the histories of people of color in the United States told from their perspectives. The demand for Ethnic Studies was a critical response to the Eurocentric bias in university curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiel |first=Crystal |date=March 8, 2009 |title=Celebration 40 Years: Third World Liberation Front |url=http://magandamagazine.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/celebrating-40-years-third-world-liberation-front/ |journal={m}aganda magazine |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a College of Ethnic Studies (the only such "college" at any American university at the time) became established at San Francisco State University with American Indian Studies, Asian American Studies, Africana Studies, and Latino/a Studies as its four units,&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Asian American Studies. &lt;http://www.sfsu.edu/~aas/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and four ethnic studies programs became established at the University of California, Berkeley. The [[Association for Asian American Studies]], a professional organization designed to promote teaching and research in the field, was established in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ABOUT {{!}} Association for Asian American Studies|url = http://aaastudies.org/about/|website = aaastudies.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in Asian American Studies==
Drawing from numerous disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[political science]], and [[gender studies]], Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. Unlike "Asian" Studies which focuses on the history, culture, religion, etc. of Asian people living in Asia, Asian American Studies is interested in the history, culture, experiences, of Asians living in the United States.

Academic programs in Asian American Studies provide students with the opportunity to examine the history of Asian-Americans, which includes topics such as immigration and race-based exclusion policies.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asian American Studies provides an academic avenue for addressing issues of racial oppression, capitalism at home, and imperialism abroad.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt; 

The discourse also includes studies on how [[Immigrant generation|first- and second-generation]] Asian Americans deal with adjustment and assimilation, especially on their Americanization and aggressive pursuit of higher education and prestigious occupations in a society that still discriminates against them.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian American Studies focuses on the identities, historical and contemporary experiences of individuals and groups in the United States. Concepts and issues that are crucial to this interdisciplinary curriculum include: [[Orientalism]], diaspora, Asian American masculinity, Asian American femininity, cultural politics, and media representation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Major Programs and Departments==
Major Asian American Studies programs in California include those at [[UC Berkeley]], [[UC San Diego]], [[UC Santa Barbara]], [[UC Irvine]],  [[UC Davis]], [[San Francisco State University]] (SFSU), [[California State University, Long Beach]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[California State University, Fullerton]], [[City College of San Francisco]], [[University of Southern California]], [[The Claremont Colleges]], and at [[UCLA]].

Outside of California, major programs include [[University of Washington]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], University of Maryland, College Park, [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], [http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/aasp/welcome-page Hunter College], [[Cornell University]], [[Binghamton University]], Duke University and [[Columbia University]]. Other rising programs include [[Arizona State University]], [[New York University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[University of Minnesota]]. Currently, several universities, including [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], [[University of Virginia]], [[Syracuse University]], and many others are in the process of developing Asian American Studies departments. 

Master of Arts in Asian American Studies programs are available at UCLA and SFSU.

At the time of its founding in 1987, the Asian American Studies Program at [[Cornell University]] was the first such program in the Ivy League and on the east coast. Today it has four core faculty members in the humanities and social sciences in a variety of departments and colleges. This cross-college, university-wide position accommodates the extensive teaching and research interests of the Program's faculty and reflects the breadth of the vibrant field of Asian American Studies in general. In the classroom, in scholarship, and through campus and community advocacy, the Program is committed to examining the histories and experiences; identities, social and community formations; politics; and contemporary concerns of people of Asian ancestry in the United States and other parts of the Americas.

On the East Coast, the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] created an Asian &amp; Asian American Studies Department after a 52 million dollar donation by Charles B. Wang (the founder of Computer Associates). The Charles B. Wang Center is designed as a vital space for multi-disciplinary and multicultural dialogues. The {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building was officially presented to Stony Brook University by Charles B. Wang on October 22, 2002. It was the largest single private gift ever received by the State University of New York 64-campus system. The Wang Center is used for conferences, art exhibits, film festivals, lectures, seminars, and performances. It is open to all Stony Brook students, faculty, and staff as well as the surrounding community.

[[Hunter College, City University of New York]], located in the [[Upper East Side]] in [[Manhattan]] is home to the only Asian American Studies Program in the [[CUNY]] system. The program was established in 1993 through student and faculty activism, with Peter Kwong as the inaugural director. Despite offering the largest number of Asian American Studies courses in [[New York City]], [[Hunter College]] does not have an Asian American Studies department nor does it offer an Asian American Studies major. In 2006, when the program was under threat of being cut, student activists formed [[The Coalition for the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter]] to fight to keep Asian American Studies. The students succeeded in saving the minor program, and they continue to fight for an Asian American Studies major and department. 

[[Queens College, City University of New York]], located in the neighborhood of [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in [[New York City]], is home to the [https://www.qc.cuny.edu/academics/centers/asian/Pages/homepage.aspx Asian/American Center]. It was established to conduct research with community needs in mind. It serves as a hub for research into Asian American issues, particularly focusing on the Asian diaspora in the New York area, and offers a minor in Asian American Community Studies (AACS).

'''''Bokuseki''''' (墨跡) is a Japanese term meaning "ink trace", and refers to a form of Japanese calligraphy  ([[Shodo]]) and more specifically a style of [[Zenga]] developed by [[Zen]] monks. Bokuseki is often characterized by bold, assertive, and often abstract brush strokes meant to demonstrate the calligrapher’s pure state of mind (see [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|Samadhi]]). The aim in making Bokuseki is  to represent ones single-moment awareness by brushing each word or passage with a single breath, ultimately realizing Zen and manifesting ones [[Zazen]] practice into physical and artistic action. Fundamentally Bokuseki is a reflection of one's spontaneous action (see: [[Buddha-nature]], [[Katsu (Zen)|katsu]]) free from one’s superficial or [[Rationality|rationally]] oriented mind.

In the arts, '''bricolage''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[DIY]]" or "do-it-yourself projects") is the construction or creation of a work from a diverse range of things that happen to be available, or a work created by mixed media.

The term ''bricolage'' has also been used in many other fields, including [[anthropology]], philosophy, critical theory, education, computer software, and business.

==Origin==
''Bricolage'' is a French [[loanword]] that means the process of [[improvisation]] in a human endeavor. The word is derived from the French verb ''bricoler'' ("to tinker"), with the English term [[DIY]] ("Do-it-yourself") being the closest equivalent of the contemporary French usage. In both languages, ''bricolage'' also denotes any works or products of DIY endeavors.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |last= Baldick |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Baldick |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn= 9780199208272 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=dictionary%20of&amp;pg=PA42 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broady&gt;{{Cite book |title=Colloquial French 2: The Next step in Language Learning |last=Broady |first=Elspeth |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-26647-5 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JM2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==

===Music===
Instrumental bricolage in music includes the use of [[found object]]s as instruments, such as:

*[[Spoon (musical instrument)|Spoons]]
*[[Musical saw]]
*Australasian [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]] made from a [[tea chest]]
*Comb and wax paper for [[humming]] through
*[[eucalyptus|Gumleaf]] humming
*[[Lagerphone]] (made from a stick and bottle tops)
*[[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[steelpan|steel drums]] (made from [[drum (container)|industrial storage drums]])
*[[African drums]] and [[thumb piano]]s made from recycled pots and pans.
*American super instruments made from recorders and bicycle bells or metal rods and keys
*[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp dancing]] is an example of the use of bricolage in music and dance, utilizing everyday objects, such as trash cans and broom sticks, to produce music.
*Many of the musical instruments created by American composer [[Harry Partch]] utilize unusual items, such as automotive [[hubcap]]s and [[pyrex]] [[carboy]]s.

Stylistic bricolage is the inclusion of common musical devices with new uses.  Shuker writes, "Punk best emphasized such stylistic bricolage".&lt;ref&gt;Shuker ''Popular Music: Key Concepts'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical bricolage flourishes in music of sub-cultures where: 
*experimentation is part of daily life (pioneers, immigrants, artistic communities),
*access to resources is limited (such as in remote, discriminated or financially disconnected sub-cultures) which limits commercial influence (e.g. acoustic performers, ghetto music, hippie, folk or traditional musicians), and
*there is a political or social drive to seek individuality (e.g. rap music, peace-drives, drummers' circles)

Unlike other bricolage fields, the intimate knowledge of resources is not necessary. Many punk musicians, for instance, are not musically trained, because they believe training can discourage creativity in preference for accuracy. Also, careful observation and listening is not necessary, it is common in spontaneous music to welcome 'errors' and disharmony. Like other bricolage fields, bricolage music still values trusting one's ideas and self-correcting structures such as targeted audiences.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Visual art===
In art, bricolage is a technique or creative mode, where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand, and is seen as a characteristic of many [[postmodern]] works.

These materials may be [[mass-produced]] or "junk". See also: [[Kurt Schwitters|Merz]], [[polystylism]], [[collage]], [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]].

Bricolage can also be applied to [[Improvisational theatre|theatrical forms of improvisation]], where the main strategy is to use the environment and materials at hand. The environment is the stage and the materials are often pantomimed. The use of the stage and the imaginary materials are all made up on the spot, so the materials which are at hand are actually things that the players know from past experiences (i.e. an improvisation of ordering fast food: One player would start with the common phrase "How may I help you?").

Bricolage is also applied in [[interior design]], through blending styles and accessorizing spaces with what is "on hand". Many designers use bricolage to come up with innovative and unique ideas.

===Architecture===
Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bricolage |title=bricolage - definition of bricolage by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of [[Le Corbusier]], by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book ''Collage City'', suggesting that he assembled ideas from found objects of the [[history of architecture]]. This, in contrast to someone like [[Mies Van der Rohe]], whom they called a "hedgehog", for being overly focused on a narrow concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Academics==

===Literature===
In literature, bricolage is affected by [[intertextuality]], the shaping of a text's meanings by reference to other texts.

===Cultural studies===
In [[cultural studies]] bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across [[social division]]s to create new [[cultural identity|cultural identities]]. In particular, it is a feature of [[subculture]]s such as the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement. Here, objects that possess one meaning (or no meaning) in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new, often subversive meaning. For example, the [[safety pin]] became a form of decoration in punk culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, Dick. ''Subculture: the Meaning of Style.'' London: Routledge, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology&lt;!--linked from 'Claude Lévi-Strauss'--&gt;===
The term "psychological bricolage" is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess. 
The term, introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Matthew J. Karlesky and Fiona Lee&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. (in press). Psychological Bricolage and the Creative Process. In C. Shalley, M. Hitt, and J. Zhou (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOEwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=oxford+creativity+bricolage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9YO2B5AYJD&amp;sig=fUzbuH-bEH_OB4D3iaqMu-DbRjk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J3MgVbe9KcjosAXC1oGABw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20creativity%20bricolage&amp;f=false] of the [[University of Michigan]], draws from two separate disciplines.  The first, “social bricolage,” was introduced by cultural anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in 1962. Lévi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness. The second, "creative cognition,” is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways.  Psychological bricolage, therefore, refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. "Psychological Bricolage, Integrating social identities to produce creative solutions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Shalley, M. Hitt, &amp; J. Zhou. Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to [[Karl E. Weick]]’s notion of bricolage in organizations, which is akin to Lévi-Strauss' notion of bricolage in societies.&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Karl Weick, "Organizational Redesign as Improvisation", reprinted in ''Making Sense of the Organization''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
In his book ''[[The Savage Mind]]'' (1962, English translation 1966), French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] used  "bricolage" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought. In his description it is opposed to the engineers' creative thinking, which proceeds from goals to means. Mythical thought, according to Lévi-Strauss, attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Lévi-Strauss |title=La Pensée sauvage |location=Paris |year=1962 }} English translation as ''The Savage Mind'' (Chicago, 1966). {{ISBN|0-226-47484-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |title=Bricolage [Tesugen&amp;#93; |publisher=Tesugen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035434/http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varenne.tc.columbia.edu/bib/info/levstcld066savamind.html |title=Varenne: quotes from Lévi-Strauss (1963 [1962&amp;#93;) |publisher=Varenne.tc.columbia.edu |date=1999-05-11 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] extends this notion to any discourse. "If one calls ''bricolage'' the necessity of borrowing one's concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is ''bricoleur''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacques |last=Derrida |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |url=http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/derrida/sign-play.html |title=Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences |publisher=Hydra.humanities.uci.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], in their 1972 book ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]'', identify ''bricolage'' as the characteristic [[mode of production]] of the schizophrenic producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]: Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. Trans. Robert Hurley, Mark Seem, and Helen R. Lane. Continuum edition. London: Continuum, 2004 (1972). p.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In the discussion of [[Constructionism_(learning_theory)|constructionism]], [[Seymour Papert]] discusses two styles of solving problems. Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems, he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying, testing, playing around.

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and [[Shirley R. Steinberg]] have used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods. In Kincheloe's conception of the research bricolage, diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry. Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies, researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena.

Kincheloe and Steinberg theorize a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage. These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world. Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience. Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological, mimetic research orientations (see Kincheloe, 2001, 2005; Kincheloe &amp; Berry, 2004; Steinberg, 2015; Kincheloe, McLaren, &amp; Steinberg, 2012).

==Information technology==

===Information systems===
In [[information systems]], bricolage is used by [[Claudio Ciborra]] to describe the way in which [[strategic information system]]s (SIS) can be built in order to maintain successful [[competitive advantage]] over a longer period of time than standard SIS. By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up, rather than implementing it from the top-down, the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the [[organisational culture]] that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Ciborra, Claudio (1992). "From Thinking to Tinkering: The Grassroots of Strategic Information Systems", ''The Information Society'' 8, 297–309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
In her book ''[[Life on the Screen]]'' (1995), [[Sherry Turkle]] discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity.  She advocates the "bricoleur style" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured "planner" approach.  In this style of coding, the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification, opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process.  In her essay "Epistemological Pluralism", Turkle writes: "The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turkle |first=Sherry |url=http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html |title=Epistemological Pluralism |publisher=Papert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==
The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work. To reach this stage, artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines, as well as information from their own social identities.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbledick, Susie. "Information-Seeking Behavior of Artists: Exploratory Interviews."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the artist [[Shirin Neshat]] has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex, creative and critical bodies of work.&lt;ref&gt;2010 TED Talk, "Shirin Neshat: Art in Exile."&lt;/ref&gt; This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets. This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee, who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Cheng, C. &amp; Lee, F. "Increasing Innovation Through Identity Integration."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[Karl Weick]] identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations.&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;
 
*Intimate knowledge of resources
*Careful observation and listening
*Trusting one's ideas
*Self-correcting structures, with feedback

Nasim Nicholas Taleb mentions it in his book ''[[Antifragile]]''.

==In popular culture==

===Fashion===
In his essay "Subculture: The Meaning of Style", [[Dick Hebdige]] discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they "appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings".&lt;ref&gt;"Subculture: The Meaning of Style". Dick Hebdige. In ''Cultural Studies: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael Ryan. 2008. p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes. For example, candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse. The movie ''[[Zoolander]]'' parodies this concept with "Derelicte", a line of clothing made from trash.

===Television===
* ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Bogost |title=Comparative Video Game Criticism |url=http://gac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/41 |work= [[Games and Culture]] |volume= 1, No. 1 |pages=41–46 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects.

A '''comedy club''' is a venue—typically a [[nightclub]], [[bar (establishment)|bar]], [[casino]], or [[restaurant]]—where people watch or listen to performances, including [[stand-up comedian]]s, improvisational [[comedian]]s, [[impersonator]]s, [[impressionist]]s, [[magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[ventriloquist]]s, and other comedy acts. The term "comedy club" usually refers to venues that feature stand-up comedy, as distinguished from [[improvisational theatre]]s, which host improv or sketch comedy, and variety clubs (which may also host musical acts).

==Types of comedy clubs==
Comedy clubs are usually broken down by comedians into "A rooms", "B rooms", and "C rooms":
*A rooms usually cater to people with movie deals, people with television shows, and generally well known acts.
*B rooms are where the best aspects of both A rooms and C rooms meet. Young comics need B rooms as a stepping stone. These are rooms where someone doing a 10- to 15-minute set (hosting/MCing) can be asked, after they've been going up long enough, to do a 20-minute set (featuring) and so on. These clubs also typically allow dirtier material, since they can become established names for "dirty" comedy or shows that usually cover adult themes.
*C rooms act as "neighborhood" comedy clubs, for the most part. The headliners are not usually very well known or popular, and the audiences are random walk-ins.

In The [[United States]] [[criminal justice system]], a '''Courtroom Workgroup''' is an informal arrangement between a criminal [[prosecutor]], [[criminal defense attorney]], and the [[judicial officer]]. This foundational concept in the academic discipline of [[criminal justice]] recharacterizes the seemingly adversarial courtroom participants as collaborators in "doing justice." The courtroom workgroup was proposed by Eisenstein and Jacob in 1977 to explain their observations of the ways courts, especially lower level courts, actually come to decisions.

Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works, it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants. The academic theory of the courtroom workgroup has four cornerstone concepts that recognize this fact: Speed, Pragmatic Cynicism, Collegiality, and Secrecy. Efficient courtroom workgroups seek to process cases rather than dispense justice. This has been confirmed to greater and lesser extents in different courts.  [[Defendant]]s are assumed to be guilty. The procedural merits of the case are the true determinative factors of an outcome. Prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in a comparison of charges against possible procedural flaws and possible defenses to arrive at the going rate for a crime.  These factors are used to determine how much punishment the plea bargain will offer.  For example, group relationships and the desire to "maintain" a healthy working relationship are important to group members. The workings of the courtroom group and the "going rate" for given crimes are not matters for public disclosure. Estimates can be given to clients, but usually couched in terms of the prosecution's willingness to negotiate. (Summarized by O'Connor, T.R., 2005)

The courtroom workgroup is a mechanism for [[prosecutorial discretion]].  Various techniques are used to convince the defendant that the evidence against him or her is overwhelming.  “Charge stacking” is a process by which police and prosecutors create a case with numerous charges or numerous instances of the same charge to convince the defendant that the risk of not pleading guilty is intolerable.  The defendant may be convinced to plead guilty to a few of the charges in return for not being prosecuted for the remaining charges.

The courtroom workgroup is, in some sense, a response to a lack of resources for public defenders.  Defense attorneys in public defender offices often do not have sufficient time to prepare a case in detail for all of their clients.  Further, they often do not have the budget to fully investigate the facts of a case through either staff or private investigators.  They often must rely solely on police reports for such information.  In some jurisdictions, clients do not meet their attorneys until they are in court.  Typically, public defenders will meet briefly with clients in holding facilities or jails.  The defense attorney defends his or her client by seeking less punishment.  Huemann (1977) indicates that many defense attorneys feel pressured to keep up with their caseloads.  This pressure can manifest in the courtroom through rebukes by the judge for delays.  Many subtle pressures combine to encourage participation in the courtroom workgroup.

The concept of a courtroom workgroup is associated with plea bargaining. The courtroom workgroup shows remarkable explanatory power in overburdened courts dealing with large caseloads.  The courtroom workgroup model is best suited to explain jurisdictions where defense attorneys are more or less permanently assigned, but even occasionally appointed lawyers can participate in these practices. While many of the higher level prosecutions still follow the adversarial model, there is evidence that lower-level proceedings follow the courtroom workgroup model. Boland, Brady, Tyson, &amp; Bassler (1983) indicate that approximately 90 percent of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain. This figure appears to be stable over the last twenty years (Rainville &amp; Reaves, 2003). Some collaborative efforts on the part of the courtroom workgroup simply must be present to facilitate this high percentage of pleas.

{{Anthropology |theories}}

'''Cross-cultural studies''', sometimes called '''holocultural studies''' or '''comparative studies''', is a specialization in [[anthropology]] and sister sciences ([[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[political science]]) that uses field data from many [[Society|societies]] to examine the scope of [[human behavior]] and test hypotheses about human behavior and culture. Cross-cultural studies is the third form of cross-cultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is controlled comparison among variants of a common derivation,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and the third is comparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines similar characteristics of a few societies, cross-cultural studies uses a sufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show relationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These studies are surveys of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] data.

Cross-cultural studies are applied widely in the [[social science]]s, particularly in [[cultural anthropology]] and [[psychology]].

==History==
The first cross-cultural studies were carried out by 19th-century anthropologists such as [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and [[Lewis H. Morgan]]. One of Edward Tylor's first studies gave rise to the central statistical issue of cross-cultural studies: [[Galton's problem]]. In the recent decades historians and particularly historians of science started looking at the mechanism and networks by which knowledge, ideas, skills, instruments and books moved across cultures, generating new and fresh concepts concerning the order of things in nature. In ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges in the Eastern Mediterranean 1560–1660'' Avner Ben-Zaken has argued that cross-cultural exchanges take place at a cultural hazy locus where the margins of one culture overlaps the other, creating a "mutually embraced zone" where exchanges take place on mundane ways. From such a stimulating zone, ideas, styles, instruments and practices move onward to the cultural centers, urging them to renew and update cultural notions.&lt;ref&gt;Avner Ben-Zaken, "From "Incommensurability of Cultures" to Mutually Embraced Zones" in ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges In the Eastern Mediterranean 1560-1660'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010)], pp. 163-167. {{ISBN|9780801894763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era of cross-cultural studies==

The modern era of cross-cultural studies began with [[George Murdock]] (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Whiting (1986:305)&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock set up a number of foundational data sets, including the [[Human Relations Area Files]], and the ''Ethnographic Atlas.'' Together with [[Douglas R. White]], he developed the widely used [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], currently maintained by the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] electronic journal [[World Cultures]].

A '''cultural system''', is the interaction of different elements in [[culture]]. While a cultural system is very different from a [[social system]], sometimes both systems together are referred to as the [[sociocultural system]].

==Social theory==
A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of integration of cultural and social factors.

===Action theory===
[[Talcott Parsons]], a major figure in sociology, who was the main originator of [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman (2004) summarize Parsons view, "Parsons saw these action systems acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower levels." In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term "functionalism" was an inappropriate characterization of his theory.

===System and social integration===
The British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between social content and social transmission in his work on social [[structure and agency]]. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and transmission. Lockwood's conceptual distinction influenced [[Jürgen Habermas]]' discussion in the classic ''Legitimation Crises'', who made the now famous distinction between system integration and social integration of the lifeworld.

===Cultural and socio-cultural integration===
[[Margaret Archer]] (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work ''Culture and Agency'', argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and later by [[Mary Douglas]], is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons' approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by [[Antonio Gramsci]] through the theory of [[cultural hegemony]] through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4)

Archer, a proponent of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], suggests that cultural factors can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in the transmitted culture.  Cultural systems are used (and inform society) both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To quote Archer in this regard:
: "logical consistency is a property of the world of ideas; causal consistency is a property of people. The main proposition here is the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence can vary independently of one another. Thus it is perfectly conceivable that any social unit, from a community to a civilization, could be found the principle ideational elements (knowledge, belief, norms, language, mythology, etc.) of which do display considerable logical consistency&amp;nbsp;– that is, the components are consistent, not contradictory&amp;nbsp;– yet the same social unit may be low on causal consensus. " (2004:4)

Archer notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors with various levels of contradiction and consistency.

==Research==	
According to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of culture, in the 1980-1990s, the "cultural studies" and "cultural indicators" approaches, investigators explored the traditionally functionalist concern of "cultural systems integration." These two approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems. Burrowes (1996) writes, "If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies." Constrained by Merton's [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] [note: to be discussed here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social systems and their interaction.

''''' Der Bäbu ''''' (''The Baboo'') is a [[Comic opera]] in three acts by [[Heinrich Marschner]]. The German libretto by Wilhelm August Wohlbrück (Marschner's brother-in-law) is based on the book ''The Baboo and Other Tales Descriptive of Society in India. Smith, Elder, and Co., London 1834'' by [[Augustus Prinsep]]. The first performance took place on 19 February 1838 in [[Hanover]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">A '''destruction layer''' is a [[stratum]] found in the excavation of an [[archaeological site]] showing evidence of the hiding and burial of valuables, the presence of widespread fire, mass murder, unburied corpses, loose weapons in public places, or other evidence of destruction, either by natural causes (for example earthquakes), or as a result of a military action.

Destruction layers are often found associated with a change in subsequent pottery styles or material culture artefacts, indicating an invasion by a foreign people or intrusive element. Finding such destruction layers in a number of related sites may indicate a collapse of a state, especially if associated with an appearance of a markedly different culture in upper horizons.

==Archaeological sites with destruction layers==
The city of [[Troy]] shows two famous destruction layers, Level 2 (dated approximately 2200 BCE) and Level 7 (dated approximately 1200 BCE, and linked with the [[Trojan War]]). The destruction layers associated with [[Knossos]] in Crete was for a long time associated with the invasion of Archaeans led by [[Theseus|Thesius]], until it was proven by [[Michael Ventris]] that the [[Linear B]] syllabary was a form of early Greek language. The destruction of the cities of the [[Mycenaean Greece]] were for a long time associated with arrival of the [[Dorians]], before closer excavation showed that these destructions were not contemporaneous, and in fact pre-dated the so-called "Dorian invasions" by a century or more. The volcanic explosion of [[Minoan eruption|Thera]]&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Christopher Bronk; Manning, Sturt W.; Galimberti, Mariagrazia (2004)"Dating the Volcanic Eruption at Thera" (Radiocarbon, Volume 46, Issue 1, Pages xiii-496 (January 2004) , pp. 325-344(20))&lt;/ref&gt; shows a destruction layer at the town of [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] thought by some to have been the origins of the story of Atlantis.  The cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] and [[Harrappa]] show destruction layers associated with their subsequent abandonment, and for a long time this was attributed to [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan invaders]].

Destruction layers form an important part of the study of [[Biblical archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Israel and Eli Piasetzky (2003), "Comment on 14C Dates from Tel Rehov: Iron-Age Chronology, Pharaohs, and Hebrew Kings"(Science 24 October 2003: Vol. 302. no. 5645, p. 568)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialectic''' or '''dialectics''' ({{lang-grc-gre|διαλεκτική}}, ''dialektikḗ''; related to [[dialogue]]), also known as the '''dialectical method''', is at base a [[discourse]] between two or more people holding different [[Opinion|points of view]] about a subject but wishing to establish the [[truth]] through [[Rationality|reasoned]] arguments. Dialectic resembles [[debate]], but the concept excludes subjective elements such as emotional appeal and the modern [[pejorative]] sense of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;see [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]], 449B: "Socrates: Would you be willing then, Gorgias, to continue the discussion as we are now doing [Dialectic], by way of question and answer, and to put off to another occasion the (emotional) speeches [Rhetoric] that [the Sophist] Polus began?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Corbett|first=Edward P. J.|title=Classical Rhetoric For the Modern Student|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195115420|page=1, 18|edition=4th|author2=Robert J. Connors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialectic may be contrasted with the [[didactic method]], wherein one side of the conversation teaches the other. Dialectic is alternatively known as minor [[logic]], as opposed to major [[logic]] or [[critique]].

Within [[Hegelianism]], the word ''dialectic'' has the specialised meaning of a [[contradiction]] between ideas that serves as the determining factor in their relationship. Dialectic comprises three stages of development: first, a thesis or statement of an idea, which gives rise to a second step, a reaction or antithesis that contradicts or negates the thesis, and third, the synthesis, a statement through which the differences between the two points is resolved. [[Dialectical materialism]], a theory or set of theories produced mainly by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], adapted the Hegelian dialectic into arguments regarding traditional [[materialism]].

Dialectic tends to imply a ''process'' of evolution and so does not naturally fit within [[formal logic]] (see [[logic and dialectic]]). This process is particularly marked in Hegelian dialectic and even more so in Marxist dialectic which may rely on the evolution of ideas over longer time periods in the real world; [[dialectical logic]] attempts to address this.

== Western dialectical forms ==
=== Classical philosophy ===
In [[Classical Greece|classical]] [[philosophy]], dialectic ({{lang|el|διαλεκτική}}) is a form of reasoning based upon dialogue of arguments and counter-arguments, advocating ''[[proposition]]s'' ([[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|theses]]) and ''counter-propositions'' ([[antithesis|antitheses]]). The outcome of such a dialectic might be the refutation of a relevant proposition, or of a synthesis, or a combination of the opposing assertions, or a qualitative improvement of the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A. J., &amp; O'Grady, J. (1992). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Quotations''. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers. p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McTaggart, J. M. E. (1964). A commentary on Hegel's logic. New York: Russell &amp; Russell. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the term "dialectic" owes much of its prestige to its role in the philosophies of [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], in the Greek [[Classical Greece|Classical]] period (5th to 4th centuries BCE). [[Aristotle]] said that it was the pre-Socratic philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] who invented dialectic, of which the dialogues of Plato are the examples of the Socratic dialectical method.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], IX 25ff and VIII 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], however, the ancient Greeks used the word "dialectic" to signify the logic of false appearance or semblance. To the Ancients, "it was nothing but the logic of illusion. It was a sophistic art of giving to one's ignorance, indeed even to one's intentional tricks, the outward appearance of truth, by imitating the thorough, accurate method which logic always requires, and by using its topic as a cloak for every empty assertion."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Socratic method ====
{{main|Socratic method}}
The [[Socratic dialogues]] are a particular form of dialectic known as the [[method of elenchus]] (literally, "refutation, scrutiny"&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elenchus&lt;/ref&gt;) whereby a series of questions clarifies a more precise statement of a vague belief, logical consequences of that statement are explored, and a contradiction is discovered. The method is largely destructive, in that false belief is exposed&lt;ref&gt;https://open.conted.ox.ac.uk/sites/open.conted.ox.ac.uk/files/resources/Create%20Document/PLA_HO3_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and only constructive in that this exposure may lead to further search for truth. The detection of error does not amount to a proof of the antithesis; for example, a contradiction in the consequences of a definition of ''piety'' does not provide a correct definition. The principal aim of Socratic activity may be to improve the soul of the interlocutors, by freeing them from unrecognized errors; or indeed, by teaching them the spirit of inquiry.

In common cases, Socrates used [[enthymemes]] as the foundation of his argument.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

For example, in the ''[[Euthyphro]]'', Socrates asks [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] to provide a definition of piety. Euthyphro replies that the pious is that which is loved by the gods. But, Socrates also has Euthyphro agreeing that the gods are quarrelsome and their quarrels, like human quarrels, concern objects of love or hatred. Therefore, Socrates reasons, at least one thing exists that certain gods love but other gods hate. Again, Euthyphro agrees. Socrates concludes that if Euthyphro's definition of piety is acceptable, then there must exist at least one thing that is both pious and impious (as it is both loved and hated by the gods)—which Euthyphro admits is absurd. Thus, Euthyphro is brought to a realization by this dialectical method that his definition of piety is not sufficiently meaningful.

For example, in Plato's Gorgias, dialectic occurs between Socrates, the Sophist Gorgias, and two men, Polus and Callicles. Because Socrates' ultimate goal was to reach true knowledge, he was even willing to change his own views in order to arrive at the truth. The fundamental goal of dialectic, in this instance, was to establish a precise definition of the subject (in this case, rhetoric) and with the use of argumentation and questioning, make the subject even more precise.  In the Gorgias, Socrates reaches the truth by asking a series of questions and in return, receiving short, clear answers.
    
There is another interpretation of the dialectic, as a method of intuition suggested in The Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.]] (1962) [[The Open Society and its Enemies]], Volume 1, London, Routledge, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Blackburn writes that the dialectic in this sense is used to understand "the total process of enlightenment, whereby the philosopher is educated so as to achieve knowledge of the supreme good, the Form of the Good".&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon.  1996.  The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy.  Oxford: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aristotle ====
Aristotle stresses that rhetoric is closely related to dialectic. He offers several formulas to describe this affinity between the two disciplines: first of all, rhetoric is said to be a “counterpart” (antistrophos) to dialectic (Rhet. I.1, 1354a1); (ii) it is also called an “outgrowth” (paraphues ti) of dialectic and the study of character (Rhet. I.2, 1356a25f.); finally, Aristotle says that rhetoric is part of dialectic and resembles it (Rhet. I.2, 1356a30f.). In saying that rhetoric is a counterpart to dialectic, Aristotle obviously alludes to Plato's Gorgias (464bff.), where rhetoric is ironically defined as a counterpart to cookery in the soul. Since, in this passage, Plato uses the word ‘antistrophos’ to designate an analogy, it is likely that Aristotle wants to express a kind of analogy too: what dialectic is for the (private or academic) practice of attacking and maintaining an argument, rhetoric is for the (public) practice of defending oneself or accusing an opponent. The analogy to dialectic has important implications for the status of rhetoric. Plato argued in his Gorgias that rhetoric cannot be an art (technê), since it is not related to a definite subject, while real arts are defined by their specific subjects, as e.g. medicine or shoemaking are defined by their products, i.e., health and shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp (2010). Aristotle's Rhetoric. Retrieved from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval philosophy ===
Logic, which could be considered to include dialectic, was one of the three liberal arts taught in [[medieval universities]] as part of the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]; the other elements were [[rhetoric]] and [[grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, P. (1965). The seven liberal arts; a study in mediæval culture. New York: Russell &amp; Russell. Page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, A., &amp; Walsh, J. J. (1983).

Based mainly on [[Aristotle]], the first medieval philosopher to work on dialectics was [[Boethius]] (480–524).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dA0YGAD1cQcC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=dialectics+in+Boethius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_HccRhfdjX&amp;sig=-lqZuRDK4jXLpWiN8-X8Rn36F3o&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=KGv0S_L6J4P-8AaZs-zNDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=dialectics%20in%20Boethius&amp;f=false From topic to tale: logic and narrativity in the Middle Ages], by Eugene Vance,p.43-45&lt;/ref&gt; After him, many scholastic philosophers also made use of dialectics in their works, such as [[Abelard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01036b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Peter Abelard |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Sherwood]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f3uMdwDVvL8C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Dialectic+in+william+of+sherwood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DgQ7rzGOrB&amp;sig=7KAHsosojbyBiA_Fe6KckbL_zlM&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=FGX0S8rTAYL68Aar5oijBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dialectical&amp;f=false William of Sherwood's Introduction to logic], by Norman Kretzmann,p.69-102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garlandus Compotista]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7mcPcSuUa8EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA198&amp;lpg=RA1-PA198&amp;dq=Garlandus+Compotista+and+Dialectic+in+the+Eleventh+and+Twelfth+Centuries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XkXFFyOASE&amp;sig=bH4YzmizXsgyd2LWo-QjTT5FB4o&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=F2b0S8eiB8H-8AbhrMCyAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Garlandus%20Compotista%20and%20Dialectic%20in%20the%20Eleventh%20and%20Twelfth%20Centuries&amp;f=false A History of Twelfth-Century Western Philosophy], by Peter Dronke,p.198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burley]], Roger Swyneshed, [[William of Ockham]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UnW7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=William+of+Ockham+dialectical+materialism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GRVgP3JXdO&amp;sig=KWQjQf8z5s0VMgVf5sqjIkWZgpk&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=Mmn0S4bqHMT38AablKj6Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20of%20Ockham%20dialectical%20materialism&amp;f=false Medieval literary politics: shapes of ideology], by Sheila Delany,p.11&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14663b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Thomas Aquinas |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dialectic (a ''quaestio disputata'') was formed as follows:
# The question to be determined (“It is asked whether...”);
# A provisory answer to the question (“And it seems that...”);
# The principal arguments in favor of the provisory answer;
# An argument against the provisory answer, traditionally a single argument from authority ("On the contrary...");
# The determination of the question after weighing the evidence ("I answer that...");
# The replies to each of the initial objections. (“To the first, to the second etc., I answer that...”)

=== Modern philosophy ===
The concept of dialectics was given new life by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (following [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), whose dialectically synthetic model of nature and of history made it, as it were, a fundamental aspect of the nature of reality (instead of regarding the contradictions into which dialectics leads as a sign of the sterility of the dialectical method, as [[Immanuel Kant]] tended to do in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, J. A. (1950). Philosophy of religion. New York: Ronald Press Co. Page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I., Guyer, P., &amp; Wood, A. W. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7bRychF0y0EC Critique of pure reason]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Page 495.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, the concept of "dialectic" was appropriated by [[Karl Marx]] (see, for example, ''[[Das Kapital]]'', published in 1867) and [[Friedrich Engels]] and retooled in a dynamic, nonidealistic manner. It would also become a crucial part of later representations of Marxism as a philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]]. These representations often contrasted dramatically&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Lefebvre]]'s "humanist" dialectical materialism (''Dialectical Materialism'' [1940]) was composed to directly challenge [[Joseph Stalin]]'s own dogmatic text on dialectical materialism.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to vigorous debate among different Marxist groupings, leading some prominent Marxists to give up on the idea of dialectics completely.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the work of Louis Althusser in France and Galvano Della Volpe in Italy in the mid-20th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hegelian dialectic'''&lt;!-- Boldface per WP:R#PLA. --&gt;, usually presented in a threefold manner, was stated by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Historische Entwicklung der spekulativen Philosophie von Kant bis Hegel'', Dresden-Leipzig (1837), p. 367 of the fourth edition (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; as comprising three dialectical stages of development: a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]], giving rise to its reaction; an [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]], which contradicts or negates the thesis; and the tension between the two being resolved by means of a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]. In more simplistic terms, one can consider it thus: problem → reaction → solution.  Although this model is often named after Hegel, he himself never used that specific formulation. Hegel ascribed that terminology to Kant.&lt;ref&gt;''The Accessible Hegel'' by Michael Allen Fox. Prometheus Books. 2005. p. 43. Also see Hegel's preface to the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', trans. A. V. Miller (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977), secs. 50, 51, pp. 29. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying on Kant's work, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] greatly elaborated on the synthesis model and popularized it.

On the other hand, Hegel did use a three-valued logical model that is very similar to the antithesis model, but Hegel's most usual terms were: Abstract-Negative-Concrete. Hegel used this writing model as a backbone to accompany his points in many of his works.

The formula, thesis-antithesis-synthesis, does not explain why the thesis requires an antithesis. However, the formula, abstract-negative-concrete, suggests a flaw, or perhaps an incompleteness, in any initial thesis—it is too abstract and lacks the negative of trial, error, and experience. For Hegel, the concrete, the synthesis, the absolute, must always pass through the phase of the negative, in the journey to completion, that is, mediation. This is the essence of what is popularly called Hegelian dialectics.

According to the German philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Fichte introduced into German philosophy the three-step of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, using these three terms. Schelling took up this terminology. ''Hegel did not.'' He never once used these three terms together to designate three stages in an argument or account in any of his books. And they do not help us understand his ''Phenomenology'', his ''Logic'', or his philosophy of history; they impede any open-minded comprehension of what he does by forcing it into a scheme which was available to him and which he deliberately spurned [...] The mechanical formalism [...] Hegel derides expressly and at some length in the preface to the ''Phenomenology''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel: A Reinterpretation, 1966, Anchor Books, p.154)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Mueller (June 1958), "The Hegel Legend of 'Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis", 166ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kaufmann also cites Hegel's criticism of the triad model commonly misattributed to him, adding that "the only place where Hegel uses the three terms together occurs in his lectures on the history of philosophy, on the last page but one of the section on Kant—where Hegel roundly reproaches Kant for having 'everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis'".&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Werke'', ed. Glockner, XIX, 610&lt;/ref&gt;

To describe the activity of overcoming the negative, Hegel also often used the term [[Aufheben|''Aufhebung'']], variously translated into English as "sublation" or "overcoming," to conceive of the working of the dialectic. Roughly, the term indicates preserving the useful portion of an idea, thing, society, etc., while moving beyond its limitations. ([[Jacques Derrida]]'s preferred French translation of the term was ''relever''.)&lt;ref&gt;See 'La différance' in: ''Margins of Philosophy''. Alan Bass, translator. University of Chicago Books. 1982. p. 19, fn 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Science of Logic|''Logic'']], for instance, Hegel describes a dialectic of [[existence]]: first, existence must be posited as pure Being (''Sein''); but pure Being, upon examination, is found to be indistinguishable from Nothing (''Nichts''). When it is realized that what is coming into being is, at the same time, also returning to nothing (in life, for example, one's living is also a dying), both Being and Nothing are united as Becoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hegel |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlbeing.htm#HL1_82 |title=Section in question from Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the Socratic dialectic, Hegel claimed to proceed by making implicit contradictions explicit: each stage of the process is the product of contradictions inherent or implicit in the preceding stage. For Hegel, the whole of history is one tremendous dialectic, major stages of which chart a progression from self-alienation as [[Master-slave dialectic|slavery]] to self-unification and realization as the [[Rationality|rational]] [[constitutional state]] of free and equal citizens. The Hegelian dialectic cannot be mechanically applied for any chosen thesis. Critics argue that the selection of any antithesis, other than the logical negation of the thesis, is subjective. Then, if the logical negation is used as the antithesis, there is no rigorous way to derive a synthesis. In practice, when an antithesis is selected to suit the user's subjective purpose, the resulting "contradictions" are [[rhetoric]]al, not logical, and the resulting synthesis is not rigorously defensible against a multitude of other possible syntheses. The problem with the Fichtean "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" model is that it implies that contradictions or negations come from outside of things. Hegel's point is that they are inherent in and internal to things. This conception of dialectics derives ultimately from [[Heraclitus]].

Hegel stated that the purpose of dialectics is "to study things in their own being and movement and thus to demonstrate the finitude of the partial categories of understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. ''The Logic''. ''Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences''. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. Note to §81&lt;/ref&gt;

One important dialectical principle for Hegel is the transition from quantity to quality, which he terms the Measure. The measure is the qualitative quantum, the quantum is the existence of quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §§107–111&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The identity between quantity and quality, which is found in Measure, is at first only implicit, and not yet explicitly realised. In other words, these two categories, which unite in Measure, each claim an independent authority. On the one hand, the quantitative features of existence may be altered, without affecting its quality. On the other hand, this increase and diminution, immaterial though it be, has its limit, by exceeding which the quality suffers change. [...] But if the quantity present in measure exceeds a certain limit, the quality corresponding to it is also put in abeyance. This however is not a negation of quality altogether, but only of this definite quality, the place of which is at once occupied by another. This process of measure, which appears alternately as a mere change in quantity, and then as a sudden revulsion of quantity into quality, may be envisaged under the figure of a nodal (knotted) line.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §§108–109&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example, Hegel mentions the states of aggregation of water: "Thus the temperature of water is, in the first place, a point of no consequence in respect of its liquidity: still with the increase or diminution of the temperature of the liquid water, there comes a point where this state of cohesion suffers a qualitative change, and the water is converted into steam or ice".&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §108&lt;/ref&gt; As other examples Hegel mentions the reaching of a point where a single additional grain makes a heap of wheat; or where the bald tail is produced, if we continue plucking out single hairs.

Another important principle for Hegel is the negation of the negation, which he also terms ''Aufhebung'' (sublation): Something is only what it is in its relation to another, but by the negation of the negation this something incorporates the other into itself. The dialectical movement involves two moments that negate each other, something and its other. As a result of the negation of the negation, "something becomes its other; this other is itself something; therefore it likewise becomes an other, and so on ad infinitum".&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §93&lt;/ref&gt; Something in its passage into other only joins with itself, it is self-related.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §95&lt;/ref&gt; In becoming there are two moments:&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1812. Hegel's Science of Logic. London. Allen &amp; Unwin. §§176–179.&lt;/ref&gt; coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be: by sublation, i.e., negation of the negation, being passes over into nothing, it ceases to be, but something new shows up, is coming to be. What is sublated (''aufgehoben'') on the one hand ceases to be and is put to an end, but on the other hand it is preserved and maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1812. Hegel's Science of Logic. London. Allen &amp; Unwin. §185.&lt;/ref&gt; In dialectics, a totality transforms itself; it is self-related, then self-forgetful, relieving the original tension.

==== Marxist dialectic ====&lt;!-- 'Marxist dialectic' redirects here. --&gt;
{{Marxism}}
{{Frankfurt School}}
Marxist dialectic is a form of Hegelian dialectic which applies to the study of [[historical materialism]]. It purports to be a reflection of the real world created by man. Dialectic would thus be a robust method under which one could examine personal, social, and economic behaviors. Marxist dialectic is the core foundation of the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]], which forms the basis of the ideas behind historical materialism.

[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] proposed that Hegel's dialectic is too abstract: {{quote|The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands, by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1873) ''Capital'' Afterword to the Second German Edition, Vol. I [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contradiction to Hegelian idealism, Marx presented his own dialectic method, which he claims to be "direct opposite" of Hegel's method: {{quote|My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e. the process of thinking, which, under the name of 'the Idea', he even transforms into an independent subject, is the [[Demiurge|demiurgos]] of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of 'the Idea'. With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|title=Afterword (Second German Ed.)|journal=Capital|volume=1|page=14|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/doc/Capital-Volume-I.doc|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In Marxism, the dialectical method of historical study became intertwined with [[historical materialism]], the school of thought exemplified by the works of Marx, Engels, and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In the USSR, under [[Joseph Stalin]], Marxist dialectics became "diamat" (short for dialectical materialism), a theory emphasizing the primacy of the material way of life; social "praxis" over all forms of social consciousness; and the secondary, dependent character of the "ideal". The term "dialectical materialism" was coined by the 19th-century social theorist [[Joseph Dietzgen]] who used the theory to explain the nature of [[socialism]] and social development. The original populariser of Marxism in Russia, [[Georgi Plekhanov]] used the terms "dialectical materialism" and "historical materialism" interchangeably. For Lenin, the primary feature of Marx's "dialectical materialism" (Lenin's term) was its application of materialist philosophy to history and social sciences. Lenin's main input in the philosophy of dialectical materialism was his theory of reflection, which presented human consciousness as a dynamic reflection of the objective material world that fully shapes its contents and structure. Later, Stalin's works on the subject established a rigid and formalistic division of Marxist–Leninist theory in the dialectical materialism and historical materialism parts. While the first was supposed to be the key method and theory of the philosophy of nature, the second was the Soviet version of the philosophy of history.

A dialectical method was fundamental to Marxist politics, e.g., the works of [[Karl Korsch]], [[Georg Lukács]] and certain members of the [[Frankfurt School]]. Soviet academics, notably [[Evald Ilyenkov]] and [[Zaid Orudzhev]], continued pursuing unorthodox philosophic study of Marxist dialectics; likewise in the West, notably the philosopher [[Bertell Ollman]] at  [[New York University]].

Friedrich Engels proposed that Nature is dialectical, thus, in [[Anti-Dühring]] he said that the negation of negation is: {{quote|A very simple process, which is taking place everywhere and every day, which any child can understand as soon as it is stripped of the veil of mystery in which it was enveloped by the old [[Idealism|idealist]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Frederick, (1877) ''Anti-Dühring,''Part I: Philosophy, XIII. Dialectics. Negation of the Negation. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch11.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'', Engels said: {{quote|Probably the same gentlemen who up to now have decried the transformation of quantity into quality as [[mysticism]] and incomprehensible [[transcendentalism]] will now declare that it is indeed something quite self-evident, trivial, and commonplace, which they have long employed, and so they have been taught nothing new. But to have formulated for the first time in its universally valid form a general law of development of Nature, society, and thought, will always remain an act of historic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch02.htm |title=Engels, Frederick, (1883) ''Dialectics of Nature:''II. Dialectics |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marxist dialectics is exemplified in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (Capital), which outlines two central theories: (i) surplus value and (ii) the materialist conception of history; Marx explains dialectical materialism: {{quote|In its rational form, it is a scandal and abomination to [[bourgeoisie|bourgeoisdom]] and its doctrinaire professors, because it includes in its comprehension an affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time, also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, (1873) ''Capital'' Vol. I, Afterword to the Second German Edition.
[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Class struggle]] is the primary contradiction to be resolved by Marxist dialectics, because of its central role in the social and political lives of a society. Nonetheless, Marx and Marxists developed the concept of class struggle to comprehend the dialectical contradictions between mental and manual labor, and between town and country. Hence, philosophic contradiction is central to the development of dialectics{{snd}} the progress from quantity to quality, the acceleration of gradual social change; the negation of the initial development of the ''status quo''; the negation of that negation; and the high-level recurrence of features of the original ''status quo''. In the USSR, Progress Publishers issued anthologies of dialectical materialism by Lenin, wherein he also quotes Marx and Engels: {{quote|As the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development, and the richest in content, Hegelian dialectics was considered by Marx and Engels the greatest achievement of classical German philosophy.... "The great basic thought", Engels writes, "that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things, apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away... this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that, in its generality, it is now scarcely ever contradicted.

But, to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words, and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation, are two different things.... For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it, except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy, itself, is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain." Thus, according to Marx, dialectics is "the science of the general laws of motion both of the external world and of human thought".&lt;ref name="Lenin, V.I. page 7-9"&gt;Lenin, V. I., ''On the Question of Dialectics: A Collection'', pp. 7–9. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lenin describes his dialectical understanding of the concept of ''development'': {{quote|A development that repeats, as it were, stages that have already been passed, but repeats them in a different way, on a higher basis ("the negation of the negation"), a development, so to speak, that proceeds in spirals, not in a straight line; a development by leaps, catastrophes, and revolutions; "breaks in continuity"; the transformation of quantity into quality; inner impulses towards development, imparted by the contradiction and conflict of the various forces and tendencies acting on a given body, or within a given phenomenon, or within a given society; the interdependence and the closest and indissoluble connection between all aspects of any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows definite laws{{snd}} these are some of the features of dialectics as a doctrine of development that is richer than the conventional one.&lt;ref name="Lenin, V.I. page 7-9"/&gt;}}

==== Dialectical naturalism ====
[[Dialectical naturalism]] is a term coined by American philosopher [[Murray Bookchin]] to describe the philosophical underpinnings of the political program of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]]. Dialectical naturalism explores the complex interrelationship between social problems, and the direct consequences they have on the ecological impact of human society. Bookchin offered dialectical naturalism as a contrast to what he saw as the "empyrean, basically antinaturalistic dialectical idealism" of Hegel, and "the wooden, often scientistic dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxists".

== Dialectical theology ==
[[Neo-orthodoxy]], in Europe also known as theology of crisis and dialectical theology,&lt;ref name=BR1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/topic-409012/neoorthodoxy|title=Original Britinnica online|accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BR2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409012/neoorthodoxy#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=neoorthodoxy%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Britannica Encyclopedia (online) |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach to [[theology]] in [[Protestantism]] that was developed in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] (1914–1918). It is characterized as a reaction against doctrines of [[Christianity in the 19th century|19th-century]] [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and a more positive reevaluation of the teachings of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], much of which had been in decline (especially in western Europe) since the late [[Christianity in the 18th century|18th century]].&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neo-orthodox |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary(online) |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily associated with two [[Swiss people|Swiss]] professors and pastors, [[Karl Barth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/91/N0059100.html |title=American Heritage Dictionary (online) |accessdate=2008-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510080135/http://bartleby.com/61/91/N0059100.html |archive-date=2005-05-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1886–1968) and [[Emil Brunner]] (1899–1966),&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BR2/&gt; even though Barth himself expressed his unease in the use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;See Church Dogmatics III/3, xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In dialectical theology the difference and opposition between God and human beings is stressed in such a way that all human attempts at overcoming this opposition through moral, religious or philosophical idealism must be characterized as 'sin'. In the death of Christ humanity is negated and overcome, but this judgment also points forwards to the resurrection in which humanity is reestablished in Christ. For Barth this meant that only through God's 'no' to everything human can his 'yes' be perceived. Applied to traditional themes of Protestant theology, such as [[double predestination]], this means that election and reprobation cannot be viewed as a quantitative limitation of God's action. Rather it must be seen as its "qualitative definition".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Barth, The Epistle to the Romans (1933), p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; As Christ bore the rejection as well as the election of God for all humanity, every person is subject to both aspects of God's double predestination.

== Legacy ==
Dialectics has become central to continental philosophy, but it plays no part in Anglo-American philosophy. In other words, on the continent of Europe, dialectics has entered intellectual culture as what might be called a legitimate part of thought and philosophy, whereas in America and Britain, the dialectic plays no discernible part in the intellectual culture, which instead tends toward [[positivism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A prime example of the European tradition is [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', which is very different from the works of Popper, whose philosophy was for a time highly influential in the UK where he resided (see below). Sartre states:
:[[Existentialism]], like [[Marxism]], addresses itself to experience in order to discover there concrete syntheses. It can conceive of these syntheses only within a moving, dialectical totalisation, which is nothing else but history or—from the strictly cultural point of view adopted here—'philosophy-becoming-the world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/critic/sartre1.htm |title=The Search for Method (1st part) Sartre, 1960, in Existentialism from Dostoyevsky to Sartre, transl. Hazel Barnes, Vintage Books |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
[[Karl Popper]] has attacked the dialectic repeatedly. In 1937, he wrote and delivered a paper entitled "What Is Dialectic?" in which he attacked the dialectical method for its willingness "to put up with contradictions".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper,''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' [New York: Basic Books, 1962], p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper concluded the essay with these words: "The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that [[philosophy]] should not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical [[Scientific method|methods of science]]" (Ibid., p.&amp;nbsp;335).

In chapter 12 of volume 2 of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1944; 5th rev. ed., 1966), Popper unleashed a famous attack on Hegelian dialectics in which he held that Hegel's thought (unjustly in the view of some philosophers, such as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walter Kaufmann |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm |title=kaufmann |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to some degree responsible for facilitating the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe by encouraging and justifying [[Epistemology#Irrationalism|irrationalism]]. In section 17 of his 1961 "addenda" to ''The Open Society'', entitled "Facts, Standards and Truth: A Further Criticism of Relativism", Popper refused to moderate his criticism of the Hegelian dialectic, arguing that it "played a major role in the downfall of [[Weimar Republic|the liberal movement in Germany]] [...] by contributing to [[historicism]] and to an identification of might and right, encouraged [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] modes of thought. [...] [And] undermined and eventually lowered the traditional standards of intellectual responsibility and honesty".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper,''The Open Society and Its Enemies'', 5th rev. ed., vol. 2 [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966], p.&amp;nbsp;395&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of science and physicist [[Mario Bunge]] repeatedly criticized Hegelian and Marxian dialectics, calling them "fuzzy and remote from science"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bunge |first=Mario Augusto |authorlink=Mario Bunge |date=1981 |chapter=A critique of dialectics |title=Scientific materialism |series=Episteme |volume=9 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |pages=41–63 |isbn=9027713049 |oclc=7596139 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-8517-9_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "disastrous legacy".&lt;ref name="Bunge 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bunge |first=Mario Augusto |authorlink=Mario Bunge |date=2012 |title=Evaluating philosophies |series=Boston studies in the philosophy of science |volume=295 |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=84–85 |isbn=9789400744073 |oclc=806947226 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-4408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded: "The so-called laws of dialectics, such as formulated by Engels (1940, 1954) and Lenin (1947, 1981), are false insofar as they are intelligible."&lt;ref name="Bunge 2012"/&gt;

== Formalism ==
{{main|Logic and dialectic}}
In the past few decades, European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for dialectical logic or [[argument (logic)|argument]].&lt;ref name="Eemeren"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eemeren |first1=Frans H. van |last2=Garssen |first2=Bart |last3=Krabbe |first3=Erik C.

Pollock]]), systems have been built that define well-formedness of arguments, rules governing the process of introducing arguments based on fixed assumptions, and rules for shifting burden. Many of these logics appear in the special area of [[artificial intelligence and law]], though the computer scientists' interest in formalizing dialectic originates in a desire to build [[decision support]] and computer-supported collaborative work systems.&lt;ref&gt;For surveys of work in this area see, for example: {{cite journal |last1=Chesñevar |first1=Carlos Iván |last2=Maguitman |first2=Ana Gabriela |last3=Loui |first3=Ronald Prescott |date=December 2000 |title=Logical models of argument |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=337–383 |doi=10.1145/371578.371581|url=http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~loui/survey.ps.gz }} And: {{cite book |last1=Prakken |first1=Henry |last2=Vreeswijk |first2=Gerard |date=2005 |chapter=Logics for defeasible argumentation |editor1-last=Gabbay |editor1-first=Dov M. |editor2-last=Guenthner |editor2-first=Franz |title=Handbook of philosophical logic |edition=2nd |volume=4 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |isbn=9789048158775 |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0456-4_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flavius Dioscorus''' ({{lang-el|Φλαύϊος Διόσκορος}} ''Flauios Dioskoros'') lived during the 6th century A.D. in the village of [[Per-Wadjet (Upper Egypt)|Aphrodito]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], and therefore is called by modern scholars '''Dioscorus of Aphrodito'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was an Egyptian, he composed poetry in [[Byzantine literature|Greek]], the cultural language of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems are the oldest surviving poems written by the hand of a known poet.&lt;ref&gt;Parca 1991, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts, which contain his corrections and revisions, were discovered on [[papyrus]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1911, pp. 454–456.&lt;/ref&gt; and are now held in museums and libraries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1984a, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus was also occupied in [[Roman law|legal work]], and legal documents and drafts involving him, his family, Aphroditans, and others were discovered along with his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 4; [[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]]-Magdelaine 2008, pp. 310–343.&lt;/ref&gt; As an administrator of the village of Aphrodito, he composed petitions on behalf of its citizens, which are unique for their poetic and religious qualities.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 16–19 and ff.; Kovelman 1991, pp. 138–148; Kuehn 1995, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus was a Christian (a [[Copts|Copt]]) and lived in a [[Coptic monasticism|religiously active environment]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 5–7; Kuehn 1995, pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Greek and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] papyri associated with Dioscorus and Aphrodito is one of the most important finds in the history of [[papyrology]] and has shed considerable light on the law and society of Byzantine Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Bell-Crum 1925, p. 177; Kuehn 1995, p. 47; Ruffini 2008, pp. 150–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
The papyri of Dioscorus were discovered by accident in July 1905 in the village of Kom Ashkaw (also called Kom Ishgau, Kom Ishqaw, etc.), which was built above the ancient site of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre 1907, pp. viii–xi.&lt;/ref&gt; An inhabitant was renovating his home when a wall collapsed and revealed a chasm below. Papyrus rolls and fragments were seen in the crevice, but by the time the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Antiquities Service]] was notified and arrived, most of the papyrus was gone. During subsequent excavations, a large jar filled with papyrus was discovered in a Roman-style house. Important fragments of [[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian Comedy]], both Old and New, were discovered among these papyri, including fragments of the famous comedy writer [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre 1907, 1911; Gomme-Sandbach 1973; Koenen 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also fragments of Homer's [[Iliad]] and other literary works and reference works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]] 1999, pp. 9–237; Fournet-Magdelaine 2008, pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jean Maspero.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Maspero]], editor of the first collection of Dioscorian poems (1911)]]

Most importantly, the excavator Gustave Lefebvre unearthed an archive of sixth-century legal, business, and personal papers, and original poetry. These were turned over to the young scholar Jean Maspero, son of the Director of the Antiquities Service of Egypt, who edited and published the documents and poems in several journal articles &lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1908–1910, 1910, 1911, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; and two volumes of the ''Catalogue général des antiquités égyptiennes du Musée du Caire: Papyrus grecs d’époque byzantine'' (Cairo 1911, 1913). Jean was killed in the battle at Vauquois on the Lorraine during [[World War I]], and his father Gaston completed the third volume of Dioscorian papyri in 1916. Other Dioscorian papyri, obtained by antiquities dealers through sales and clandestine excavations,&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Maspero, intro. to P.Cair.Masp. III, p. viii; Keenan 1984a, pp. 52–53, and 2009, p. 66; Gagos-van Minnen 1994, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; were published in Florence, London, Paris, Strasbourg, Princeton, [[University of Michigan Papyrus Collection|Ann Arbor]], the Vatican, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See note 5 above.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aphrodito ==
The village of Kom Ashkaw is in [[Geography of Egypt|Middle Egypt]], south of Cairo and north of Luxor. It was originally an Egyptian city, but after [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt in 332 B.C., it was given the Greek name "Aphroditopolis" (“The City of [[Aphrodite]]”) and was made the capital city of its ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]'' (an administrative district, like a US county). Before the 6th century, however, [[Aphroditopolis Nome|Aphroditopolis]] lost its status as a city, and the capital of the ''nome'' was moved across the Nile River to [[Antaeopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 6; Kuehn 1995, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Aphrodito and the city of Antaeopolis were part of a larger, merged administrative district called the [[Thebaid]], which was under the jurisdiction of a ''[[dux|doux]]'', appointed by the [[Byzantine Emperor]]. The ''doux'' had his administrative center in [[Antinopolis|Antinoopolis]] on the east bank of the [[Nile|Nile River]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall-Rathbone 2004, pp. 169–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aphrodito was situated in an environment that was highly poetic and religious. [[Nonnus]], the most influential poet of the Early Byzantine Era (A.D. 300–700), had come from Panopolis, 42&amp;nbsp;km. southeast of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron 2007; pp. 34–39; Cavero 2008, pp. 15–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets from the Thebaid had not only become celebrities—such as [[Musaeus Grammaticus]], Colluthus, and Christodorus—but also were part of a poetic revolution of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron 1965 passim; MacCoull 1988, pp. 59–61; Cavero 2008, pp. 25–105.&lt;/ref&gt; These poets, though Egyptians, wrote their verses in the Greek dialect of [[Homer]], who had composed his Iliad and Odyssey more than a thousand years before them. Perhaps one of the reasons for this movement was to usurp the pagan vocabulary and style of the most honored ancient poet for Christian purposes. Dioscorus continued and developed this revolution by writing [[Encomium|encomiastic poems]] (poems of praise) in an Homeric style.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1985, p. 9; Fournet 1999, pp. 673–675.&lt;/ref&gt; The community was also active religiously. According to the New Testament, Egypt was the first home of [[Flight into Egypt|young Jesus and his family]].&lt;ref&gt;Mt 2:13–21.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to [[Church Fathers|Patristic literature]], Egypt was the birthplace of [[Christian monasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Athanasius, Life of Antony.&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Egypt, the areas of [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], [[Kellia]], and [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] contained large monastic centers that attracted devout followers from both the Eastern and Western halves of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall-Rathbone 2004, pp. 107–115.&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Egypt, one of the first Christian monasteries was established at [[Pachomius|Pbow]], 127&amp;nbsp;km. southeast of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Gascou 1976, pp. 157–184; Rousseau 1985 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 40&amp;nbsp;km. south of Aphrodito was the [[White Monastery]], founded by the vigorous Coptic monk [[Shenoute]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmel 2004 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; The father of Dioscorus himself, Apollos, established and later entered his own monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Gascou 1981, pp. 219–230.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Aphrodito and its vicinity “boasted over thirty churches and nearly forty monasteries.”&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early years===
There is no surviving record for the early years of Dioscorus. His father Apollos was an entrepreneur and local official.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1984b passim; Kuehn 1995, pp. 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly accepted date for the birth of Dioscorus is around A.D. 520.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1911, p. 457; MacCoull 1988, p. 9; Kuehn 1995, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no evidence, it is likely that Dioscorus went to school in [[Alexandria]], where one of his teachers might have been the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[John Philoponus]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1987 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Alexandria was not the most prominent place for a legal education – that was the city of [[Beirut]] – young men did travel there for rhetorical training preliminary to the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Cribiore 2007, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; These included the celebrated poet [[Agathias]], a contemporary of Dioscorus, who at an early age published a successful collection of poems called the Cycle and later became the center of a circle of prominent poets in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan and Averil Cameron 1966, pp. 8–10; Averil Cameron 1970 1–11, 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Aphrodito, Dioscorus married, had children, and pursued a career similar to his father's: acquiring, leasing out, and managing property, and helping in the administration of the village.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1988, p. 173; Kuehn 1995, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; His first dated appearance in the papyrus is 543. Dioscorus had the assistant of the ''[[defensor civitatis]]'' of Antaeopolis examine the damage done by a shepherd and his flock to a field of crops, which was owned by the Monastery of Apa Sourous but managed by Dioscorus.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67087; Keenan 1985, pp. 245–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constantinople===
[[Image:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Empress Theodora.'' Mosaic. San Vitale, Ravenna.&lt;br /&gt;6th century representation of the Empress Theodora.]]

Dioscorus also became engaged in legal work. In 546/7, after his father Apollos died, Dioscorus wrote a formal petition to [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] and a formal explanation to [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Empress Theodora]] about tax conflicts affecting Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67019 v, and P.Cair.Masp. III 67283.&lt;/ref&gt; The village was under the special patronage of the Empress,&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, intro. to P.Cair.Masp. III 67283, pp. 15–17; Bell 1944, p. 31; Keenan 1984a, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been granted the status of ''autopragia''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, p. 53 note 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the village could collect its own public taxes and deliver them directly to the imperial treasury. Aphrodito was not under the jurisdiction of the [[pagarch]], stationed in Antaeopolis, who handled the public taxes for the rest of the ''nome''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Gascou|Gascou]] 1972, pp. 60–72; Liebeschuetz 1973, pp. 38–46, and 1974, pp. 163–168.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus's petition and explanation to the imperial palace described the pagarch's violations of their special tax status, including theft of the collected tax money.

The communications to Constantinople seem to have had little effect, and in 551 (three years after the death of Theodora), Dioscorus travelled with a contingency of Aphroditans to Constantinople to present the problem to the Emperor directly. Dioscorus may have spent three years in the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Salomon 1948, pp. 98 – 108; Fournet 1999, pp. 318 – 321.&lt;/ref&gt; In poetry, the city was very active. Not only was [[Agathias]] now writing there, but also [[Paul the Silentiary]] and [[Romanus the Melodist]]. In respect to the Aphroditans' tax problems, Dioscorus was able to obtain an imperial rescript, three copies of which have survived in his archive.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67024 r, v, and 67025.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor instructs the Duke of the Thebaid to investigate and, if justified, to stop the aggressions of the pagarch. There is no evidence of further tax violations by the pagarch until after the death of Justinian in 565.

===Antinoopolis===

[[Image:Petersinai.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''St. Peter.'' Encaustic icon. Sinai.&lt;br /&gt;6th century representation of St. Peter as a Roman consul.]]

In 565/6 Dioscorus left Aphrodito for Antinoopolis, the capital city of the Thebaid and the residence of the ''doux''.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 11–12; Kuehn 1995, p. 66.
&lt;/ref&gt; He remained there for about seven years. His motivation for the move is nowhere made clear. But surmising from the surviving documents, one can conclude that he was attracted by the opportunity to advance his legal career in the proximity of the Duke and likewise was compelled by the increasing violence of the pagarch against Aphrodito and his own family.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal documents from that period show that Dioscorus wrote the final will for the Surgeon General (Phoebammon),&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. II 67151 and 67152.&lt;/ref&gt; arbitrated in family property disputes,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.Lond. V 1708.&lt;/ref&gt; composed marriage and divorce contracts,&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1993, pp. 103–106, and 1995, p. 70 note 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued writing petitions about the offenses of the pagarch. One such petition, P.Cair.Masp. I 67002, describes how a group of Aphroditans on their way to the annual cattle market were ambushed. They were eventually put into a prison in Antaeopolis, under the control of the pagarch Menas, where they were tortured and robbed and their animals were seized. Menas and his men then attacked the village of Aphrodito itself: he blocked the [[Bahr Yussef|irrigation]], extorted money, burned down homes, and violated the nuns. All these crimes were committed in the name of collecting the public taxes, although Aphrodito had never failed a payment and Menas had no right to collect them. A formal explanation, P.Lond. V 1677, describes the attacks by Menas on Dioscorus himself and his family. He seized property owned by Dioscorus and transferred it to his assistants, leaving Dioscorus with only the tax liability. Menas proceeded to pillage the home of Dioscorus's brother-in-law and seized his land too, reducing him and his family to poverty. He then arrested Dioscorus's own son.

Before May 574, Dioscorus left Antinoopolis.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 14; Kuehn 1995, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for his departure is not explained. It might have been related to domestic affairs, to his career, or to the changed situation in Constantinople. The violent crimes against Aphrodito and Dioscorus (described above) were committed under the reign of [[Justin II]], who had launched a savage persecution of Christians that did not adhere to [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]] dogmas, including [[Monophysitism|Egyptian Copts]]. But Justin went completely insane and abdicated, and in 574, [[Tiberius II Constantine|Tiberius]] and Empress [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]], the wife of Justin, took over the management of the Byzantine Empire.

=== Return to Aphrodito ===

Back home in Aphrodito, it seems that Dioscorus withdrew from legal affairs and administrative responsibilities. Much of his poetry was composed during his stay in Antinoopolis or after he had returned to Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 13–14; Kuehn 1995, pp. 73, 75–76; Fournet 1999, pp. 321–324.&lt;/ref&gt; His documents now focus on mundane, rural activities. His last dated document, a land lease written by his hand in an account book, is April 5, 585.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. III 67325 IV r 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==

===Publications===
Dioscorus might have recited his poems and circulated them locally, but there is no evidence that they were ever published during his lifetime. Jean Maspero published the first collection of Dioscorian poems in 1911: “Un dernier poète grec d’Égypte: Dioscore, fils d’Apollôs.”&lt;ref&gt;Revue des études grecques 24: 426–81.&lt;/ref&gt; This journal article included the texts of 13 poems, French translations, and an analysis of the style. Then between 1911 and 1916, Jean and Gaston Maspero republished the poems along with Dioscorian documents in three volumes of ''Papyrus grecs d'époque byzantine''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue général des antiquités égyptiennes du Musée du Caire: Papyrus grecs d’époque byzantine, 3 vols. (Cairo, 1911–1916). [P.Cair.Masp. I–III]&lt;/ref&gt; These poems were all part of the papyrus collection owned by the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. In 1962, Ernst Heitsch published 29 Dioscorian poems that were among papyrus fragments held in a variety of museums and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Die griechischen Dichterfragmente der römischen Kaiserzeit, Vol. 1, 2nd edn. (Göttingen, 1963); Vol. 2 (Göttingen, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; For over thirty-five years, this was the authoritative edition. The most comprehensive edition at the present time is by [[Jean-Luc Fournet]], who in 1999 published 51 Dioscorian poems and fragments (including 2 that he considered of dubious authenticity).&lt;ref&gt;Hellénisme dans l’Égypte du VIe siècle. La bibliothèque et l’œuvre de Dioscore d’Aphrodité [MIFAO 115], 2 vols. (Cairo 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the texts and commentaries offered by Maspero, Heitsch, [[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]], and the initial editors of other poems, a comprehensive study of his poetry was published by Leslie MacCoull in 1988: ''Dioscorus of Aphrodito: His Work and His World'' (Berkeley). Clement Kuehn published a reinterpretation of his poetry in 1995: ''Channels of Imperishable Fire: The Beginnings of Christian Mystical Poetry and Dioscorus of Aphrodito'' (New York).

===Interpretations===
The reactions by modern readers to his poetry have varied widely. The papyrologists and historians that first examined them were not impressed. Influenced by their backgrounds in [[List of Ancient Greek poets|Classical poetry]], they compared the Dioscorian verses primarily to Classical standards. The most frequent objection was that his verses were obscure: the editors thought that the lines did not make sense – or at least, were not saying what the editors expected them to say.&lt;ref&gt;“Le style de Dioscore fait pauvre figure” (Maspero 1911, p. 472; cf. 427). “At no moment has he any real control of thought, diction, grammar, metre, or meaning” (Milne 1927, p. 68). “So ist doch selbst dort, wo der Text heil zu sein scheint, der Gedankengang nicht immer verständlich” (Heitsch 1963, p. 16 note 1).&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive assessment was offered by Leslie MacCoull, who insisted that a reader must take Dioscorus’s Coptic background into consideration when reading the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 57–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the poems seemed to be praising unknown dignitaries – including an Emperor and several Dukes – and some papyrologists concluded that Dioscorus wrote the poems to get favors from government administrators (whom the papyrologists vaguely and inconsistently identified).&lt;ref&gt;“C’est que, pour Dioscore, la poésie semble ne se concevoir que dans l’adversité : elle est destinée à obtenir, non à donner” (Fournet 1999, p. 325).&lt;/ref&gt; Clement Kuehn, however, proposed that the poems be viewed not from a Classical, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], or even a strictly [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]] perspective,&lt;ref&gt;“To be sure, most of these poems are not great works of literature, especially when compared with their illustrious classical models” (Gagos-van Minnen 1994, p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt; but through a lens of [[Byzantine literature|Byzantine culture]] and [[Christian mysticism|spirituality]], in which Dioscorus and the Thebaid were so deeply immersed. Kuehn demonstrated that the poems fit neatly and masterfully into the [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegorical style]] that was pervasive in the pictoral art and literature of the Early Byzantine Era.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann 1978, pp. 40–55; Lamberton 1986 passim; Dawson 1992 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; That is: Dioscorus, influenced by allegorical commentaries on the [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric epics]] and Bible, and by the allegorical icons and church art of the [[Byzantine art|6th century]], was praising Christ, Old Testament patriarchs, and the saints in heaven as if they were the Emperor, kings, and dignitaries in a Byzantine court.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 2, 156, and passim; Kuehn 2011, pp. 9–12 (“Introduction”).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Edgelands was introduced by [[Marion Shoard]] in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-beautiful-edgelands-a-dark-light-on-the-edge-of-town-2217071.html Our beautiful edgelands]&lt;/ref&gt;  However a century and a half earlier, [[Victor Hugo]] had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside...ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]], ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard Jeffries]] similarly explored the London edgeland in ''Nature near London'' (1883).

'''Ethnic studies''', in the United States, is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of difference—chiefly race, ethnicity, and nation, but also sexuality, gender, and other such markings—and power, as expressed by the state, by civil society, and by individuals. Ethnic studies is an academic field that spans the humanities and the social sciences, it emerged as an academic field in the second half of the 20th century partly in response to charges that traditional social science and humanities disciplines such as [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[cultural studies]], and [[area studies]] which were conceived from an inherently [[Eurocentric]] perspective. Its origin, then, lies in the civil rights era, when ethnic studies was originally conceived to re-frame the way that specific disciplines had told the stories, histories, struggles and triumphs of people of color on what was seen to be their own terms. In recent years, it has broadened its focus to include questions of representation, [[racialization]], [[racial formation theory]], and more determinedly interdisciplinary topics and approaches.

==History==
In the United States, the field of ethnic studies evolved out of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1960s and early 1970s, which contributed to growing self-awareness and radicalization of people of color such as African-Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. Ethnic studies departments were established on college campuses across the country and have grown to encompass [[African American Studies]], [[Asian American Studies]], [[La Raza|Raza]] Studies, [[Chicano Studies]], Mexican American Studies, and [[Native American Studies]], as well as Jewish-American Studies and Italian-American Studies.
 
The first strike demanding the establishment of an Ethnic Studies department occurred in 1968, led by the [[Third World Liberation Front]] (TWLF), a joint effort of the Black Student Union, Latin American Students Organization, Asian American Political Alliance, Pilipino American Collegiate Endeavor, and Native American Students Union at [[San Francisco State University]]. This was the longest student strike in the nation's history, and resulted in the establishment of a School of Ethnic Studies. President [[S. I. Hayakawa]] ended the strike after taking a hardline approach,when he appointed Dr. James Hirabayashi the first dean of the School (now College) of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/profile.php?profile=Hirabayashi, James]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased recruiting and admissions of students of color in response to the strike's demands. In 1972, The National Association for Ethnic Studies was founded to foster interdisciplinary discussions for scholars and activists concerned with the national and international dimensions of ethnicity encouraging conversations related to anthropology, Africana Studies, Native Studies, Sociology and American Studies among other fields.

Minority students at The [[University of California at Berkeley]]- united under their own Third World Liberation Front, the TWLF, initiated the second longest student strike in the history of this country on January 22, 1969. The groups involved were the Mexican American Student Confederation, Asian American Political Alliance, African American Student Union, and the Native American group. The four co-Chairmen of the TWLF were Ysidro Macias, Richard Aoki, Charlie Brown, and LaNada Means.

This strike at Berkeley was even more violent than the San Francisco State strike, in that more than five police departments, the California Highway Patrol, Alameda County Deputies, and finally, the California National Guard were ordered onto the Berkeley campus by Ronald Reagan in the effort to quash the strike. The excessive use of police force has been cited with promoting the strike by the alienation of non-striking students and faculty, who protested the continual presence of police on the Berkeley campus. The faculty union voted to join the strike on March 2, and two days later the Academic Senate called on the administration to grant an interim Department of Ethnic Studies. On March 7, 1969, President Hitch authorized the establishment of the first Ethnic Studies Department in the country, followed by the establishment of the nation's first College of Ethnic Studies at [[San Francisco State University]] on March 20, 1969. 

Courses in ethnic studies address perceptions that, because of the Eurocentric bias and racial and ethnic prejudice of those in power, American historians have systematically ignored or undervalued the roles of such ethnic minorities as Asian Americans, Blacks, Mexicans, Latinos and Native Americans.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Ethnic studies also often encompasses issues of [[intersectionality]], where gender, class, and sexuality also come into play. There are now hundreds of African American, Asian American, Mexican American and Chicano/Latino Studies departments in the US, approximately fifty Native American Studies departments, and a small number of comparative ethnic studies programs. College students, especially on the East Coast, continue to advocate for Ethnic Studies departments. The Ethnic Studies Coalition at [[Wellesley College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewellesleynews.com/2018/10/25/ethnic-studies-coalition-pushes-for-ethnic-studies-major-at-wellesley/|title=Ethnic Studies Coalition pushes for Ethnic Studies major at Wellesley {{!}} The Wellesley News|website=thewellesleynews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Taskforce for Asian and Pacific American Studies at [[Harvard University]], and CRAASH at [[Hunter College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/university-students-alumni-fight-increase-asian-american-studies-n589246|title=University Students, Alumni Fight for Growth in Asian American Studies|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; are among student organizations calling for increased institutional support for Ethnic Studies. Ethnic studies as an institutional discipline varies by location. For instance, whereas the Ethnic Studies Department at [[UC Berkeley]] comprises separate "core group" departments, the department at [[UC San Diego]] does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050319222738/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/02/09/4209bd8f7f02c]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
While early ethnic studies scholarship focused on the repressed histories and identities of various groups in the U.S., the field of study has expanded to encompass transnationalism, comparative race Studies, and postmodernist/poststructuralist critiques. While pioneering thinkers relied on frameworks, theories and methodologies such as those found in the allied fields of sociology, history, literature and film, scholars in the field today utilize multidisciplinary as well as comparative perspectives, increasingly within an international or transnational context. Central to much Ethnic Studies scholarship is understanding how race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and other categories of difference intersect to shape the lived experiences of people of color, what the legal scholar [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberle Crenshaw]] calls intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1229039|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|first=Kimberle|last=Crenshaw|date=January 1, 1991|publisher=|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–1299|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most recently, "whiteness" studies has been included as a popular site of inquiry in what is a traditionally academic field for studying the racial formation of communities of color. Instead of including whites as another additive component to ethnic studies, [[whiteness studies]] has instead focused on how the political and juridical category of white has been constructed and protected in relation to racial "others" and how it continues to shape the relationship between bodies of color and the State. As Ian Haney-Lopez articulates in ''White By Law: The Legal Construction of Race'', the law has functioned as the vehicle through which certain racialized groups have been included or excluded from the category of whiteness across time, and thus marked as inside or outside the national imaginary (read as white) and the privileges that result from this belonging.&lt;ref&gt;''White By Law: The Legal Construction of Race''&lt;/ref&gt; Important to whiteness studies, according to scholars such as Richard Dyer, is understanding how white bodies are both invisible and hypervisible, and how representations of whiteness in visual culture reflect and, in turn, shape a persistent commitment to white supremacy in the U.S. even as some claim the nation is currently a colorblind meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;''White''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to visual culture, space also reproduces and normalizes whiteness. The sociologist George Lipsitz argues that whiteness is a condition rather than a skin color, a structured advantage of accumulated privilege that resurfaces across time spatially and obscures the racism that continues to mark certain bodies as out of place and responsible for their own disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz (2011)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lipsitz |first=George |title=How Racism Takes Place |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-43990-256-1 |pages=320 |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lv0musrlBGYC |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such attention to geography is an example of the way ethnic studies scholars have taken up the study of race and ethnicity across almost all disciplines using various methodologies in the humanities and social sciences.

In general, an "Ethnic Studies approach" is loosely defined as any approach that emphasizes the cross-relational and intersectional study of different groups. George Lipsitz again is important here, in demonstrating how the project of anti-black racism defines the relationship between the white spatial imaginary and other communities of color. Thus the [[redlining]] of the 1930s that prevented upwardly mobile African Americans from moving into all-white neighborhoods also forced Latino and Asian bodies into certain spaces.

==Relationship to other fields==

Ethnic studies exists in dialogue—and occasional tension—with a variety of related fields and disciplines.

In the case of traditional disciplines, ethnic studies often confronts resistance if not outright hostility to its mission. With many departments clinging to the ideal of objective and detached scholarship, the field is generally seen as a more politicized (and therefore, for some, a more troubling) form of academic inquiry. This hostility reflects, in some cases, a disinterest in the diversification of subject areas and the preservation of historically prominent fields. In the case of interdisciplinary fields, as ethnic studies has moved from a study of specific racial and ethnic groups towards the scrutiny of power dynamics, it has grown closer to fields like African American studies, Asian American studies, Native American studies, Latin@ studies, and American studies. Even more recently, ethnic studies has grown philosophically and politically closer to LGTBQ studies.

"Ethnic Studies" is often housed within departments or units with many different names. Teaching units often have a range of different names—Critical Ethnic Studies,&lt;ref name="las.depaul.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://las.depaul.edu/departments/critical-ethnic-studies/Pages/default.aspx|title=Critical Ethnic Studies  -  Academics  -  DePaul University College of LAS|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226101614/http://las.depaul.edu/departments/critical-ethnic-studies/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=December 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative American Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admission.wsu.edu/academics/fos/Public/field.castle?id=7584|title=Comparative Ethnic Studies - FOS - Admissions - WSU|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/ethnicstudies.php|title=Comparative Ethnic Studies Program - Ethnic Studies Department - UC Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or American Studies and Ethnicity&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/ase/&lt;/ref&gt;—for curricula and faculty who are gathered together under the same set of academic interests. A wide variety of curricula are employed in the service of each of these rubrics. Occasionally, the gap between American Studies and Ethnic Studies can be productively bridged, especially in departments where the bulk of faculty focus on race and ethnicity, difference and power. But that bridgework can be troublesome, obscuring one foci and sharpening the emphasis on another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/49761|title=American Indians, American Studies, and the ASA|first=Philip Joseph|last=Deloria|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=|volume=55|issue=4|pages=669–680|accessdate=June 14, 2016|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this great variation, though, ethnic studies needs to be understood within its specific institutional context. And, despite considerable financial (and often political) pressure to consolidate or eliminate ethnic studies within American Studies—or to house Native American studies, Latin@ studies, and Asian American studies within either ethnic studies or American Studies—the relationships between these fields should be considered within each institution's governing eco-system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitalcityhues.com/041714EthnicStudiesUW.html|title=The Capital City Hues/041714/The Future of UW-Ethnic Studies|first=Jonathan|last=Gramling|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional associations==

===National Association for Ethnic Studies (NAES)===

The [http://ethnicstudies.org National Association for Ethnic Studies] was founded in 1972 by several scholars who wanted to study race through an interdisciplinary approach. It was initially named the National Association of Interdisciplinary Studies for Native-American, Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican, and Asian Americans. The organization was officially renamed in 1985.&lt;ref name="ethnicstudies.org"&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/about/naes-history&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest ethnic studies association in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding, the organization has strived to promote scholarship, research, and curriculum design for its members.&lt;ref name="ethnicstudies.org"/&gt; The organization hosts an annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/things-to-do-in-the-area&lt;/ref&gt;

NAES also publishes the Ethnic Studies Review, a peer-reviewed journal for scholarship in ethnic studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/publications/review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical Ethnic Studies Association (CESA)===

The Critical Ethnic Studies Association began with its first conference in March 2011 at the University of California Riverside, Critical Ethnic Studies and the Future of Genocide: [[Settler colonialism]]/[[Heteropatriarchy]]/[[White Supremacy]]. This prompted the people who had organized and partaken in the conference to form the association. The second conference then took place in September 2013 at the University of Illinois Chicago and it was themed, Decolonizing Future Intellectual Legacies and Activist Practices. The third conference took place from April 30-May 2015 at York University in Toronto and it is titled, Sovereignties and Colonialisms: Resisting Racism, Extraction and Dispossession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/conference-information|title=CONFERENCE INFORMATION  - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530163243/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/conference-information|archivedate=May 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, ethnic studies has become entrapped within and similar to the mandates of liberal [[multiculturalism]], which relies on politics beholden to US nation-building and capitalist imperatives. Ethnic studies is in a difficult position, because as it gets more legitimizes within the academy, it has frequently done so by distancing itself from the very social movements that were the triggers for its creation. On the other hand, ethnic studies departments have always existed on the margins of the academic industrial complex, and become further marginalized through funding cuts due to the 2008 global economic crisis. Instead of just dismissing or wholly embracing identitarian nationalism, CESA seeks to construct an open dialogue around issues like white supremacy, settler colonialism, capitalism, and [[heteropatriarchy]], militarism, occupation, indigenous erasure, [[neocolonialism]], anti-immigration anti-Islam, etc. in order to expand the parameters and capacities of ethnic studies.

CESA's goal is not to romanticize all movements or dictate a specific relationship between scholars and activists. Instead, it questions the emphasis of professionalization within ethnic studies, the politics of the academic industrial complex, or the engagement of larger movements for social transformation. It recognizes that at times Ethnic Studies has been complicit in neutralizing the university, rather than questioning the university's ideologies actions, knowledge, and power. It works to situate the university as a point of contention, as a location among many for political struggles. CESA invites participation from all types of people: scholars, students, activists, arts, media makers, and educators of all fields, generations, and disciplines. The Critical Ethnic Studies Association was founded as a transnational, interdisciplinary, and un-disciplinary association of scholars, activists, students, artists, media makers, educators, and others who are directly concerned with interrogating the limitations of ethnic studies in order to better engage the historical stakes of the field. It organizes projects and programs to reimagine ethnic studies and its future through new interventions, both scholarly and activist based. They aim to develop an approach to scholarship, institution building, and activism animated by the spirit of the decolonial, antiracist, and other global liberationist movements that enabled the creation of Ethnic Studies in the first place. It hopes that this approach will continue to inform its political and intellectual projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/mission-vision|title=Mission &amp; Vision - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530163406/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/mission-vision|archivedate=May 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a huge emphasis on counteracting institutional marginalization, revisiting the ideas that prompted the creation of ethnic studies, and to create new conversations that challenge US hegemony in traditional ethnic studies. Their goals include establishing an interdisciplinary network of scholars and activists stimulating debate on critical ethnic studies, providing forums such as the biannual conference or dialogues thought seminars, social media, etc. There is also a focus on publishing a journal, ''Critical Ethnic Studies'', for new scholarships, and to facilitate dialogues that is critical and constructive between activist and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/history-goals|title=History &amp; Goals - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617094135/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/history-goals|archivedate=June 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In high schools==

===In California schools===
While ethnic studies courses have had a presence throughout high schools in Southwest states, there have been attacks on the discipline in the past couple of years, with the state of California never fully enforcing such courses in its high schools. However, students and educators of school districts across Southern California are pushing towards implementing ethnic studies courses into school requirements. The [[El Rancho Unified School District]] (ERUSD), which serves the area of Pico Rivera, became the first school district in California to require an ethnic studies class as part of its students' graduation requirement in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erusd.org/|title=El Rancho Unified School District|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic studies resolution in ERUSD was both drafted and proposed by ERUSD's board President, Aurora Villon and Vice President, Jose Lara and was presented as an effort to "expose ... students to global perspectives and inclusion of diversity".&lt;ref name="whittierdailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whittierdailynews.com/social-affairs/20140711/el-rancho-unified-school-district-authorizes-historic-ethnic-studies-graduation-requirement|title=El Rancho Unified School District authorizes historic ethnic studies graduation requirement|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This graduation requirement for ERUSD high school students is expected to be fully implemented by the 2015–2016 academic school year.&lt;ref name="whittierdailynews.com"/&gt;

In a similar move, [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD) will also begin to require ethnic studies courses in its high schools and will include such courses in its A-G graduation requirements. In November 2014, the LAUSD board approved a resolution proposed by board members Bennett Kayser, George McKenna and Steve Zimmer.&lt;ref name="laschoolreport.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-board-votes-to-add-ethnic-studies-to-schools-curriculum/|title=LAUSD board votes to add Ethnic Studies to schools' curriculum|date=November 19, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic studies curriculum will begin as a pilot program in at least five high schools.&lt;ref name="laschoolreport.com"/&gt; It is expected that by the 2017–2018 academic school year, every high school will offer at least one course in ethnic studies and the class would be compulsory by the time the class of 2019 graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ethnic-studies-20141209-story.html|title=L.A. Unified to require ethnic studies for high school graduation|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While LAUSD board members proposed the resolution, many students took on the efforts by creating petitions and rallies in support of the ethnic studies resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicstudiesnow.com/nov_23_bennett_kayser_fundraiser|title=Sunday (Nov 23) Bennett Kayser Fundraiser (EAGLE ROCK)|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicstudiesnow.com/lausd_rally_nov18|title=Nov 18 Rally &amp; Press Conference|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New York schools===

The New York State government has implemented the Dignity for All Students Act (DASA) which requires administrative, supervisory, and student service personnel to be trained in "Harassment, Bullying, Cyber bullying, and Discrimination in Schools: Prevention and Intervention".&lt;ref name="archive.advocate.nyc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.advocate.nyc.gov/bullying/DASA|title=About the Dignity for All Students Act|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, ethnic studies is framed through the lens of "bullying" as an challenge for minority students to get the most out of their education in a safe classroom environment. For the creators of DASA, bullying has the potential to disrupt a student's bodily and emotional safety.

DASA aims to do the following:&lt;ref name="archive.advocate.nyc.gov"/&gt;

*DASA is designed to protect public schools students from bullying by employees or other students based on actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or sex.
*DASA requires schools and districts to revise codes of conduct to prohibit bullying and promote a bully-free environment, and to include age-appropriate versions of the policy in codes of conduct. School districts will be required to post codes of conduct on their websites by July 1, 2013.
*DASA requires K-12 schools to incorporate curriculum that promotes awareness of and sensitivity to discrimination and diversity as part of civility and citizenship classes.
*DASA requires every school to nominate a Dignity Act Coordinator that will be responsible for handling incidents of bullying.
*DASA requires schools to collect and report data on bullying to the New York State education commissioner at least once a year.
*DASA prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports incidents of bullying.
*DASA holds the State education commissioner responsible for helping school districts develop effective responses to bullying that are focused on solutions, intervention and education.

==Political attacks==
Ethnic studies has always been opposed by different elements. Proponents of ethnic studies feel that this is a reactionary movement from the right. They note the rise of the conservative movement during the 1990s in the United States, in which the discipline came increasingly under attack. For proponents, the backlash is an attempt to preserve "traditional values" of Western culture, symbolized by the United States. For some critics, this  is a slant by proponents to disparage criticism by false association to right wing ideology. They have no objection about African, Latino or Native American culture being legitimate topics of academic research.  What they object to is the current state of ethnic studies which they see as characterized by excessive left wing political ideology, [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[relativism]] which, in their view, greatly undermined the scholarly validity of the research. However, ethnic studies is accused of promoting "racial separatism", "linguistic isolation" and "racial preference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223161232/http://www.acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm |date=December 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Ward Churchill]], a professor of ethnic studies at [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], came under severe fire for an essay he wrote called "[[On the Justice of Roosting Chickens]]", in which he claimed that the [[September 11 attacks]] were a natural and unavoidable consequence of what he views as unlawful US policy, and referred to the "technocratic corps" working in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as "[[little Eichmanns]]".&lt;ref name="college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm"&gt;{{cite news | title = College journalist touched off firestorm | author = Charlie Brennan | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = February 3, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/feb/03/college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative commentators used the Churchill affair to attack ethnic studies departments as enclaves of "anti-Americanism" which promote the idea of ethnic groups as "victims" in US society, and not places where serious scholarship is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldblatt |first=Mark |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200502090753.asp |title=nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200502090753.asp |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of such attacks, ethnic studies scholars are now faced with having to defend the field. In the media, this takes form of characterising the attack as right wing reactionary movement. For example, Orin Starn, a cultural anthropologist and specialist in Native American Studies at [[Duke University]], says: "The United States is a very diverse country, and an advocate would say we teach kids to understand multiculturalism and diversity, and these are tools that can be used in law, government, business and teaching, which are fields graduates go into. It promotes thinking about diversity, globalization, how we do business and how we work with nonprofits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2722200,00.html |title=denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2722200,00.html |work=Denver Post |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515114123/http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0%2C1413%2C36~53~2722200%2C00.html |archivedate=May 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to criticisms that ethnic studies academics undermine the study of a unified American history and culture or that ethnic studies are simply a "colored" version of American Studies, defenders point out that ethnic studies come out of the historically repressed and denied presence of groups within the U.S. knowledge-production, literature and epistemology. Efforts to merge ethnic studies with American studies have been met with fierce opposition as was the case at UC Berkeley. While the field is already decades old, the ongoing creation of new ethnic studies departments is fraught with controversy. Administrators at Columbia University attempted to placate student protests for the creation of an Ethnic Studies Department in 1996 by offering American Studies as a compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E2D81E39F93AA25757C0A960958260 |title=nytimes.com |work=New York Times |date=April 19, 1996 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arizona ban==

On May 11, 2010, Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] signed House Bill 2281 (also known as HB 2281 and A.R.S. §15–112), which prohibits a school district or charter school from including in its program of instruction any courses or classes that
#Promotes the overthrow of the Federal or state government or the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]
#Promotes resentment toward any race or class (e.g. racism and classism)
#Advocates ethnic solidarity instead of being individuals
#Are designed for a certain ethnicity
But the law must still allow:
#Native American classes to comply with federal law
#Grouping of classes based on academic performance
#Classes about the history of an ethnic group open to all students
#Classes discussing controversial history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf |title=Arizona House Bill 2281 (2010) |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming off the heels of SB 1070, [[Superintendent of Public Instruction]] Tom Horne was adamant about cutting [[Mexican-American Studies]] in the [[Tucson Unified School District]].  He devised HB 2281 under the belief that the program was teaching "destructive ethnic chauvinism and that Mexican American students are oppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Horne, [http://nau.edu/uploadedFiles/Academic/CAL/Philosophy/Forms/An%20Open%20Letter%20to%20Citizens%20of%20Tucson.pdf "An Open Letter to Citizens of Tucson"], June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011, Horne reported TUSD to be out of compliance with the law.  In June of that year, the Arizona Education Department paid $110,000 to perform an audit on the [[Mexican American Studies Department Programs, Tucson Unified School District|TUSD's program]], which reported "no observable evidence was present to suggest that any classroom within the [[Tucson Unified School District]] is in direct violation of the law." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2011/06/16/20110616tucson-ethnic-studies-audit0616.html "Tucson ethnic-studies program not illegal, audit says"] The Arizona Republic, June 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Huppenthal]] (elected Superintendent as Horne became [[Attorney General]]) ordered the audit as part of his campaign promise to "Stop La Raza", but when the audit contradicted his own personal findings of noncompliance, he discredited it.  Despite a formal appeal issued on June 22, 2011 by TUSD to Huppenthal, Judge Lewis Kowal backed the Superintendent's decision and ruled the district out of compliance in December, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Billeaud|first=Jacques|title=Ariz schools' ethnic studies program ruled illegal|url=https://news.yahoo.com/ariz-schools-ethnic-studies-program-ruled-illegal-021635252.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 10, 2012 the TUSD board voted to cut the program after Huppenthal threatened to withhold 10% of the district's annual funding.  Numerous books related to the [[Mexican-American Studies]] program were found in violation of the law and have been stored in district storehouses, including Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', [[Paolo Freire]]'s ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', and Bill Bigelow's ''"Rethinking Columbus: The Next 500 Years''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2012/01/13/whos_afraid_of_the_tempest/ "Who's afraid of 'The Tempest'?"] Salon, January 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of MAS see HB 2281 as another attack on the Hispanic population of Arizona.  This is due partly to the fact that none of the other three ethnic studies programs were cut. Support for the ethnic studies programs subsequently came from scholars, community activist groups, etc. For example, The Curriculum Audit of the Mexican American Studies Department refuted all of the violations under House Bill 2281. The audit instead recommended that the courses be implemented further, given the positive impacts of the courses on the students. In addition to the defense of the ethnic studies department, the UN Charter of Human Rights challenges the bill as a violation of fundamental human, constitutional, and educational rights (Kunnie 2010). A 2011 documentary, [[Precious Knowledge]] directed by Ari Palos and produced by Eren McGinnis for Dos Vatos Productions, argues that while 48% of Hispanic students drop out, TUSD's program had become a model of national success, with 93% of enrolled students graduating and 85% going on to college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosvatos.com/films/PreciousKnowledge/more.php "Precious Knowledge"] Dos Vatos Films, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The film shows a 165-mile community run from Tucson to Phoenix in protest of the state's decision, as well as student-led marches and stand-ins. 
In one instance, students overtook a board meeting by chaining themselves to the board members' chairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/education/students-protest-ethnic-studies-curriculum-change-4-26-11 "Students Protest Ethnic Studies Curriculum Change"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821045758/http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/education/students-protest-ethnic-studies-curriculum-change-4-26-11 |date=August 21, 2011 }} MyFoxPhoenix.com, April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  A student protest group, UNIDOS (United Non-Discriminatory Individuals Demanding Our Studies), has remained active speaking out before legislators and school board members on behalf of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tucson12.nytimes-institute.com/12/tucson-school-board-eliminates-mexican-american-studies-program/ "Tucson School Board Eliminates Mexican American Studies Program"] New York Times Student Journalism Institute, January 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate case, two students and 11 teachers sued the state, contending that the law is unconstitutional.  The teachers, however, have been denied standing in the lawsuit as public employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/01/11/42963.htm "Students, Not Teachers, Can Fight Ban on Ethnic Studies"] Courthouse News Service, January 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal of Arizona Ban ===
The Mexican American Studies course was first brought under attack after the Deputy Superintendent of Public Education gave a speech to students, countering an allegation that "Republicans  hate Latinos."&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/07/07/13-15657.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The students walked out of the speech, and Tom Horne, the Superintendent, blamed the rudeness of the students on the teachers from their Mexican American Studies courses. He called for removal of the courses. When his call was not answered, he made an effort for a bill to be put into law banning Mexican American Studies courses.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

House Bill 2281,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited the Mexican American Studies courses, was approved in December 2010. In an effort to enforce the bill, the district court gave the Superintendent of the school district the right to withhold funding to schools that continue to teach the ethnic studies course.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2011/12/27/judge-upholds-ethnic-studies-decision-orders-money-withheld-from-tusd/|title=Judge upholds ethnic studies decision, orders money withheld from TUSD – Arizona Capitol Times|last=Grado|first=Gary|date=2011-12-27|website=azcapitoltimes.com|publisher=Arizona Capital Times|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Kowal ruled the course “biased, political, and emotionally charged,” and upheld both the bill and the withholding of funding from schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An appeal was filed in October 2010.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; The initial appeal was challenging House Bill 2281&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; for violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (for viewpoint discrimination) and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (for void-for-vagueness) rights.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; This initial appeal was filed by 10 teachers, the director of the Mexican American Studies program, and 3 students and their parents.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Once the students graduated, 2 dropped their appeals, and the teachers and program director were dismissed for want of standing in January 2012.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; This left one student and her father on the appeal.

In March 2013, the appeals court ruled only in favor of the plaintiffs on the grounds that there was a First Amendment overbreadth violation to House Bill 2281.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; The plaintiffs decided to further appeal the case.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

On July 7, 2015, the appeal on the ban of the Mexican American Studies, "''Maya Arce vs Huppenthal''", reached a federal appeals court.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tonydiaz/discrimination-is-the-onl_b_7783704.html|title=Arizona Gets Schooled: Update on Ban of Mexican American Studies|last=Diaz|first=Tony|date=2015-08-11|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overseen by Judge Rakoff, the court reversed part of what the district court had ruled on banning the course. Judge Rakoff looked at the 4 categories (listed above) that constitute which classes are prohibited.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Rakoff's statement said that House Bill 2281 was created with the Mexican American Studies course in mind.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Since the Mexican American studies course was the only course in Arizona to be banned, it became clear that the bill had targeted the one course. This led the court to find the bill to be partially unconstitutional as it did not require similar Mexican American Studies courses outside of the Tucson Unified School District to cease teaching the courses. The bill also did not ban African American Studies courses that were being taught.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Rakoff's final ruling affirmed part of the bill to be unconstitutional regarding the plaintiff's First Amendment right.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; However, Rakoff upheld the district court's ruling that the bill is not overbroad.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Rakoff sent part of the appeal back to the district court to review the claim that the bill is discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

In August 2017, a different federal judge found that the bill was motivated by discriminatory intent, and struck down the ban on ethnic studies as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Depenbrock|first1=Julie|title=Federal Judge Finds Racism Behind Arizona Law Banning Ethnic Studies|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/08/22/545402866/federal-judge-finds-racism-behind-arizona-law-banning-ethnic-studies|website=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge felt that the ban had been passed "not for a legitimate educational purpose, but for an invidious discriminatory racial purpose and a politically partisan purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-cant-ban-mexican-american-studies-anymore-judge-says_us_5a442f28e4b025f99e199496|title=Arizona Can't Ban Mexican-American Studies Anymore, Judge Says|last=Planas|first=Roque|date=2017-12-28|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

'''Ethnocinema''', from [[Jean Rouch]]’s ''cine-ethnography'' and ''ethno-fictions'',&lt;ref&gt;Rouch, Jean. 2003. ''Cine-Ethnography''. Translated and edited by Steven Feld. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is an emerging practice of [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural]] filmmaking being defined and extended by [[Melbourne, Australia]]-based writer and arts educator, [[Anne Harris (educator)|Anne Harris]], and others. Originally derived from the discipline of [[anthropology]], ethnocinema is one form of ethnographic filmmaking that prioritises mutuality, collaboration and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "Race and Refugeity: Ethnocinema as Radical Pedagogy" in ''Qualitative Inquiry'' (ERA=B) Nov 1, 2010:16, pp. 768-777. http://qix.sagepub.com/content/16/9/768.short&lt;/ref&gt; The practice's ethos claims that the role of anthropologists, and other cultural, media and educational researchers, must adapt to changing communities, transnational identities and new notions of representation for the 21st century.

Ethno-cinematographers have also been associated with American historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] who has asserted that “all ethnographic representations are partial truths”.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus, (eds). 1986. ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley, CA: Univ of California Press., pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative ethnographic film and video projects are created with the intention of going beyond "preserving", "empowering" or "giving voice" to [[Marginalization|marginalised]] cultures, [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]], communities or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "‘You Could Do With A Little More Gucci’: Ethnographic Documentary Talks Back" in ''Creative Approaches to Research'', Vol 2:1, July 2009. Melbourne: RMIT Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; According to theorists, such voices already have [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and share community or agendas with ethnocinematic filmmakers. Ethnocinematic films primarily document "relationships"&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne and Nyuon, Nyadol: "Working It Both Ways: Intercultural Collaboration and the Performativity of Identity" ''The Australasian Review of African Studies'', Vol 31:1, June 2010.

Ethno-cinematographers include [[Jean Rouch]], [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004.

== History ==

Tobing Rony identifies three modalities in early ethnographic representation&lt;ref&gt;Tobing Rony, Fatimah. 1996. ''The Third Eye: Race, Cinema and Ethnographic Spectacle''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, pg 195.&lt;/ref&gt; including “ethnographic inscription” (Regnault), “taxidermic mode” (Flaherty’s ''Nanook''), and “self-reflexive” (Rouch’s films of the 1950s){{Clarify|date=July 2012}}. Of these, Rouch’s films are closest to being the forerunners of contemporary ethnocinema. Many film theorists and ethnohistorians have helped to define an evolving ethnographic film in the late 20th century, among them American [[Bill Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Bill. 1994. ''Blurred Boundaries: questions of meaning in contemporary culture''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema is typical{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} of a shift toward destabilizing traditional notions of representation, both in the West/North and in cultures and communities which had historically been the subjects of such films, and in which indigenous and diasporic peoples are taking control of their own representations, or working (as in ethnocinema) in intercultural collaboration. In addition to Rouch, this includes the work of such ethnographers and intercultural filmmakers as [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004. "Visual Anthropology". in ''A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians'', edited by T. Bilosi. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. Pp 506-525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David MacDougall|David]] and [[Judith MacDougall]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, ''Transcultural Cinema'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faye Ginsburg]], [[Timothy Asch]] and others.  More recently, indigenous filmmakers such as [[Essie Coffey]] (Australia) are collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works. Working against the [[observational cinema]] tradition, these filmmakers are all acknowledging and deconstructing Minh-ha’s observation that “Everywhere we go, we become someone’s private zoo”,&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, T. (1996) "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist literary theory: a reader''. (ed.) Eagleton, Mary. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pg 394.&lt;/ref&gt; and theorists like Harris continue to draw on her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Anne | year = | title = Someone's Private Zoo: Ethnocinema and the Other | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 1| page = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of early attempts to define ethnocinema include the 1972 "ethnocinematic experiment" of Sol Worth and John Adair documented in "American Indians and the ethnocinematic complex: From native participation to production control",&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L. 1989. "American Indians and the Ethnocinematic Complex: From Native Participation to Production Control". in ''Eyes Across the Water'', edited by R. M. Boonzajer Flaes. Amsterdam: Het Spinhuis. Pp 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which seven co-participants of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] heritage were given video cameras and asked to make films which were ‘Indian’; these films, however, were framed by essentialising notions of Other and did not seek to go beyond the researcher/researched [[dichotomy]]. Tobing Rony (1996) and Sam Pack (2000) consider developments in Indigenous media in relation to the anthropological notion of “native authenticity”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pack | first1 = Sam | year = 2000 | title = Indigenous media then and now: Situating the Navajo film project | doi = 10.1080/10509200009361497 | journal = Quarterly Review of Film and Video | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 273–286 [274] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why such essentialising notions are increasingly irrelevant in the 21st century’s ethnocinematic context. Yet the ability to truly collaborate in ethnographic research remains a contentious notion in anthropological and other circles, as ethnographic documentary scholar [[Jay Ruby]] asserts; what he calls ''Ethnographic Cinema'' must, he claims “be the work of academically educated and academically employed socio-cultural anthropologists”.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, J. ''Ethnographic Cinema (EC) - A Manifesto / A Provocation''  (n.d.)   {{cite web |url=http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195720/http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}. (Retrieved on: 17 May 2009), para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; By Ruby’s reckoning, what is emerging as ethnocinema has almost nothing to do with ethnographic films. By this definition, even Jean Rouch doesn’t qualify.

Conversely, Rouch encouraged the potential of ethnographic film as a “celebration of a relationship” between filmmaker and imaged, in which the “rapport and participation”&lt;ref&gt;Rouch 2003, pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; between both parties enhances any end-product that is collectively achieved. Loizos’s{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} claim (like Ruby’s) that contemporary filmmakers blur the lines between "authentic" ethnography and general [[documentary]] seems increasingly out of place. Traditional ethnographic filmmaking as a tool of anthropological researchers seeking to bring the stories of “distant peoples to audiences in North America and Europe”&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Karl G. 2006. ''Ethnographic Film''. Austin: University of Texas Press, pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly outmoded in a culture of [[YouTube]] and [[social networking]] sites screaming for video content.{{Why|date=July 2012}}

=== Toward a contemporary ethnocinema: some contradictions ===
The confusion continues. By 2006, there are still scant references to ethnocinema and they frequently conflict. One online [[blog]] characterises a Burmese festival as “a surrealist anti-documentary, with no voice-over, odd visual juxtapositions, and none of the quasi-academic tone that afflicts so much ''official ethno cinema''”.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. 2006. "Burmese Daze". Originally published in ''The Strange Attractor Journal'', No. 4. http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2007-04-01-1746-0.txt. (Retrieved on: 19 September 2009), para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  An abstract for an academic paper on the ritual branding of [[Andean cattle]] in [[Peru]] refers to the paper as an “ethnocinematographical study in which we reinterpret, with and in the film” the acts which they have recorded filmically, using the video cameras as “observation instruments”,&lt;ref&gt;Reyna, Carlos. 2005. ''Cinema e Antropologia: Novos diálogos metodológicos na interpretação de um ritual andino''. Biblioteca online de ciências da comunicação. http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/reyna-carlos-cinema-antropologia.pdf. (Retrieved on: 10 September 2009), pg 1.&lt;/ref&gt; none of which characterizes contemporary ethnocinematic work.

Several recent European [[film festival]]s list among their offerings the category of ethnocinema, without giving examples or defining the term. Still other contemporary film festivals appear to use the terms ''ethnographic'' and ''ethnocinematic'' interchangeably, which only adds to the confusion. In 2001, ''Notes From the Underground'', [[Goran Gocić]]’s insider look at the filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]], appeared in which he discusses what he alternatively calls ''ethno-cinema'' and then just "''ethno''". A ''[[Modern Language Association Review]]'' article opined, "The appeal of Kusturica's films … is that of "ethno" cinema, a cinema rooted in local traditions but expressed in "Western" form. This liberal political engagement with exotic subject matter is nonetheless, argues Gocić, an empowerment of the marginal."&lt;ref&gt;Haymes, Peter. 2004. "Review of ''Notes from the Underground: The Cinema of Emir Kusturica''". ''The Modern Language Review'', January. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7026/is_1_99/ai_n28245389/. (Retrieved on: 9 September 2009), pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

and from a far less favourable online book review:
he invests considerably more time to embracing instead his own recurring but vague references to 'ethno-cinema' as a base context from which Kusturica is operating (and by which Gocic seems to mean to have it both ways: indulging in [[exoticism]] and critiquing others' supposed essentializing). The only specific examples he offers to define this category are a handful of big budget Hollywood films involving Native Americans.''&lt;ref&gt;Karl, Brian Bernard. 2004. "Capturing Kusturica: On Gocić’s ''The Cinema of Kusturica''", ''Film Philosophy'', vol. 8, no. 12, 2004, para 24. http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol8-2004/n12karl. (Retrieved on: 20 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gocić himself says that, “inside film history itself, ethno cinema is the most exciting cinematic concept that the world has had to offer in the past two decades: aesthetically, it is difficult to argue against”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, Goran. 2001. ''The Cinema of Emir Kusturica: Notes from the Underground''. London: Wallflower Press, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, throughout the text his attempts to define ethnocinema contradict and obscure any practical working definition.  Gocić identifies "ethno" as having been around since the 1950s and as being typified by a sense of the “local”, including local motifs, but frequently made for a Western audience.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, only nine pages later he locates the birth of "ethno cinema" “in the late 1970s and early 1980s solely judging by the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] winners, which were Italian at the end of the 1970s”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gocić does attempt to characterise and define his version of ''ethno cinema'' with the following: “nostalgia,” (as a search for the “‘lost ‘authenticity’ of primitivism”), “intertextuality, openness and subjectivity (as postmodern characteristics), incredulity (or denial of ideology), and ‘double coding' or unexpected, surrealist, incongruous elements”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema, then, suggests that the voices/images of "women/natives/others"&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, Trinh T. 1996. "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist Literary Theory: A Reader'', edited by M. Eagleton. Cambridge MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; have something in common, and have agency in contributing to ethnographic film, whether independently or collaboratively, interculturally or intra-culturally. Current attempts to offer a working definition of ethnocinema may share more with the more recent movement of intercultural cinema which emerged around 1990. [[Laura Marks]] identifies this emergence as connected to three main factors: “the rise of multiculturalism … availability of funding … and an intellectual climate characterised by the disintegration of master narratives and a growing conceptualisation of knowledge as partial and contested”.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Laura U. 2000. ''The skin of the film: intercultural cinema, embodiment, and the senses''. Durham NC: Duke University Press, pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever its filmic and academic antecedents, ethnocinema is emerging, and – as Rouch has repeatedly shown us – "the other cannot be denied" as his/her image and means of production transforms.

In ethnocinema there is the belief that in the relationship which emerges through the shared project, both self and Other are understood and represented in newly constructed ways.  One way of disrupting traditional ethnographic documentary [[voyeurism]] is in making transparent the intercultural relationship normally shrouded behind the scenes. [[Gwendolyn A. Foster|Foster’s]] contention that controlling the means of production is "foregrounding subjectivity",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Gwendolyn A. 1997. ''Women Filmmakers of the African and Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity''. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is limited.  It presumes a one-way relationship between the content and construction of all ethnographic films (including ethnocinematic ones), and assumes that by creating the films the subject is empowered and the gaze is recast.  It ignores the complex relationship between reception and production, and classifies films created by marginalised filmmakers as more authentic, or even automatically transgressive in a dominant culture.   This cannot be assumed, either in content or reception.  We have moved well beyond [[orientalism]] and the temporary inability of the Other to represent her or himself, so that "they must therefore be represented by others",&lt;ref&gt;Said, E. 2000. ''Reflections on exile and other essays''. Boston: Harvard University Press, pg 206.&lt;/ref&gt; but similarly it cannot be assumed that self-representation is automatically "authentic" or an end in itself. In ethnocinema, relationship and process always take precedence over formal considerations.  Obviously, to achieve a wide viewing audience, formal concerns cannot be completely ignored, but these aesthetic concerns are addressed ''together'' in the co-creation of the films. In ethnocinema, there is no perception of a conflict between its ethnographic and [[popular culture]] characteristics. It remains ethnographic because it is grounded in cultural specificity, which is not essentialist and can be always-changing.  It does not seek to "document" a culture, as in ethnocinema culture is understood to be varied, diverse and always emerging.

=== Ethnocinema: new directions ===

In ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology'', Ruby calls for places where “critical standards are debated and canons develop”,&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2000. ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pg 23. Original edition, 1975 article.&lt;/ref&gt; and the need for ethnographic filmmakers to generate a set of critical standards analogous to those for written ethnographies. Harris agrees, and says that standards are needed, but diverges from Ruby’s definition in two important ways: firstly as a call to ethnocinematic filmmakers (whether academic or non-academic) that films included in this category must prioritise a post-colonial collaborative relationship between makers and imaged; and secondly, that Ruby’s so-called “marketplace considerations”&lt;ref&gt;Ruby 2000, pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt; need not pollute the product which is made. Ruby proposed in 2008 that “anthropologists should simply relinquish the term ethnographic to professional documentary filmmakers and seek another term to characterize their efforts”;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2008. "Towards an Anthropological Cinema": a talk given at the 2008 Nordic Anthropological Film Association Meetings in Ísafjörur, Iceland, June 6, 2008 (pg 3). www.media-anthropology.net/ruby_anthrocinema.pdf. (Retrieved on 10 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; while Harris proposes that ethnographic is being superseded by ''ethnocinematic'' filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "Too Tall, Too Dark, Too Something: New Racism in Australian Schools" in ''Trauma, Media, Art: New Perspectives'' (Eds) Broderick, M &amp; Traverso, A.  Cambridge Scholars Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4438-2283-3}}, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''fabula crepidata''''' or '''''fabula cothurnata''''' is a Latin tragedy with Greek subjects. The genre probably originated in adaptations of [[Greek tragedy]] (hence the names, coming from ''crepida'' = ''sandal'' and ''[[Buskin|cothurnus]]'') beginning in  the early third century B.C. Only nine have survived intact, all by [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca]]. Of the plays written by [[Lucius Livius Andronicus]], [[Gnaeus Naevius]], [[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], [[Lucius Accius]], and others, only titles, small fragments, and occasionally brief summaries are left. [[Ovid]]'s ''Medea'' also did not survive.

'''Family resemblance''' refers to physical similarities shared between close relatives, especially between [[parents]] and children and between [[siblings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abroadintheyard.com/dna-family-resemblance-across-generations/ Who Do You Look Like? DNA and Family Resemblance Across Generations]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], the similarities of [[personality]] are also observed.

==Genetics==
[[Heritability]], defined as a measure of family resemblance, causes traits to be genetically passed from parents to offspring ([[heredity]]), allowing evolutionarily advantageous traits to persist through generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolinska B | title = Resemblance and investment in children | language = fr | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 285–90 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 22385106 | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2011.645482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremblay BL, Guénard F, Lamarche B, Pérusse L, Vohl MC | title = Familial resemblances in human whole blood transcriptome | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 300 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29703154 | pmc = 5921553 | doi = 10.1186/s12864-018-4698-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bochud M | title = Estimating heritability from nuclear family and pedigree data | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 850 | pages = 171–86 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22307699 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-555-8_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Princeton Guide to Evolution|last=Brodie|first=Edmond | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2014 |isbn=|location=|pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sharing parents, siblings do not inherit identical genes, making [[Twin study|studies on identical twins]] (who have identical DNA) especially effective at analyzing the role genetics play in [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] similarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plomin R, Daniels D | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–82 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21807642 | pmc = 3147063 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have found that generational resemblance of many [[phenotypic trait]]s results from the inheritance of multiples genes that collectively influence a trait ([[Genetic variance|additive genetic variance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polderman TJ, Benyamin B, de Leeuw CA, Sullivan PF, van Bochoven A, Visscher PM, Posthuma D | title = Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies | language = En | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 7 | pages = 702–9 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25985137 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of heritability in personality traits. For example, one study found that approximately half of personality differences in high-school aged fraternal and identical twins were due to [[genetic variation]] - and another study suggests that no one personality trait is more heritable than another.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahern|first=Frank M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Ronald C.|last3=Wilson|first3=James R.|last4=McClearn|first4=Gerald E.|last5=Vandenberg|first5=Steven G. | name-list-format = vanc |date= May 1982 |title=Family resemblances in personality |journal=Behavior Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=261–280|doi=10.1007/bf01067847|issn=0001-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Family resemblance is also shaped by environmental factors, [[temperature]], [[light]], [[Human nutrition|nutrition]], exposure to [[drug]]s, the time that different family members spend in shared and non-shared environments, are examples of factors found to influence phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/environmental-influences-on-gene-expression-536|title=Environmental Influences on Gene Expression {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plomin R, Daniels D | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–82 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21807642 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq148 | pmc = 3147063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhUvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |title=Evolutionary Theory: Fringe or Central to Psychological Science|last=Sulikowski|first=Danielle | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-08-08|publisher=Frontiers Media SA|isbn=9782889199204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenotypes found to be largely environmentally determined in humans include [[personality]], [[Human height|height]], and [[Human body weight|weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eysenck|first=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36818">'''Fan fiction''' or '''fanfiction''' (also abbreviated to '''fan fic''', '''fanfic''', '''fic''' or '''ff''') is [[fiction]] about characters or settings from an original work of fiction, created by [[Fan (person)|fans]] of that work rather than by its creator. Fans may maintain the creator's characters and settings or add their own. It is a popular form of [[fan labor]], particularly since the advent of the Internet.

Fan fiction is rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work's creator or publisher and is rarely professionally published. It may or may not [[Copyright infringement|infringe on the original author's copyright]], depending on the jurisdiction and on such questions as for whether or not it qualifies as "[[fair use]]" (see [[Legal issues with fan fiction]]). Attitudes of authors and copyright owners of original works to fan fiction have ranged from indifference to encouragement to rejection. Copyright owners have occasionally responded with legal action.

The term "fan fiction" came into use in the 20th century as [[copyright|copyright laws]] began to delineate between stories using established characters that were authorized by the copyright holder and those that were unauthorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reporter.rit.edu/views/fanfiction-legal-battle-creativity|title=Fanfiction: A Legal Battle of Creativity|date=2016-02-05|work=Reporter Magazine|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For earlier works with similar characteristics, see [[Sequel#Unofficial sequels|unofficial sequel]] or [[pastiche]].

Fan fiction is defined by being both related to its subject's [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] [[fictional universe]]  (often referred to as "canon") and simultaneously existing outside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fan-Fiction-TV-Viewers-Have-It-Their-Way-1518184 |title=Fan Fiction—TV Viewers Have It Their Way |author=Schulz, Nancy | date=2001-12-31| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based.

==Earlier meanings of the term==
The term "fan fiction" has been attested in print as early as 1939; in this earliest known citation, it is used in a disparaging way to refer to amateurish science fiction (as opposed to "pro fiction").&lt;ref name="bravenewwords"&gt;{{cite book | title = Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction | editor = Jeff Prucher | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press, Inc. | location = New York | page = 57 | isbn = 978-0-19-530567-8 | url = https://books.google.pl/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in the 1944 ''Fancyclopedia'', an encyclopedia of fandom [[jargon]]. It is defined there as "fiction about fans, or sometimes about pros, and occasionally bringing in some famous characters from [science fiction] stories". The book also mentions that the term is "[s]ometimes improperly used to mean fan science fiction, that is, ordinary fantasy published in a fan magazine".&lt;ref name="bravenewwords" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fancyclopedia1944"&gt;{{cite book | title = Fancyclopedia | author = "John Bristol" | year = 1944 | publisher = The Fantasy Foundation | url = http://fanac.org/Fannish_Reference_Works/Fancyclopedia/Fancyclopedia_I/f1.html#8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Spockanalia2.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Star Trek'' fanzine ''Spockanalia'' contained the first fan fiction in the modern sense of the term.]]
The modern phenomenon of fan fiction as an expression of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fandom]] and their [[fanzine]]s published in the 1960s. The first ''[[Star Trek]]'' fanzine, ''Spockanalia'' (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example.&lt;ref name="verba2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan &amp; Zine History, 1967-1987 | author=Verba, Joan Marie | year=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka MN | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | isbn=0-9653575-4-6 | access-date=2017-04-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042451/http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | archive-date=2016-09-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} These fanzines were produced via offset printing and [[mimeograph]]y, and mailed to other fans or sold at [[science fiction conventions]] for a small fee to help recoup costs. Unlike other aspects of fandom, women dominated fan fiction authoring; 83% of ''Star Trek'' fan fiction authors were female by 1970, and 90% by 1973.&lt;ref name = "Coppa in Hellekson and Busse"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Francesca  | last = Coppa  | editor-last = Hellekson  | editor-first = Karen  | editor2-last = Busse  | editor2-first = Kristina  | contribution = A Brief History of Media Fandom  | title = Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet  | year = 2006  | pages = 41–59  | place = Jefferson, North Carolina  | publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]]  | isbn = 978-0-7864-2640-9 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar states that fan fiction "fill[s] the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen."&lt;ref name="cbs2000"&gt;{{cite book | title=Science Fiction Culture | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | author=Bacon-Smith, Camille | pages=112–113 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan fiction has become more popular and widespread since the advent of the World Wide Web; according to one estimate, fan fiction comprises one third of all content about books on the Web.&lt;ref name="boog20080918"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |title=Brokeback 33 Percent |work=Mediabistro |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |author=Boog, Jason |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210011535/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional fanzines and conventions, [[Usenet group]] [[electronic mailing lists]] were established for fan fiction as well as fan discussion. Online, searchable fan fiction archives were also established. The online archives were initially non-commercial hand-tended and fandom- or topic-specific. These archives were followed by non-commercial automated databases. In 1998, the not-for-profit site [[FanFiction.Net]] came online, which allowed anyone to upload content in any fandom.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news |last=Buechner |first=Maryanne Murray |title=Pop Fiction |date=March 4, 2002 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001950,00.html |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

One popular example of modern fan fiction is [[E. L. James]]' ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]''. This series was originally written as fan fiction for the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series of books and movies and played off the characters of Bella and Edward. In order to not infringe on copyright issues, James changed the character names to Anna and Christian for the purposes of her novels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/holy-crow-fifty-shades-grey-crazy-similar-its-twil-215185|title=Holy crow!

On May 22, 2013, the online retailer [[Amazon.com]] established a new publishing service, [[Kindle Worlds]]. This service would enable fan fiction stories of certain licensed media properties to be sold in the [[Kindle Store]] with terms including 35% of net sales for works of 10,000 words or more and 20% for short fiction ranging from 5000 to 10,000 words. However, this arrangement includes restrictions on content, copyright violations, poor document formatting and/or using misleading titles.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|title=Amazon's "Kindle Worlds" lets fan fiction writers sell their stories|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/technology/amazon-fan-fiction/?iid=HP_LN&amp;hpt=us_bn5|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=CNN Money|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese dōjinshi===
A similar trend in [[Japanese literature|Japan]] also began appearing around the 1960s and 1970s, where [[Self-published|independently published]] [[manga]] and novels, known as ''[[dōjinshi]]'', are frequently published by [[dōjin]] circles; many of these dōjinshi are based on existing [[manga]], [[anime]], and [[video game]] franchises. [[Mangaka|Manga authors]] like [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and [[Fujiko Fujio]] formed dōjin groups such as Fujio's {{nihongo|New Manga Party|新漫画党|Shin Manga-tō}}. At this time, dōjin groups were used by artists to make a professional debut. This changed in the coming decades with dōjin groups forming as school clubs and the like. This culminated in 1975 with the [[Comiket]] in Tokyo.

===Genres===
In addition to the "regular" [[list of genres]], which for fanfiction are usually determined by the work they're based on, there are a few genres that are closely associated with fanfic. Often, they also overlap. The genres include:

====Angst====
A story with an angsty mood centered on a character/characters who are brooding, sad, or in anguish.

====AU or alternate universe====
{{Main|Alternative universe (fan fiction)}}
Characters set in a universe other than their own canonical one.

====Crossover====
Works featuring characters, items, or setpieces from multiple fandoms.

====Darkfic====
Stories which are considerably grimmer and/or more depressing than the original, often in deliberate contrast to the canonical work(s). Not all stories tagged as "[[Darkness#Literature|dark]]" count as darkfic.  This is sometimes done with fandoms which are meant to be light-hearted or for children.

====Fix-fic====
A counterpart to darkfic, or perhaps its supergenre, fix-fic or more commonly known as "fix-it", refers to stories which rewrite canonical events that the author disliked, often because they were depressing or incomprehensible.

====Fluff or WAFF====
A story designed to be happy, and nothing else. The plot is usually less relevant in these types of works, as the main focus is to be cheerful. WAFF is short for "Warm And Fuzzy Feelings," and the two terms are quite similar in usage.

====Fusion====
Works blending two settings, and sometimes their casts, into a cohesive whole.

====Hurt/comfort====
A story in which a character is put through a traumatizing experience in order to be comforted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peggy Sue====
A story in which one of the characters is sent back in time, getting a second chance with knowledge of the original plot. Named after the movie ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', in which this happens to the titular character. [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] is an example of this happening repeatedly. Refers to both the story and the character in this situation. Not related to [[Mary Sue]].

====Rationalist rewrite====
Rebuild fiction that heavily features critical thinking skills and deductive reasoning. Also popularized by ''Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality''.

====Rebuild fiction====
A subtype of fix-fic, wherein aspects of the setting and/or characters are rewritten to be more cohesive. Named for the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' series, which originally qualified, and popularized by ''[[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]''.

====Self-insert====
A genre of fanfiction in which a version of the author is transported to, or discovers they are inside, the world the fanfiction is based on. Almost always [[first-person narration|written in the first person]]. Fanfictions of this type are often also fix-fics.

====Multicross self-insert====
Instead of a single fictional universe, the inserted author is taken to many in a row, and must usually solve some problem or complete some challenge in each place before moving on. Gaining new powers and occasionally companions from each world is common.

====Shipping====
A variant of [[list of genres#romance|romance]], focused on exploring a relationship between two or more characters from the original fandom(s). It has several subgenres, including Slash (which focuses on homosexual pairings, usually of the male variety), [[Femslash]]/Femmeslash/Yuri (same as Slash, but exclusively female/female), Crossover Shipping, which focuses on a romance between characters from multiple fandoms, and "friendshipping", which focuses on platonic relationships.

====Curtainfic====
A subcategory of shipping; describes romantic couples in mundane domestic situations such as picking out [[curtains]].

====Smut====
Smut is sexually explicit or pornographic writing. This could refer to a small portion of a story, or in its entirety.  The terms "lemon" and "lime" are often used to allude to the upcoming sexual scene.

====Songfic====
Songfic, also known as a song fic or a song-fic, is a genre of fan fiction that features a fictional work interspersed with the lyrics of a relevant song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfOTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter|last=Heilman|first=Elizabeth E.|date=2008-09-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135891541|pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbcqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Media Convergence Handbook - Vol. 2: Firms and User Perspectives|last=Lugmayr|first=Artur|last2=Zotto|first2=Cinzia Dal|date=2016-07-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642544873|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[portmanteau]] of "song" and "fiction"; as such, one might also see the genre referred to as "songfiction". As many lyrics are under [[copyright]], whether songfics are a violation of that copyright law is a subject of debate. Some fan fiction websites, such as FanFiction.Net, have barred authors from posting songfics with lyrics outside the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/|title=Guidelines|website=FanFiction.net|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay in ''Music, Sound, and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', [[University of Sydney]] professor [[Catherine Driscoll]] commented that the genre was "one of the least distinguished modes of fan production" and that "within fan fiction excessive attachment to or foregrounding of popular music is itself dismissed as immature and derivative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKxBuIcAoeEC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Music, Sound and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer|last=Attinello|first=Paul Gregory|last2=Halfyard|first2=Janet K.|last3=Knights|first3=Vanessa|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754660415|pages=114, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vent====
Vent refers to literature written by an author under duress or for therapeutic purposes, normally to calm themselves following a stressful or upsetting situation.

==Other related terms==

===A/N===
An abbreviation of "author's note".  Author's notes can be written at any point during a fanfiction (in some cases interrupting the flow of the piece by appearing within the body of a fanfiction), but are typically found directly before the beginning of a fanfiction or after it has concluded, and also at the starts or ends of chapters if the story is updated periodically. A/N's are used to convey direct messages from the author to the reader regarding the piece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Canon===
Canon is the original story. This means anything related to the original source including the plot, settings, and character developments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html|title=Common Fandom Terms|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclaimer ===
{{see also|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
[[Disclaimer]]s are author's notes typically informing readers about who deserves credit for the original source material,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|last=Freeman|first=Morgan|date=|website=|access-date=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often containing pseudo-legal language disavowing any intent of [[copyright infringement]] or alluding to [[fair use]]. Such "disclaimers" are legally ineffective and based on misunderstandings of [[copyright law]], particularly confusion between illegal copyright infringement and unethical [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/fan-fiction-plagiarism-and-copyright/|title=Fan Fiction, Plagiarism, and Copyright|date=18 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fandom ===
A [[fandom]] is a group of fans of a particular work of fiction (e.g. novel, film, television show or video game). Members of a fandom are typically interested in even minor details of the plot/characters of their fandom and often spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, that is why most fanfictions are written by members of a particular fandom(s).

===Fangirl/fanboy===
A female/male that is a part of one or more fandoms. Furthermore, the term fangirling/fanboying refers to a moment where a person "geeks out" or gets quite excited about a fandom.

===Fanon===
Fanon is an idea that is widely believed to be true among fans, but is unconfirmed, preventing it from being labelled as canon. Fanon may refer to a whole interpretation of the original work, or to specific details within it.

===Headcanon===
Headcanon is a fan's personal, idiosyncratic interpretation of canon, such as the backstory of a character, or the nature of relationships between characters. It may represent a teasing out of subtext present in the canon, or it may directly contradict canon. If many other fans share this interpretation, it may become fanon.

===Mary Sue===
Also of note is the concept of the "[[Mary Sue]]", a term credited as originating in ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan fiction that has crossed over to the mainstream, at least among editors and writers. In early ''Trek'' fan fiction, a common plot was that of a minor member of the USS ''Enterprise''{{'}}s crew saving the life of Captain Kirk or Mister Spock, often being rewarded with a sexual relationship as a result. The term "Mary Sue", originating in a parody of stories in this [[wish fulfillment]] genre, thus tends to refer to an idealized or fictional character lacking flaws, often representing the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segall |year=2008 |title=Fan Fiction Writing: New Work Based on Favorite Fiction |publisher=Rosen Pub. |page=26 |isbn=1404213562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OTP===
An abbreviation of the term "one true pairing", where the author or reader ships (wishes for a romantic relationship between) certain characters from a fandom. Additionally, OTPs are also subsetted as OT3s, which reference the reader's one true bonding with three people; this number can be changed to refer to larger bondings.

===RPF===
An abbreviation of "real person fanfiction". Describes fanfiction-like works written about real people, usually celebrities, instead of fictional characters.

===SI===
An abbreviation of self-insert, usually referring to either a story in the eponymous genre or to the author avatar within one.

===TW===
An abbreviation of "[[trauma trigger|trigger warning]]". Trigger warnings are meant to warn people of content in fics that could be harmful or "triggering" to those who have dealt with situations such as abuse. Fan fiction is tagged using various TWs so that readers may prepare for or avoid certain content. Sometimes CW, an abbreviation of "content warning", is used instead of or in addition to a TW. Trigger warnings are usually inserted when the subject matter of a work deals with things issues like drug abuse, mental illness, abuse, or extreme violence.

==Interactivity in the online era==
Reviews can be given by both anonymous and registered users of most sites, and sites are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback, making them a common way for readers and authors online to communicate directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/secure/review.php?storyid=3058878&amp;chapter=1&amp;storytextid=9301416' |title=Fanfiction.Net Review Form |publisher=[[Fanfiction.net]] |accessdate=April 24, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is intended for a type of bond between the reader and the writer, as well as helping the author improve their writing skills through [[constructive criticism]], enabling their to produce a better work next time.&lt;ref name="Merlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |title=Dr. Merlin's Guide to Fanfiction |author=Merlin, Missy |publisher=[[Firefox]] |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523223635/http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, unmoderated review systems are abused to send [[Flaming (Internet)|flames]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], or [[Internet troll|trolling]] messages. As a result, the author of the story can either disable or enable anonymous reviews, depending on their preference. Internet fan fiction gives young writers a wider audience for their literary efforts than ever before, resulting in improved literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Tosenberger, Catherine (2008) "Homosexuality at the Online Hogwarts: Harry Potter Slash Fanfiction" ''Children's Literature'' 36 pp. 185-207 {{doi|10.1353/chl.0.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{Main|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
Fan fiction is a [[derivative work]] under [[United States copyright law]].&lt;ref name="legal-derivativeWork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoosh.org/issue25/lee1a.html#41 |title=What's "Derivative Work?" |work=A Brief Introduction to Copyright for Fanfiction Authors |author=Lee, A.T. |publisher=Woosh! |date=October 1998 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that fan fiction does not fall under [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6673573.html Burns, Elizabeth, and Webbr, Carlie. "When Harry Met Bella: Fan fiction is all the rage. But is it plagiarism? Or the perfect thing to encourage young writers?"

Batts, permanently prohibiting publication in the United States of a book by Ryan Cassidy, a Swedish writer whose protagonist is a 76-year-old version of [[Holden Caulfield]] of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', may be seen as upholding this position regarding publishing fan fiction, as the judge stated, "To the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of Mr. C direct parodied comment or criticism at ''Catcher'' or Holden Caulfield, as opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Sewell |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/judge-rules-for-salinger-in-copyright-suit/?hp |title=Chan, Sewell.

Others such as the [[Organization for Transformative Works]] uphold the legality of non-profit fan fiction under the fair use doctrine, as it is a creative, [[Transformation (law)|transformative]] process.&lt;ref name="legal-fairUse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Legal |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]] |url=http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001030602/http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |archivedate=October 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Lucasfilm]] Ltd. sent out a letter to several [[fanzine]] publishers, asserting Lucasfilm's copyright to all [[List of Star Wars characters|''Star Wars'' characters]] and insisting that no fanzine publish [[pornography]]. The letter also alluded to possible legal action that could be taken against fanzines that did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |title=Quentin Tarantino's Star Wars?: Digital Cinema, Media Convergence, and Participatory Culture |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309235553/http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harry Potter Lexicon is one case where the encyclopedia-like website about everything in the Harry Potter series, moved towards publishing and commercializing the Lexicon as a supplementary and complementary source of information to the series. Rowling and her publishers levied a lawsuit against the website creator, Steven Vander Ark, and the publishing company, RDR Books, for a breach of copyright. While the lawsuit did conclude in Vander Ark's favor, the main issue in contention was the majority of the Lexicon copied a majority of the Series' material and does not transform enough of the material to be held separately from the series itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwabach|first=Aaron|title=The Harry Potter Lexicon and the World of Fandom: Fan Fiction, Outsider Works and, Copyright|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|year=2009|volume=70|issue=3|pages=387–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the HP Lexicon case is an example of Western culture treatment of fan fiction and copyright law, in China, Harry Potter fan fiction is less addressed in legal conflicts but is used as a cultural and educational tool between Western and Chinese cultures. More specifically, while there are a number of "fake" Harry Potter books in China, most of these books are treated as addressing concepts and issues found in Chinese culture. This transformative usage of Harry Potter in fan fiction is mainly from the desire to enhance and express value to Chinese tradition and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gupta |first=Suman |title=Re-Reading Harry Potter 2nd Ed. |year=2009 |publisher=Basingstoke (UK); New York (US): Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent authors have given their blessings to fan fiction, notably [[J.K. Rowling]]. Rowling said she was "flattered" that people wanted to write their own stories based on her fictional characters.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3753001.stm |title=Rowling backs Potter fan fiction |author=Waters, Darren |publisher=BBC |date=May 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Stephenie Meyer]] has put links on her website to fan fiction sites about her characters from the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |title=Twilight Series Fansites |publisher=StephenieMeyer.com |accessdate=October 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006021434/http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifty Shades (novel series)|''Fifty Shades'' trilogy]] was developed from a ''Twilight'' fan fiction originally titled ''Master of the Universe'' and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name "Snowqueen's Icedragon". The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in ''Twilight'', [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=mediabistro.com|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|title=The Lost History of ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|author=GalleyCat|access-date=2015-06-30|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140727045638/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|archive-date=2014-07-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=mtv.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685954/fifty-shades-of-grey-stephenie-meyer.jhtml |title=''Fifty Shades of Grey'': Stephenie Meyer Speaks Out |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of changing views on the subject, author [[Orson Scott Card]] (best known for the ''[[Enders Game]]'' series) once stated on his website, "to write fiction using my characters is morally identical to moving into my house without invitation and throwing out my family."

However, [[Anne Rice]] has consistently and aggressively prevented fan fiction based on any of her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' and its sequels in ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]''). She, along with [[Anne McCaffrey]] (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and [[Raymond Feist]], have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"/&gt; [[George R.R. Martin]], who was selected by ''Time'' magazine as one of the "2011 Time 100" and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgerrmartin.com/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions - George R.

== Introduction of feminization ==
Defining the term "feminization" can be complicated due to its meaning being unstable, as it can be portrayed as either a social process or as a critique of a process. Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Imhoff | first = Sarah | title = The myth of American Jewish feminization | journal = Jewish Social Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 126&amp;ndash;152 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | jstor = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | date = Spring–Summer 2016 | url = https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21871/The%20Myth%20of%20American%20Jewish%20Feminization.pdf?sequence=1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of poverty ==
Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees  and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm|title=Beijing +5 – Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 5-9 June 2000|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources have disputed the idea of a wage gap in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405|title=Harvard prof. takes down gender wage gap myth|last=Schow|first=Ashe|website=The Washington Examiner|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}
A "'''flip-flop'''" (used mostly in the United States), '''U-turn''' (used in the [[politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Pakistan]]), or '''backflip''' (used in Australia and New Zealand) is a sudden real or apparent change of policy or opinion by a public official, sometimes while trying to claim that both positions are consistent with each other. Often it will occur during the period prior to or following an election in order to maximize the candidate's popularity.

==History==

In his "On Language" column in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[William Safire]] wrote in 1988 that "flip-flop" has a long history as a synonym for "somersault". (He cited George Lorimer in 1902: "...when a fellow's turning flip-flops up among the clouds, he's naturally going to have the farmers gaping at him.") In the late 19th century, a US politician was called "the Florida flopper" by an opponent, Safire noted. The "fl" sound appearing twice is an indication of ridicule, he wrote. Citing grammarian Randolph Quirk, Safire pointed out that the doubling of the sound is also a feature in other two-word phrases used to disparage the actions or words of others, including "[[mumbo jumbo (phrase)|mumbo jumbo]]", "wishy-washy", and higgledy-piggledy".&lt;ref name="wsonnyt"&gt;Saffire, William, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D6113DF930A25750C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Phantom of the Phrases "], "On Language" column, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', March 13, 1988 (comment from Wicker is as quoted by Safire), retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the archives of ''The New York Times'', which go back to 1851, the earliest unequivocal mention of "flip-flop" as a change in someone's opinion, is in an October 23, 1890, report of a campaign speech in New York City. John W. Goff, candidate for district attorney, said of one of his opponents: "I would like to hear Mr. Nicoll explain his great flip-flop, for three years ago, you know, as the Republican candidate for District Attorney, he bitterly denounced [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] as a party run by bosses and in the interest of bossism.... Nicoll, who three years ago was denouncing Tammany, is its candidate to-day."&lt;ref&gt;No byline, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/10/23/103273441.pdf "Mighty cheers for Scott / A great meeting in Cooper Union last night."], news article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 23, 1890, retrieved from ''Times'' subscription archives June 23, 2008 (sometimes accessible without subscription)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used in 1967, when a ''New York Times'' editorial and ''Times'' columnist [[Tom Wicker]] used it in commenting on different events. It was also in the [[U.S. Presidential election, 1976|1976 election]], when President [[Gerald Ford]] used the phrase against his opponent [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=flip-flop&amp;srchst=p Search results for "flip-flop"], ''[[New York Times]]'' archives, 1850–1981, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 U.S. presidential election]], [[Michael Dukakis]] used the term against opponent [[Richard Gephardt]], saying, "There's a flip-flopper over here" about Gephardt.&lt;ref name="wsonnyt" /&gt;

The term also was used extensively in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]] campaign. It was used by critics as a catch-phrase attack on [[John Kerry]], claiming he was "flip-flopping" his stance on several issues, including the ongoing war in Iraq. Famously, on March 16, 2004, during an appearance at [[Marshall University]] Kerry tried to explain his vote for an $87 billion supplemental appropriation for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by telling the crowd, "I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it." After the remark became controversial, he explained that he had supported an earlier Democratic measure that would have paid for the $87 billion in war funding by reducing Bush's tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry discusses $87 billion comment |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/kerry.comment/ |publisher=CNN |id= |date=September 30, 2004 |accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FactCheck]] stated that "Kerry has never wavered from his support for giving Bush authority to use force in Iraq, nor has he changed his position that he, as President, would not have gone to war without greater international support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/bush_ad_twists_kerrys_words_on_iraq.html FactCheck.org: Bush Ad Twists Kerry's Words on Iraq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209150357/http://www.factcheck.org/bush_ad_twists_kerrys_words_on_iraq.html |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "U-turn" in the United Kingdom was famously applied to [[Edward Heath]], the [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1974. Prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] compiled a [[manifesto]] that highlighted [[free-market]] economic policies. Heath abandoned such policies when his government nationalised [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] (hence the actual "U-turn"). The Conservative government was later attacked for such a move because [[nationalisation]] was seen (by the [[Thatcherism|Thatcher era]]) as antithetical to Conservative beliefs. This later led to one of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s most famous phrases: "[[The lady's not for turning|you turn [U-turn] if you want to. The lady's not for turning]]". The Conservatives would adopt the free market under her.

==Exculpatory, ameliorating and aggravating circumstances affecting public reaction==

The circumstances surrounding the flip-flop and its larger context can be crucial factors in whether or not a politician is hurt or helped more by a change in position. "Long hailed as a conservative champion, [[Ronald Reagan]] could shrug off his support of a tax increase in 1982 to curb the budget deficits his 1981 tax cut had exacerbated," according to an analysis of flip-flopping in ''The New York Times''. "Long suspect on the Republican right, [[George H. W. Bush|George [H. W.] Bush]] faced a crippling 1992 primary challenge after abandoning his 'no new taxes' campaign pledge in the White House."&lt;ref name="jhnyt"&gt;Harwood, John, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/us/politics/23caucus.html "Flip-Flops Are Looking Like a Hot Summer Trend"], "The Caucus" feature, ''The New York Times'', June 23, 2008, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry's perceived equivocation on the Iraq war damaged his 2004 campaign, according to both Democratic and Republican political operatives. "It spoke to a pattern of calculation and indecisiveness that make him look like a weak commander in chief compared to [George W.] Bush", said Jonathan Prince, a strategist for 2008 presidential candidate [[John Edwards]], Kerry's running mate in 2004. In the 2008 primary season, Edwards simply stated that "I was wrong" when he had voted in the U.S. Senate to authorize the Iraq War. "Progressives loved it because it was taking responsibility, not abdicating it," according to Prince.&lt;ref name="jhnyt" /&gt;

United States commentator [[Jim Geraghty]] has written that politicians need to be allowed some leeway in changing their minds as the result of changing conditions. "I actually think that a candidate can even change his position in response to a changing political environment, as long as they're honest about it. 'The votes just aren't there, public support isn't there, so I have to put this proposal on the back burner for a while,' is a perfectly legitimate response to a difficult position."&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, Jim, [http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmVmYzM2NTEwZWI5MTI1ODgyNmUyZGMzMDU0ZTgyNzU= "Measuring the Flip-Flops"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} post at "The Campaign Spot" blog at the "National Review Online" website, June 23, 2008, 12:32&amp;nbsp;pm post, accessed same day{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same general point was made in 1988 by ''New York Times'' editorial columnist [[Tom Wicker]], writing shortly after Dukakis' charge against Gephardt. Wicker commented that the accusation was not necessarily fair: "What's wrong with a Presidential candidate changing his position – though his opponents call it 'flip-flopping' – in order to improve his chances of winning? Nothing's wrong with it [...] unless the flipper [...] denies having done it," Wicker added that the charge can be "a tortured or dishonest interpretation of an opponent's record".&lt;ref name="wsonnyt" /&gt;

"[T]here's a difference between changing your policy position and breaking a promise," [[John Dickerson (journalist)|John Dickerson]], wrote in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' online magazine. "Breaking a promise is a problem of a higher order than changing a policy position. Our mothers told us not to break promises [...]"&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, John, [http://www.slate.com/id/2194083?nav=wp "The Flip-Flop Brothers: Both McCain and Obama wobbled. Who will pay the price?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, June 20, 2008, 6:32&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern Time, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

James Pethokoukis, the "money and politics blogger" for ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' online, referring to 2008 presidential candidate [[John McCain]], noted that in changing a position a candidate can "trot out that famous [[John Maynard Keynes]] line, 'When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?'"&lt;ref&gt;Pethoukoukis, James, [https://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/6/16/7-ways-mccain-can-use-energy-to-beat-obama.html "7 Ways McCain Can Use Energy to Beat Obama"], "Capital Commerce" blog, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' online, June 16, 2008, 01:02&amp;nbsp;pm ET, retrieved June 23, 2008{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Keynes quote also has been mentioned by other commentators with regard to flip-flops, including James Broder, in a 2007 article in the ''[[International Herald-Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="jbiht"&gt;Broder, John M., [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=140971 "In past, clues to way Fed chief met mortgage crisis"], ''[[The International Herald-Tribune]]'', August 19, 2007, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-political use==
Outside politics the use of the term is not as pejorative. A scientist or mathematician can often obtain some experimental results or logical proofs which causes one to flip flop on a previously held belief. Example: "I always assumed that there was an infinity, that all infinite numbers were equal, but I have flip flopped on that since I saw Georg Cantor's proof." Lewis Eigen, in his essay on the cultural difference between politics and scientists, observes, "To the scientist, failure to flip-flop in the face of contradictory evidence is irrational and dangerous behavior. And scientists will often flip-flop at almost light speed. Often it takes only a single observation to flip-flop thousands of scientifically learned people."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D. Eigen, "Flip-Flop: Political Vice–Scientific Virtue". ''Scriptamus'', 2009, http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/flip-flop-political-vice-scientific-virtue/&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of '''geometric morphometrics in anthropology''' has made a major impact on the field of [[morphometrics]] by aiding in some of the technological and methodological advancements. Geometric morphometrics is an approach that studies shape using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] landmark and semilandmark coordinates that are capable of capturing morphologically distinct shape variables. The landmarks can be analyzed using various statistical techniques separate from size, position, and orientation so that the only variables being observed are based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Geometric morphometrics is used to observe variation in numerous formats, especially those pertaining to evolutionary and biological processes, which can be used to help explore the answers to a lot of questions in [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zelditch2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Geometric morphometrics is part of a larger subfield in anthropology, which has more recently been named virtual anthropology. Virtual anthropology looks at virtual morphology, the use of virtual copies of specimens to perform various quantitative analyses on shape (such as geometric morphometrics) and form...&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=Gerhard|title=Virtual Anthropology|journal=Yearbook of Physical Anthropology|date=2015|issue=156|pages=22–42|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22658|pmid=25418603|volume=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The field of geometric morphometrics grew out of the accumulation of improvements of methods and approaches over several decades beginning with [[Francis Galton]] (1822-1911). Galton was a polymath and the president of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Slice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slice|first1=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=2007|issue=1|pages=261–81|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120613|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 he invented a way to quantify facial shapes using a base-line registration approach for shape comparisons.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitteroecker|first1=Philipp|last2=Gunz|first2=Philipp|title=Advances in Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Evolutionary Biology|date=2009|issue=2|pages=235–247|doi=10.1007/s11692-009-9055-x|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; This was later adapted by Fred Bookstein and termed “two-point coordinates” or “Bookstein-shape coordinates”.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|title=Morphometric Tools for Landmark Data: Geometry and Biology|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

In the 1940s, [[D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (biologist and mathematician, 1860-1948)  looked at ways to quantify that could be attached to biological shape based on developmental and evolutionary theories. This led to the first branch of multivariate morphometrics, which emphasized matrix manipulations involving variables.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohlf|first1=F. James|last2=Bookstein|first2=Fred L.|title=Proceedings of the Michigan Morphometrics Workshop|date=1990|publisher=Special Publication 2, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fred Bookstein (currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of Vienna) began using Cartesian transformations and [[David George Kendall]] (statistician, 1918-2007) showed that figures that hold the same shape can be treated as separate points in a geometric space.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Gunz|first3=Philipp|last4=Mitteroecker|first4=Philipp|title=Anthropology Takes Control of Morphometrics|journal=Collegium Antropologicum|date=2004|volume=2|issue=28|pages=121–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1996, Leslie Marcus (paleontologist, 1930-2002) convinced colleagues to use morphometrics on the famous [[Ötzi|Ötzi skeleton]], which helped expose the importance of the applications of these methods.&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004 /&gt;

==Traditional morphometrics==
[[File:BirdMorpho.svg|thumb|left|BirdMorpho]] 
Traditional morphometrics is the study of morphological variations between or within groups using multivariate statistical tools. Shape is defined by collecting and analyzing length measurements, counts, ratios, and angles.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Mark|last2=Sheets|first2=David H.|title=A Practical Introduction to Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Paleontological Society Papers|date=2010|volume=16|issue=Quantitative Methods in Paleobiology|pages=163–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Dean C.|last2=Rohlf|first2=F. James|last3=Slice|first3=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics: Ten Years of Progress Following the 'Revolution'|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|date=2004|volume=71|pages=5–16|doi=10.1080/11250000409356545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The statistical tools are able to quantify the covariation within and between samples. Some of the typical statistical tools used for traditional morphometrics are: [[principal components]], [[factor analysis]], [[canonical analysis|canonical variate]], and [[discriminant function analysis]]. It is also possible to study [[allometry]], which is the observed change in shape when there is change in size. However, there are problems pertaining to size correction since linear distance is highly correlated with size. There have been multiple methods put forth to correct for this correlation, but these methods disagree and can end up with different results using the same dataset. Another problem is linear distances are not always defined by the same landmarks making it difficult to use for comparative purposes.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; For shape analysis itself, which is the goal of morphometrics, the biggest downside to traditional morphometrics is that it does not capture the complete variation of shape in space, which is what the measurements are supposed to be based on.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; For example, if one tried to compare the length and width for an oval and tear drop shape with the same dimensions they would be deemed as the same using traditional morphometrics.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; Geometric morphometrics tries to correct these problems by capturing more variability in shape.

==Steps in a geometric morphometric study==
There is a basic structure to successfully performing and completing every geometric morphometric study:
# '''Design Study''': what is your objective/hypothesis? what morphology must you capture to explore this? 
# '''[[#Data Collection Methods|Collect Data]]''': choose your landmark set and method of collection
# '''[[#Superimposition|Standardize Data]]''': make your landmarks comparable across all specimens (superimposition) 
# '''[[#Statistical Analysis|Analyze Data]]''': choose a statistical approach depending on your original question and how you designed the study 
# '''[[#Some Applications in Physical Anthropology|Interpret Results]]''': take the outcome of your statistical analysis and reflect it back to the context of your original specimens

==Data collection methods==

===Landmarks===
The first step is to define your landmark set. Landmarks have to be anatomically recognizable and the same for all specimens in the study. Landmarks should be selected to properly capture the shape trying to be observed and capable of being replicated. The sample size should be roughly three times the amount of landmarks chosen and they must be recorded in the same order for every specimen.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===Semilandmarks===
[[File:3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl.png|thumb|upright=0.5|3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl]]
Semilandmarks, also called sliding landmarks, are used when the location of a landmark along a curvature might not be identifiable or repeatable.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Semilandmarks were created in order to take landmark based geometric morphometrics to the next step by capturing the shape of difficult areas such as smooth curves and surfaces.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; In order to obtain a semilandmark, the curvature still has to start and end on definable landmarks, capture observed morphology, remain homologous across specimens in the same steps seen above for regular landmarks, be equal in number, and equally distant apart.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; When this approach was first proposed, Bookstein suggested gaining semilandmarks by densely sampling landmarks along the surface in a mesh and slowly thinning out the landmarks until the desired curvature was obtained.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Newer landmark programs aid in the process but there are still some steps that must be taken in order for the semilandmarks to be the same across the whole sample. Semilandmarks are not placed on the actual curve or surface but on tangent vectors to the curve or tangent planes to the surface. The sliding of semilandmarks in new programs is performed by either selecting a specimen to be the model specimen for the rest of the specimens or using a computational sample mean from tangent vectors. Semilandmarks are automatically placed in most programs when the observer chooses a starting and ending point on definable landmarks and sliding the semilandmarks between them until the shape is captured. The semilandmarks are then mapped onto the rest of the specimens in the sample.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Since shape will differ between specimens, the observer has to manually go through and make sure the landmarks and semilandmarks are on the surface for the rest of the specimens. If not they must be moved to touch the surface, but this process still maintains the correct location. There is still room for improvement to these methods but this is the most consistent option at the moment. Once mapped on, these semilandmarks can be treated just like landmarks for statistical analysis.

===Deformation grid===
This is a different approach to data collection than using landmarks and semilandmarks. In this approach, deformation grids are used to capture the morphological shape differences and changes. The general idea is that shape variations can be recorded from one specimen to another based on the distortion of a grid.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Bookstein proposed the use of a [[thin-plate spline]] (TPS) interpolation, which is a computed deformation grid that calculates a mapping function between two individuals that measures point differences.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Basically, the TPS interpolation has a template computed grid that is applied to specimens and the differences in shape can be read from the different deformations of the template.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The TPS can be used for both two- and three-dimensional data, but has proved less effective for visualizing three-dimensional differences, but it can easily be applied to the pixels of an image or volumetric data from CT or MRI scans.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Superimposition==

===[[Generalized Procrustes analysis]] (GPA)===
Landmark and semilandmark coordinates can be recorded on each specimen, but size, orientation, and position can vary for each of those specimens adding in variables that distract from the analysis of shape. This can be fixed by using superimposition, with generalized procrusted analysis (GPA) being the most common application. GPA removes the variation of size, orientation, and position by superimposing the landmarks in a common coordinate system.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The landmarks for all specimens are optimally translated, rotated, and scaled based on a least-squared estimation. The first step is translation and rotation to minimize the squared and summed differences (squared Procrustes distance) between landmarks on each specimen. Then the landmarks are individually scaled to the same unit Centroid size. Centroid size is the square root of the sum of squared distances of the landmarks in configuration to their mean location. The translation, rotation, and scaling bring the landmark configurations for all specimens into a common coordinate system so that the only differing variables are based on shape alone. The new superimposed landmarks can now be analyzed in multivariate statistical analyses.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

==Statistical analysis==

===[[Principal components analysis]] (PCA)===
In general, principal components analysis is used to construct overarching variables that take the place of multiple correlated variables in order to reveal the underlying structure of the dataset. This is helpful in geometric morphometrics where a large set of landmarks can create correlated relationships that might be difficult to differentiate without reducing them in order to look at the overall variability in the data.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Reducing the number of variables is also necessary because the number of variables being observed and analyzed should not exceed sample size.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Principal component scores are computed through an eigendecomposition of a sample’s covariance matrix and rotates the data to preserve procrustes distances. In other words, a principal components analysis preserves the shape variables that were scaled, rotated, and translated during the generalize procrustes analysis. The resulting principal component scores project the shape variables onto low-dimensional space based on eigenvectors.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The scores can be plotted various ways to look at the shape variables, such as scatterplots. It is important to explore what shape variables are being observed to make sure the principal components being analyzed are pertinent to the questions being asked. Although the components might show shape variables not relevant to the question at hand, it is perfectly acceptable to leave those components out any further analysis for a specific project.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

===[[Partial least squares regression|Partial least squares]] (PLS)===
Partial least squares is similar the principal components analysis in the fact that it reduces the number of variables being observed so patterns are more easily observed in the data, but it uses a linear regression model. PLS is an approach that looks at two or more sets of variables measured on the same specimens and extracts the linear combinations that best represent the pattern of covariance across the sets.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The linear combinations will optimally describe the covariances and provide a low-dimensional output to compare the different sets. With the highest shape variation covariance, mean shape, and the other shape covariances that exists among the sets, this approach is ideal for looking at the significance of group differences. PLS has been used a lot in studies that look at things such as sexual dimorphism, or other general morphological differences found at the population, subspecies, and species level.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; It has also been used to look at functional, environmental, or behavioral differences that could influence the found shape covariance between sets&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===[[Multivariate statistics|Multivariate regression]]===
Multiple or multivariate regression is an approach to look at the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and a dependent or influential variable. It is best used in geometric morphometrics when analyzing shape variables based on an external influence. For example, it can be used in studies with attached functional or environmental variables like age or the development over time in certain environments.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The multivariate regression of shape based on the logarithm of centroid size (square root of the sum of squared distances of landmarks) is ideal for [[allometric]] studies. Allometry is the analysis of shape based on the biological parameters of growth and size. This approach is not affected by the number of dependent shape variables or their covariance, so the results of regression coefficients can be seen as a deformation in shape.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Some applications in anthropology==

===Human evolution===

====The human brain====
The human brain is unique from other species based on the size of the [[visual cortex]], [[temporal lobe]], and [[parietal cortex]], and increased [[gyrification]] (folds of the brain). There have been many questions as to why these changes occurred and how they contributed to cognition and behavior, which are important questions in human evolution. Geometric morphometrics has been used to explore some of these questions using virtual [[endocasts]] (casts of the inside of the cranium) to gather information since brain tissue does not preserve in the fossil record. Geometric morphometrics can reveal small shape differences between brains such as differences between modern humans and [[Neanderthals]] whose brains were similar in size.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rein|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Harvati|first2=Katerina|title=Geometric Morphometrics and Virtual Anthropology: Advances in human evolutionary studies|journal=Journal of Biological and Clinical Anthropology|date=2014|volume=71|pages=41–55|doi=10.1127/0003-5548/2014/0385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neubauer and colleagues looked at the endocasts of [[chimpanzees]] and modern humans to observe brain growth using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found that there is an early “[[globularization]] phase” in human brain development that shows expansion of the parietal and cerebellar areas, which does not occur in chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neubauer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neubauer|first1=S.|last2=Gunz|first2=P.|last3=Hublin|first3=J.|title=Endocranial shape changes during growth in chimpanzees and humans: A morphometric analysis of unique and shared aspects|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=555–566|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.011|pmid=20727571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunz and colleagues extended the study further and found that the “globularization phase” does not occur in Neanderthals and instead Neanderthal brain growth is more similar to chimpanzees. This difference could point to some important changes in the human brain that led to different organization and cognitive functions&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Golovanova|first3=L.|last4=Doronichev|first4=V.|last5=Maureille|first5=B.|last6=Hublin|first6=J.|title=A uniquely modern human pattern of endocranial development: Insights from a new cranial reconstruction of the Neanderthal newborn from Mezmaiskaya|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=62|issue=2|pages=300–313|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.11.013|pmid=22221766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Maureille|first3=B.|last4=Hublin|first4=J.|title=Brain development after birth differs between Neanderthals and modern humans|journal=Current Biology|date=2010|volume=20|issue=21|pages=921–922|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.10.018|pmid=21056830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pleistocene cranial morphology====
There have been many debates on the relationships between [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] hominin crania from [[Eurasia]] and Africa because they display a mosaic of both primitive and derived traits. Studies on cranial morphology for these specimens have created arguments that Eurasian fossils from the Middle Pleistocene are a transition between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and later hominins like Neanderthals and modern humans. However, there are two sides to the argument with one side saying that the European and African fossils are from a single taxon while others say that the Neanderthal lineage should be included. Harvati and colleagues decided to attempt to quantify the craniofacial features of Neanderthals and European Middle Pleistocene fossils using 3D landmarks to try to add to the debate.

They found similarities in facial morphology between Middle Pleistocene fossils from Europe and Africa and a divide in facial morphology during the Pleistocene based on time period. The study also found that some characteristics separating Neanderthals from Middle Pleistocene hominins, like the size of the nasal aperture and degree of midfacial prognathism, might be due to allometric differences&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Freidline&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freidline|first1=SE|last2=Gunz|first2=G.|last3=Harvati|first3=K.|last4=Hublin|first4=J|title=Middle Pleistocene human facial morphology in an evolutionary and developmental context|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=63|issue=5|pages=723–740|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.08.002|pmid=22981042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern human variation===

====Ancestry and sex estimation of crania====
Crania can be used to classify ancestry and sex to aid in [[forensic]] contexts such as crime scenes and mass fatalities. In 2010, Ross and colleagues were provided federal funds by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] to compile data for population specific classification criteria using geometric morphometrics. Their aim was to create an extensive population database from 3D landmarks on human crania, to develop and validate population specific procedures for classification of unknown individuals, and develop software to use in forensic identification. They placed 3D landmarks on 75 craniofacial landmarks from European, African, and Hispanic populations of about 1000 individuals with a Microscribe digitizer. The software they developed, called [http://www.3d-id.org/ 3D-ID], can classify unknown individuals into probable sex and ancestry, and allows for fragmentary and damaged specimens to be used.&lt;ref name=RossSlice&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Ann H.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Williams|first3=Shanna E.|title=Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls|date=2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the full manuscript can be found here: [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls]

====Sex estimation of os coxae====
Geometric morphometrics can also be used to capture the slight shape variations found in postcranial bones of the human body such as ''[[os coxae]]''. Bierry and colleagues used 3D CT reconstructions of modern adult pelvic bones for 104 individuals to look at the shape of the [[obturator foramen]]. After a normalization technique to take out the factor of size, they outlined the obturator foramen with landmarks and semilandmarks to capture its shape. They chose the obturator foramen because it tends to be oval in males and triangular in females. The results show a classification accuracy of 88.5% for males and 80.8% for females using a [[Fourier Analysis|Discriminant Fourier Analysis]].&lt;ref name=Bierryetal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bierry|first1=Guillaume|last2=Le Minor|first2=Jean-Marie|last3=Schmittbuhl|first3=Mathieu|title=Oval in Males and Triangular in Females?

They placed landmarks and semilandmarks on 2D photographic images of 121 left pelvic bones from a collection of undocumented skeletons at the Museu Anthropológico de Coimbra in Portugal. Since the pelvic bones were of unknown origin, they used a [[K-means clustering|K-means Cluster Analysis]] to determine a sex category before performing a [[Discriminant function analysis|Discriminant Function analysis]]. The results had a classification accuracy for the [[greater sciatic notch]] of 90.9% and the ischiopubic ramus at 93.4 to 90.1%&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Paula N.|last2=Bernal|first2=Valeria|last3=Perez|first3=Ivan S.|title=Geometric Morphometric Approach to Sex Estimation of Human Pelvis|journal=Forensic Science International|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.04.012|volume=189|issue=1–3|pages=68–74|pmid=19442464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">The '''Glasgow Chronology''' is a proposed revision of the [[Egyptian chronology]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was first formulated between the years 1978 and 1982 by a working group following the Glasgow Conference of Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS, a non-profit organization advocating serious academic analysis of the writings of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and other [[catastrophism|catastrophist]]s).&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Thebes, or, Ages in chaos revisited|author=Emmet John Sweeney|pages=19|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2007| isbn=9780875864808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[chronology]] placed the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] some five hundred years later than the [[conventional chronology of Egypt]].

==Chronology formation==
The Glasgow Chronology was initially presented at an SIS conference, held in 1978 in [[Glasgow]] and entitled "Ages in Chaos?". Flaws were pointed out in it almost immediately, and by the 1980s its original proponents had all abandoned it, in favour of other chronologies.&lt;ref name=Sweeney /&gt;

The Glasgow Chronology accepted all the character identifications proposed by [[Velikovsky]] in ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952). Thus [[Hatshepsut]], who visited the Divine Land, was equated with the [[Queen of Sheba]], who visited [[Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]], whilst [[Thutmose III]], who followed Hatshepsut, was equated with [[Shishak]], who plundered the Jerusalem temple after the death of Solomon. Velikovsky therefore reduced the age of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty]] by five centuries. However, in his subsequently published ''Ramses II and his Time'' (1978), he brought the Nineteenth dynasty down by roughly seven centuries, thus opening a two-century gap between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties. Despite the Glasgow Chronology intent of reducing the age of the Nineteenth dynasty by five centuries and allowing it to naturally follow from the Eighteenth dynasty, its original proponents concluded that it was historically insupportable.

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humanistic Informatics''' (also known as '''Humanities informatics''') is one of several names chosen for the study of the relationship between [[human culture]] and [[technology]]. The term is fairly common in [[Europe]], but is little known in the [[English-speaking world]], though [[Digital Humanities]] (also known as '''Humanities computing''') is in many cases roughly equivalent. 

Humanistic informatics departments were generally started in the 1990s when universities rarely taught humanities-based approaches to the rapidly developing computerized society. For this reason, the field was quite broadly defined, and included courses in humanities computing, basic introductions to how computers work, historical developments of technology, technology and learning, digital art and literature and digital culture. Today several departments have declared more specialized areas of research, such as digital arts and culture at the [[University of Bergen]], and socio-cultural communication with and without technology at the [[University of Aalborg]].

Digital Humanities is a primary topic, and there are several universities in the US and the UK that have Digital Arts and Humanities research and development centers. One aspect of Digital Humanities that will grow will be the intersection of new digital media and the humanities, particularly in the gaming industry which has developed both casual and serious gaming and game design strategies to foster learning in the humanities and all other academic disciplines. A key principle in all digital interactive media or games is the storyline; the narrative or quest or goal of the game is primary to both literary works and games. Characters and players go on the quest, and playing the game becomes the narrative.  Game design principles, also relevant in literature and the fine arts, include visual literacy and empowering players/learners to align with great artitsts and writers who believe in the creative process.

The '''Institut für Dokumentologie und Editorik''' (IDE - Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing) is a German association (with the legal status of "[[Eingetragener Verein]]") of researchers working on the application of digital methods to historical documents. Fields of interest include digitization, [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], text encoding, [[textual criticism]], critical scholarly editing, digital [[palaeography]], and digital [[codicology]].

The '''Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities''' ('''IATH''')  is a research unit of the [[University of Virginia]], USA. Its goal is to explore and develop [[information technology]] as a tool for scholarly [[humanities]] research. To that end, IATH provide Fellows with consulting, technical support, applications development, and networked publishing facilities. It cultivates partnerships and participate in humanities computing initiatives with libraries, publishers, information technology companies, scholarly organizations, and other groups residing at the intersection of computers and cultural heritage.

The research projects, essays, and documentation are the products of a collaboration between humanities and computer science research faculty, computer professionals, student assistants and project managers, and library faculty and staff. In many cases, this work is supported by private or federal funding agencies. In all cases, it is supported by the Fellows’ home departments; the College or School to which those departments belong; the University of Virginia Library; the Vice President for Research and Public Service; the Vice President and Chief Information Officer; the Provost; and the President of the University of Virginia.

==History==
The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities was established at the University of Virginia in 1992, with a major grant from IBM and a multi-year commitment of support from the University.

IATH’s founders are in humanities computing, digital scholarship, and academic administration. Beginning in 1992 a steering committee of scholars, including [[Edward Ayers]], [[Alan Batson]], [[Jerome McGann]], [[Kendon Stubbs]] and [[William Wulf]] managed IATH. A search committee commissioned by the steering committee carried out the search for a director of the institute. [[John Unsworth]] was selected, and his term began September 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/new-leader-ever-expanding-university-library-looks-future |title=With New Leader, Ever-Expanding University Library Looks to the Future |work=UVA Today |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |first=Katie |last=McNally |date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATH has generated over $10.7 million in grant funding and gifts in kind since it began operations.  Much of this funding has come from Federal agencies and private foundations, and has gone to support faculty research and teaching across the University.

The '''Institute of Human Origins''' (IHO) is a [[non-profit]], multidisciplinary research organization dedicated to the recovery and analysis of the fossil evidence for [[human evolution]]. It was founded by the team of [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] that discovered [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], and became affiliated with [[Arizona State University]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Institute of Human Origins|url=https://iho.asu.edu/sites/iho-dev.asu.edu/files/iho_newsletter_may_1997.pdf|date=May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, IHO received the single largest grant dedicated to the research of [[Multiregional origin of modern humans|human origins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-09/asu-air091714.php|accessdate=8 April 2016|agency=American Association for the Advancement of Science|title=ASU institute receives single-largest investment in human origins research|publisher=EurekAlert: The Global Source for Science News|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASU institute receives single-largest investment in human origins research|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/asu-institute-receives-single-largest-investment-human-origins-research|website=Arizona State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
After finding [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] during the "surge of discoveries"&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rothman|first1=Lily|title=How Lucy the Australopithecus Changed the Way We Understand Human Evolution|url=http://time.com/4126011/lucy-australopithecus-discovery/|website=Time|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s, [[Donald Johanson]] returned to [[Berkeley, California]] and founded the Institute of Human Origins with the mission of bridging social, earth, and life science approaches to the most important questions concerning the course, causes, and timing of events in the human career over [[deep time]].

==Research and Discoveries==

===The Fossil Record of the Earliest Human Evolution===
[[Ledi-Geraru]] is one of IHO's fieldwork sites in the fossil-rich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Jawbone Could Shake Up Fossil Record|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/070713-ancient-jawbones.html|website=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afar Region]] of Ethiopia. In 2013, graduate student Chalachew Seyoum discovered the lower mandible known as [[LD 350-1]], the oldest fossil from the human genus [[Homo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryn |first1=Brandon |title=Oldest Fossil of Homo Genus Found in Ethiopia |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |website=American Association for the Advancement of Science |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315013228/http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery pushed back evidence of the human genus [[Homo]] to 2.8 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery of 2.8-million-year-old jaw sheds light on early humans Date:|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150304141454.htm|website=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; ago, nearly a half-million years earlier than perviously known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryn |first1=Brandon |title=Oldest Fossil of Homo Genus Found in Ethiopia |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |website=American Association for the Advancement of Science |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315013228/http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing IHO field work in [[Hadar, Ethiopia]], where [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] was found in 1974, addresses the evolution and ecology of [[Australopithecus]] (3.0–3.4 million years ago) and the origin of Homo and stone-tool making (2.3 million years ago). 
In 2007, the field project opened ASU’s Hadar Field School, which educates American study abroad students in field methods in human origins research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadar Paleoanthropology Field School|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kreed/Classes.htm|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Emergence of Modern Humans in Africa===
Since joining IHO in 2001, [[Curtis Marean]] has directed the organization's [[Pinnacle Point]] fieldwork, which is currently working to produce and integrate a climate, environment, and paleoanthropological sequence for the final stage in human evolution. The focus of the Pinnacle Point excavations has been at [[Pinnacle Point|Cave 13B (PP13B)]], where the fieldwork team has discovered early evidence of [[symbolic behavior]]. In 2009, the examination of worked silcrete stone from [[Pinnacle Point]] indicated that it was heat-treated, and is the oldest known example of such technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=K. Kris|title=Pinnacle Point [PP13B] (South Africa)|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/phthroughpi/g/pinnacle_point.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Treatment Makes Better Stone Tools|url=http://www.becominghuman.org/node/news/heat-treatment-makes-better-stone-tools|website=Becoming Human}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinnacle Point also represents the oldest known occurrence of human consumption of [[shellfish]], as well as an early use of [[ochre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marean|first1=Curtis|last2=Bar-Matthews|first2=M|last3=Bernatchez|first3=J|last4=Fisher|first4=E|last5=Goldberg|first5=P|title=Early human use of marine resources and pigment in South Africa during the Middle Pleistocene|journal=Nature|date=2007|volume=449|issue=7164|pages=905-U11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features indicate a sophisticated level of modern behaviors that had previously been associated with Upper Paleolithic of Europe. The discoveries here are key pieces of evidence supporting the early florescence of modern human behaviors in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=K. Kris|title=Pinnacle Point [PP13B] (South Africa)|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/phthroughpi/g/pinnacle_point.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Evolutionary Foundations of Human Uniqueness===
The IHO Templeton Research Program is a collaborative inquiry into the evolutionary foundations of human uniqueness. The $4.9 million, three-year grant from the [[John Templeton Foundation]] is the largest of its type for human origins research, and will support 11 linked investigations of where, when, and how unique human capacities for complex cognition, cumulative culture, and large-scale cooperation emerged.&lt;ref name="IHO Templeton Research Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=IHO Templeton Research Program|url=https://iho.asu.edu/research/iho-templeton-research-program|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion''' ('''IACSR'''), founded in 2006, is a scholarly association dedicated to the promotion of the [[Cognitive Science of Religion]]. The IACSR is an interdisciplinary association, including scholars from a wide variety of disciplines in the human, social, natural and health sciences that are interested in the academic, scientific study of religious phenomena. The IACSR seeks to advance the naturalistic study of religion. It is strictly scientific and does not encourage or welcome those who are interested in dialogue between science and religion, attempt to find religion in science and science in religion, or attempt to validate religious or spiritual doctrines through cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;[[IACSR]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.iacsr.com/Home.html |title=IACSR-Home |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IACSR supports the ''Electronic Archive for Religion &amp; Cognition'' at the ''Centre for Religion &amp; Cognition'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religionandcognition.com/crc/|title=Centre for Religion &amp; Cognition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.religionandcognition.com/crc|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groningen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csr-arc.com|title=Archive for Religion &amp; Cognition|date=|website=www.csr-arc.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Journal of Cognition &amp; Culture'' ([[Brill Publishers]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brill.nl/jocc|title=Journal of Cognition and Culture {{!}} Brill|website=www.brill.nl|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two book series, ''Scientific Studies of Religion: Inquiry and Explanation'' ([http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/series/scientific-studies-of-religion-inquiry-and-explanation/ Bloomsbury Academic]), which was formerly the series ''Cognitive Science of Religion'' ([[AltaMira Press]]), and ''Religion, Cognition and Culture'' (Equinox Press).

'''Mediated quasi-interaction''' is a concept in [[communication science]] that describes a monological interaction between people, which is oriented towards an indefinite range of potential recipients.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson,1995&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a fundamental asymmetry between producers and receivers.&lt;ref name="DavidHesmondhalgh"&gt;David Hesmondhalgh,2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Mediated Quasi-Interaction are television, radio and newspapers and other forms of mass media.

== History ==

The concept was developed by sociologist [[John Brookshire Thompson]], a professor at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]]. The concept is first documented in his book “The Rise of Mediated Interaction”, which was published in 1995 in Cambridge, UK. Thompson developed a [[conceptual framework]] for the analysis of the forms of action and interaction created by the media. He wanted to focus the types of interactional situation created by the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; He also wanted the analytical framework to examine some of the interactional features of the social relationships established by the media.&lt;ref name="Thompson_a"&gt;Thompson 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

He created the concept in part of his theory of interaction. The 3 steps theory consisted of Face-to-Face interaction, Mediated Interaction and Mediated Quasi-Interaction. Face-to- people share time and space, since they are co-present and mediated interaction the sending of the message and its reception are separated in time and space.&lt;ref name="Wouters"&gt;Wouters,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson, 1995, Table 3.1

== Basic premises and approach ==

Mediated Quasi-interaction is monologicial in character and involves the production of symbolic forms for an indefinite range of potential recipients. Mediated Quasi-Interaction creates a certain kind of social situation in which individuals are linked together in a process of communication and symbolic exchange. It is a structured situation in which some individuals are engaged primarily in producing symbolic forms for others who are not physically present, while others are involved primarily in receiving symbolic forms produced to whom they cannot respond, but with whom they can form bonds of friendship, affection or loyalty.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Mediated quasi-interaction is based on social relations established by media of mass communications.&lt;ref name="TerhiRantanen"&gt;Terhi Rantanen,2005&lt;/ref&gt; With mass media being impossible to be genuine interactivity, Mediated quasi-interaction is simulated interaction. It is typical for the mass media to try to simulate [[interpersonal communication]] and to personalize their communication (ex. Call-ins).&lt;ref name="PekkaIsotalus"&gt;Pekka Isotalus,1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another focus of Mediated Quasi-Interaction is also on its space-time constitution. It is described as a separation of contexts with extended availability in time and space.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Mediated Quasi-Interaction can also be combined with other interaction such as [[dyadic communication|face-to-face]]. For example, people can sit in a room together and have a discussion while they are watching television. In a similar relation, a television program may involve face to face interaction with a panel and an audience, although the program remains primarily a form Mediated Quasi-Interaction.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

'''''Ostforschung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔɔstˌfɔʁʃʊŋ|lang}}, "research on the east") is a [[German language|German]] term dating from the 18th century for the study of the areas to the east of [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|the core German-speaking region]].

Traditional ''Ostforschung'' has fallen into disrepute with modern German historians as it often reflected Western European [[Anti-Polish sentiment|prejudices of the time]] towards [[Poles]].&lt;ref name=Karin&gt;{{cite book |first=Karin |last=Friedrich |date=2006 |title=The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=5, 13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpulHjDt8UEC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''Ostforschung'' itself remained in use in the names of some journals and institutes throughout the [[Cold War]], but was replaced by more specific terms by the 1990s (e.g., the journal ''Zeitschrift für Ostforschung'', established in 1952, was renamed ''[[Zeitschrift für Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung]]'' in 1994).

Since the 1990s, ''Ostforschung'' itself has become a subject of historical research.

''Ostforschung'' was also the name of a multidisciplinary organization set up before [[World War II]] by Nazi German chief propagandist [[Albert Brackmann]] supporting Nazi genocidal policies, ethnic cleansing and anti-semitism. Brackmann and several other Nazi and nationalist historians and anthropologists co-ordinated Nazi German research on [[Eastern Europe]], mainly the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The research conducted by this organisation, as well as the [[Ahnenerbe]], was instrumental in planning of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] of local non-German populations in [[Generalplan Ost]].

'''Out-of-Home Entertainment''' (also '''OOHE''' or '''OHE''') is a term coined by the amusement industry to collectively refer to experiences at regional attractions like theme parks and waterparks with their thrill rides and slides, and smaller community-based entertainment venues such as family entertainment and cultural venues.

In the US alone, there are nearly 30,000 attractions&amp;mdash;theme and amusement parks, attractions, water parks, family entertainment centers, zoos, aquariums, science centers, museums, and resorts, producing a total nationwide economic impact of $219 billion in 2011, according to leading international industry association, [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] (IAAPA). The industry directly employs more than 1.3 million and indirectly generates 1 million jobs in the US, creating a total job impact of 2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaapa.org/resources/by-park-type/amusement-parks-and-attractions/industry-statistics|title=Amusement Park and Attractions Industry Statistics|website=www.iaapa.org|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the use of this term has gained acceptance with and been popularized by amusement industry players, industry associations, trade magazines and even securities analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4062446-investors-play-dave-and-busters|title=Investors Should Play At Dave &amp; Buster's|last=Berner|first=Mike|date=2017-04-14|work=Seeking Alpha|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stems from the desire to distinguish between the social, competitive atmosphere and dedicated hardware found in location-based entertainment venues from at-home consumer-game entertainment, [[mobile entertainment]] or even [[Augmented reality|augmented reality (AR)]] and [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]].  The reality is that the lines are increasingly blurred with today's sophisticated consumers and emerging technologies.

This term is not to be confused with [[Out-of-home advertising|out-of-home media advertising]] as used by the advertising industry, although the convergence of digital out-of-home advertising and the digital out-of-home entertainment is producing innovations in retail and hospitality, steeped in fundamentals of social gaming experiences defined by the video amusement industry during the 70’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/damian-bazadona/a-new-way-to-view-social-_b_14691878.html|title=A New Way To View Social Gaming|last=Bazadona|first=Damian|date=2017-02-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{See also|History of video games}}
Digital out-of-home entertainment (also '''DOE''') is a sector that is understood by few but is a fast-growing technology sector with plenty of innovations transforming the sector.  Its roots lie in the popularity of [[coin-op]]erated [[arcade video game]]s such as racing, fighting, Japanese imports, or pinball that [[Generation X]] will vividly recall with fond memories of countless hours of their youth spent in dimly-lit video-game rooms (popularly known as 'arcades').

When [[Generation Y]] came along, an audience well-versed in digital gaming favored game consoles over arcade machines.  So while video amusement remains an integral part of the [[popular culture]] fabric today, its relevancy is diminished and even perceived as 'dead' partly due to the lack of coverage by consumer-game media even as the amusement industry transformed itself and research and development investments continue to pour into the sector, evolving and growing the out-of-home, pay-to-play experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=1h6rBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=out+of+home+entertainment+dave+and+busters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcQoiWIrrM&amp;sig=MLxxfXmIfOk5I26_Xv8xrGA9rck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihyIaCh_DYAhXBs48KHejvC-EQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=out%20of%20home%20entertainment%20dave%20and%20busters&amp;f=false|title=The Out-of-Home Immersive Entertainment Frontier: Expanding Interactive Boundaries in Leisure Facilities|last=Williams|first=Kevin|last2=Mascioni|first2=Michael|date=2014-06-27|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781472426956|edition= 1st|location=|pages=5|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the non-profit Digital Out-of-Home Interactive Entertainment Network Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dna-association.com/|title=DNA Association Website — Digital Out-of-home Interactive Entertainment Network Association|website=www.dna-association.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to help "define these amorphous groups that comprise this vibrant industry and illustrate how they all interact" with groups spanning from "[[family entertainment center]]s (FEC), location-based entertainment sites, visitor attractions, theme parks as well as retail, shopping malls and the hospitality sector – and not forgetting museums, heritage sites, schools".

== Key Actors in Out-of-Home Entertainment ==
=== Family Entertainment Centers ===
{{See also|family entertainment center}}The traditional [[Family entertainment center|FECs]] is a classic form of OOHE that is easily understood by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/familyctr.shtml|title=Family Entertainment Centers|website=www.whitehutchinson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s and the winning formula of combining food and entertainment as a business model has been around for more than 30 years.  The first [[Dave &amp; Buster's]] was opened in 1982 in [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas]], [[Texas]] after discovering this winning formula and is a highly-successful FEC chain today with their "Eat, Drink, Play, Watch" offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/articles/thatseatertainment.shtml|title=That's Eatertainment! Everything you need to know about combining entertainment and food service to build profit and repeat business|website=www.whitehutchinson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck E. Cheese's|Chuck E. Cheese]] first opened a store in 1977 and became the public embodiment of the typical children's party room combined with a pizza restaurant and arcade.  Other restaurants started to come round to seeing the importance of amusement games and "anchor" attractions ([[bowling alley]]s, [[miniature golf]], [[laser tag]]s, [[batting cage]]s, [[Roller rink|roller skating rinks]], etc.) to encourage dwell time of 1–2 hours and stimulating repeat visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=1h6rBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=out+of+home+entertainment+dave+and+busters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcQoiWIrrM&amp;sig=MLxxfXmIfOk5I26_Xv8xrGA9rck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihyIaCh_DYAhXBs48KHejvC-EQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=out%20of%20home%20entertainment%20dave%20and%20busters&amp;f=false|title=The Out-of-Home Immersive Entertainment Frontier: Expanding Interactive Boundaries in Leisure Facilities|last=Williams|first=Mr Kevin|last2=Mascioni|first2=Mr Michael|date=2014-06-28|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472426956|location=|pages=66|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arcade Video Game Developers ===
{{See also|Arcade game|Timeline of arcade video game history}}Probably known more by the [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] arcade video game titles they produced rather than by company names, these video game developers played a defining role in the birth of the video amusement industry. In 1972, [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]] essentially created the first commercially successful video game ''[[Pong]],'' marking the beginning of the coin-operated [[video game industry]].  In 1978, the first blockbuster arcade video game, ''[[Space Invaders]]'' was produced by [[Taito|Taito Corporation]] and ushered in the [[golden age of arcade video games]]. [[Namco]] (of [[Pac-Man|''Pac-Man''']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s fame), [[Nintendo]] ([[Donkey Kong (video game)|''Donkey Kong'']]), [[Konami]] ([[Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue|''Frogger'']]), [[Capcom]] ([[Street Fighter|''Street Fighters'']]), [[Sega AM2]] (''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona]]'') are among some of the most notable video game developers that remain active today in the video amusement scene.

[[Video game publisher]]s are also making inroads into the OOHE market by licensing iconic IPs ([[intellectual property]]) to experienced arcade game developers and manufacturers, such as the recent collaboration between [[Ubisoft]] and LAI Games to produce ''Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride'', an attendant-free VR attraction based on the popular ''[[Rabbids]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.replaymag.com/lai-december-2017/|title=LAI Virtual Rabbids – December 2017 {{!}} RePlay Magazine|website=www.replaymag.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2017/11/ubisofts-rabbids-are-back-in-vr-with-virtual-rabbids-the-big-ride/|title=Ubisoft’s Rabbids Are Back In VR With Virtual Rabbids – The Big Ride|work=VRFocus|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blooloop.com/features/ubisoft-vr-rabbids-maze-lbe/|title=Ubisoft - Rabbids and Assassins Creed VR target new LBE audiences {{!}} blooloop|work=Blooloop|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redemption Game Manufacturers ===
{{See also|Redemption game}}A redemption game is an arcade amusement game involving skill that rewards the player (in gifts, tokens, etc.) proportionately to his or her score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/redemption-game|title=Redemption-game dictionary definition {{!}} redemption-game defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Merchandiser|Merchandizers]] also fall in the redemption game category.)  One of the most popular redemption games, [[Skee-Ball|''Skee Ball'']], has more than 100,000 Skee-Ball branded alley games in use worldwide by some estimates and continue to endure after more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/why-skee-ball-doesnt-change/509117/|title=Why Skee-Ball Doesn't Change|last=Klin|first=Richard|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, BayTek Games (known for their hit game ''Big Bass Wheel'') bought the rights to ''Skee-Ball'' from Skee-Ball Amusement Games, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vendingtimes.com/articles/bay-tek-acquires-skeeball-the-worlds-oldest-and-re-1344?iid=24D69C2C3ECE4F6C8AA75ED13523F6EE|title=Bay Tek Acquires Skee-Ball, The World's Oldest And Renowned Arcade Alley Game Brand  {{!}} Articles {{!}} Vending Times|website=www.vendingtimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Innovative Concepts in Entertainment (ICE), another reputable manufacturer, produced hit [[midway (fair)|midway]]-style redemption games such as ''Down The Clown'' and ''Gold Fishin''.  LAI Games (formerly part of the Leisure and Allied Industries Group which founded [[Timezone (video arcades)|Timezone]]) produced hit games such as [[Stacker (game)|''Stacker'']] and ''Speed of Light,'' the latter in which was embedded in popular culture with its appearance in [[Nickelodeon]] TV show [[Game Shakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intergameonline.com/coin-op/news/lai-games-debuts-on-nickelodeon|title=LAI Games debuts on Nickelodeon|last=|first=|date=2015-11-10|work=InterGame: iGaming, Casino &amp; Coin-Op News|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable players include Apple Industries, Inc., Coastal Amusements, Universal Space (UNIS), Adrenaline Amusements.

=== Simulator Video Game Manufacturers ===
{{See also|Simulation video game}}Another category of video amusement games are simulators. [[Raw Thrills]], best known for developing arcade video games based on films such as ''[[Jurassic Park Arcade]]'' and ''[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The]]'' [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|''Walking Dead'']] ''Arcade'', is a common name found in medium and larger-sized FECs.  Other established companies in this category are Triotech, maker of [[Typhoon (simulator)|''Typhoon'']] - a 3D arcade machine with 2 seats and delivers up to 2G Forces of acceleration, and [[CJ Group|CJ 4DPLEX]] with their ''Mini Rider 3D'' - a 2-seat simulator on an electric motion base with a choice of several 3D movies.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] provides an overview of and topical guide to entertainment and the entertainment industry:

'''[[Entertainment]]''' is any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to [[amusement|amuse]] themselves in their [[leisure|leisure time]], and may also provide [[fun]], enjoyment, and laughter. People may create their own entertainment, such as when they spontaneously invent a  game; participate actively in an activity they find entertaining, such as when they play [[sport]] as a hobby; or consume an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a performance.

The '''[[Show business|entertainment industry]]''' (informally known as '''show business''' or '''show biz''') is part of the [[tertiary sector of the economy]] and includes a large number of sub-industries devoted to [[entertainment]]. However, the term is often used in the [[mass media]] to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment. In the popular parlance, the term ''show biz'' in particular connotes the commercially popular performing arts, especially [[musical theatre]], [[vaudeville]], [[comedy]], [[film]], and [[music]].  It applies to every aspect of entertainment including [[film|cinema]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[theatre]], and [[music]].

== Debate and public attention ==

=== Support ===

In a 1996 article "Abortion and Fathers' Rights,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven D. Hales|authorlink1=Abortion and Fathers' Rights|editor1-last=Humber|editor1-first=James|title=REPRODUCTION, TECHNOLOGY, AND RIGHTS|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC|isbn=978-1-4757-6403-1|pages=5–26|format=Biomedical Ethics Reviews|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher Steven Hales made an argument that presupposes the following assertions:

# That women have an absolute right to abortion on demand;
# That men and women have equal moral rights and duties and should have equal legal right and duties; and
# That parents have a moral duty to support their children once they are born and legal duties of support should supervene on this moral duty.

Hales contends that the conjunction of these three principles is prima facie inconsistent and that this inconsistency should be eradicated by firstly acknowledging that men have no absolute duty to provide material support for their children, and secondly by admitting that fathers have the right of refusal.

[[Laurie Shrage]], professor of philosophy and women’s and gender studies, questions whether men should be 'penalized for being sexually active', and she puts the subject in the perspective of feminists who had to fight the same idea with different gender portent, namely that consenting to sexual intercourse is not the same as consenting to parenthood. Furthermore, both men and children are punished, according to professor Shrage; children have to live with an absent father who never 'voluntarily' became a parent.&lt;ref name=AnneSophia2016-01-30/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrage 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shrage | first=Laurie | title=Is Forced Fatherhood Fair? | website=Opinionator | date=2013-06-12 | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/is-forced-fatherhood-fair/ | accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Paper abortion has met opposition by those who see it as an excuse for men to shirk their responsibilities as a father.&lt;ref name=PolitkenA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/profiler/bob/ECE2182043/aldrig-har-maend-udstillet-sig-selv-mere-kaellingeagtigt/|title=Aldrig har mænd udstillet sig selv mere kællingeagtigt|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Never have men exhibited themselves more hag-like }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gudme (2016)"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gudme |first1=Maria |last2=Dyrkjær |first2=Maja Vedel |title=Fædre skal tage ansvar for børn - ikke kræve juridisk abort |trans-title=Fathers must take responsibility for children - does not require legal abortion |language=Danish |date=2016-02-04 |newspaper=[[Politiken]] |department=Debate |url=http://politiken.dk/debat/ECE3050409/faedre-skal-tage-ansvar-for-boern---ikke-kraeve-juridisk-abort/ |access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that men should use birth control (either contraception or sterilization) or practice abstinence if they want to avoid the financial and personal responsibilities of fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/fomo/ECE3050063/stor-guide-saadan-undgaar-du-at-blive-far/|title=Stor guide: Sådan undgår du at blive far|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Great guide: How to avoid becoming a father }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/klummer/amaliekestler/ECE3067223/skyl-juridisk-abort-ud-med-badevandet/|title=Skyl 'juridisk abort' ud med badevandet|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Rinse 'legal abortion' out with the bathwater }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also argue that a father's paper abortion is different from a female abortion since a child is born. Thus the best interests of the child should weigh more than equal opportunity to deny parenthood.{{r|Gudme (2016)}}

== In Scandinavia ==

=== Denmark ===
The concept of a paper abortion was first introduced in Denmark in 2000 by the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomicist]] Henrik Platz. He says that it is necessary from an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] perspective, to ensure that women and men have equal rights under the law. According to a Gallup poll from 2014 and earlier polls, between 40% and 70% of Danes agree with legalizing paper abortion.&lt;ref name=nyheder2016-03-13/&gt;

Sociologist Karen Sjørup, who conducted research on the topic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sjørup|first1=Karen|title=Men´s right to paper abortion – a feminist perspective|url=http://interactingminds.au.dk/events/single-events/artikel/gendering-in-research-talk-by-karen-sjoerup-ruc/|website=Interacting Minds Centre|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that it would give women more freedom by allowing those who want to become mothers without having to share the rights and duties of parenthood with men an additional way to do so. She also suggests that it could decrease the abortion rate because it would prevent men who wished to avoid fatherhood from pressuring women to abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.information.dk/moti/2016/02/juridisk-abort-god-ting-ogsaa-kvinderne|title=Juridisk abort er en god ting – også for kvinderne|website=Information|language=Danish|access-date=2016-03-14|trans-title=Juridical abortion is a good thing - even for women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that just as women are able to choose whether to have a child or not, men should also be able to choose whether to assume paternity or not. Allowing men to have the opportunity to renounce the economic, social and legal responsibility for an unborn child during the first three months of pregnancy would give men and women as close to equal opportunities as possible.&lt;ref name=AnneSophia2016-01-30&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annesophia.blogs.berlingske.dk/2016/01/30/skal-maend-have-fri-abort/|title= Skal mænd have fri abort?|website=ASH|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Should men be free to abort? | author = Anne Sophia Hermansen | date = 2016-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
In 2016, a regional branch of the Swedish Liberal Youth Party decided to support paper abortion for men until the 18th week of pregnancy, the time limit on abortions for women. The proposition was supported by some commentators, but not by the LYP's parent party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Patriarchy''''' is a 2007 book by [[V. Geetha]], an academic activist and author on the subject of [[patriarchy]] in [[India]]. The book, written from the female perspective, is part of the "Theorizing Feminism" series published by Stree (an imprint of [[Bhatkal and Sen]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/patriarchy-through-the-feminist-lens/article1446078.ece|title = Patriarchy Through the Feminist Lens|last = Swaminathan|first = Padmini|date = 2 January 2008|work = The Hindu|access-date = 22 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three editions have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/patriarchy/oclc/154204766/editions?editionsView=true&amp;referer=br|title = Patriarchy listing on WorldCat|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2015|website = WorldCat|publisher = OCLC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In India, [[patriarchy]] disrupts women's lives. According to Geetha,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.saarthakindia.org/womens_situation_India.html|title = Women's Situation in India|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2015|website = Saarthak|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sexual violence has been blamed on a patriarchal backlash where the term 'patriarchy' is often synonymous with 'tradition{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/17/sexual-violence-india-patriarchal-narendra-modi-women-reform-rape|title = Sexual Violence in India is a Patriarchal Backlash That Must Be Stopped|last = Virmani|first = Priya|date = 17 June 2014|work = The Guardian|access-date = 22 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminism]] has a long tradition of examining the concept of patriarchy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://isj.org.uk/theories-of-patriarchy/|title = Theories of Patriarchy|last = German|first = Lindsey|date = 1981|journal = International Socialism|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 22 August 2015|issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book attempts to demonstrate that the nature, effect, and meanings of male authority and power can only be understood through the idea of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Patriarchy'' introduces readers to [[concept]]s in [[feminist theory]] involving [[patriarchy]]. According to Geetha, "The book does not propound a theory of patriarchy; rather, it points to those areas of reality and traditions of knowledge that we might need to draw upon to define patriarchy. It indicates the need for theory-making, and shows how this may be done. Its intent is fundamentally [[pedagogical]] and is a beginners' text to help the reader consider patriarchy in all its aspects".&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

She describes how knowledge about patriarchy cannot be easily separated from the feminist desire to generate such knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 4- 61&lt;/ref&gt; "By understanding patriarchy, the notions of production and reproduction are important concepts". Geetha highlights unique aspects of [[Culture of India|Indian society]], such as kinship structures and the [[caste system]],&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 61-131&lt;/ref&gt; to better understand patriarchy. According to the author, "A woman's identity as a citizen and rights to equality are undercut by the fact of their gender".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Geetha theorizes that patriarchal power "is not merely coercive ... Cultural and sexual [[norm (social)|norm]]s constitute the everyday exercise of patriarchal power".&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 131- 203&lt;/ref&gt; She also writes, "Sexuality is a crucial link between [[caste]] and gender, so that [[marriage]] and sexual rules are not only set by caste, but also the notions of right pleasure are defined by it."&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3705692 | pmid=23858264 | doi=10.4103/0019-5545.105547 | volume=55 | title=Indian religious concepts on sexuality and marriage | year=2013 | journal=Indian J Psychiatry | pages=S256–62 | last1 = Mahajan | first1 = PT | last2 = Pimple | first2 = P | last3 = Palsetia | first3 = D | last4 = Dave | first4 = N | last5 = De Sousa | first5 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Queer Crips: Disabled Gay Men and Their Stories''''' is a 2004 anthology edited by Bob Guter and John R. Killacky. The book is a  collection of personal stories from gay men with disabilities. The stories are told through a variety of literary genres, including poetry, prose, and interviews. The book won the [[2004 Lambda Literary Awards|2004 Lambda Literary Award]] for the Anthologies/Non-fiction category. Contributors to the book include gay men such as [[Greg Walloch]], [[Kenny Fries]], [[J. Quinn Brisben]], and [[Eli Clare]]. After being turned down for publication by 30 publishers, the anthology was finally published by Harrington Park Press, an imprint of [[Haworth Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Gay-disabled-and-with-a-lot-to-talk-about-2788997.php |title=Gay, disabled and with a lot to talk about |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01 |first=Heidi |last=Benson |date=2004-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Disability Studies Quarterly'', the publication of the [[Society for Disability Studies]], wrote a review of ''Queer Crips'', stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Queer Crips can definitely boast of well-crafted, gorgeous poetry, there are a few exceptions. Perhaps it is only a matter of taste, but some of the poetry is of the cathartic type without the "craft" elements of formal published poetry or the spectacle of a performance piece. However, what is great about including such poetry is that it elevates all expressions of feeling and, in a sense, truly captures the sharing of the soul that poetry is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/518/695 |title=BOOK &amp; FILM REVIEWS |publisher=''[[Society for Disability Studies|Disability Studies Quarterly]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the book ''Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability'', [[Robert McRuer]] notes that the stories in ''Queer Crips'' are "nonheteronormative in their broadest sense" and that it is "striking how much the convergence of disability and homosexuality in "Queer Crips" appears to authorize erotic inventiveness and play". McRuer further writes that the anthology implicitly draws a parallel between [[compulsory heterosexuality]] and "compulsory able-bodiedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last= McRuer|first= Robert|authorlink= |year= 2006|publisher= [[New York University Press]]|location= [[New York City]]|isbn= 0-814-75712-X|page= |pages= 243–4|accessdate=October 1, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdNb_XJrPwwC&amp;pg=PA243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Queer theory''' is a field of [[critical theory]] that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of [[queer studies]] and [[women's studies]]. Queer theory includes both [[queer]] readings of texts and the theorization of 'queerness' itself.  Heavily influenced by the work of [[Lauren Berlant]], [[Leo Bersani]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Lee Edelman]], [[Jack Halberstam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], queer theory builds both upon [[feminist]] challenges to the idea that [[gender]] is part of the [[Essentialism|essential]] self and upon [[gay]]/[[lesbian]] studies' close examination of the [[socially constructed]] nature of [[sexual acts]] and [[Sexual identity|identities]]. Whereas gay/lesbian studies focused its inquiries into natural and unnatural behavior with respect to homosexual behavior, queer theory expands its focus to encompass any kind of sexual activity or identity that falls into [[Normality (behavior)|normative]] and [[deviant]] categories. [[Italian feminist]] and [[film theorist]] [[Teresa de Lauretis]] coined the term ''queer theory'' for a conference she organized at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1990 and a special issue of ''Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'' she edited based on that conference.
 
Through the context of heterosexuality being the origin and foundation of society's heteronormative stability, the concept of queerness focuses on, "mismatches between sex, gender and desire"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Queerness has been associated most prominently with [[bisexual]], lesbian and gay subjects, but its [[analytic framework]] also includes such topics as [[cross-dressing]], [[intersex]] bodies and identities, [[gender ambiguity]] and [[gender-corrective surgery]]. Queer theory holds that individual [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] is a fluid, fragmented, and dynamic collectivity of possible sexualities and it may vary at different points of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Theory Today: A User-friendly Guide|last=Tyson|first=Lois|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0415974097|location=New York|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its attempted debunking of stable (and correlated) sexes, genders, and sexualities develops out of the specifically lesbian and gay reworking of the post-structuralist figuring of identity as a constellation of multiple and unstable positions.

Queer theory also examines the discourses of homosexuality developed in the last century in order to place the "queer" into historical context, [[deconstructing]] contemporary arguments both for and against this latest terminology.

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Queer theory is derived largely from [[post-structuralist]] [[theory]], and deconstruction in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Law and Society: American and Global Perspectives|last=Clark|first=David|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780761923879|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=1256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Contemporary Religion and Sexuality|last=Hunt|first=Stephen|last2=Yip|first2=Andrew|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409409496|location=Oxon|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1970s, a range of authors brought deconstructionist critical approaches to bear on issues of sexual identity, and especially on the construction of [[Heteronormativity]], i.e. the normalizing practices and institutions that [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] heterosexuality as fundamental in [[society]] and in turn [[Sexual orientation discrimination|discriminates]] those outside this [[system of power|stem of power]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and focused to a large degree on non-heteronormative sexualities and sexual practices. In "The Politics of Inside/Out" Fuss asserts that the concept of “coming out” and being visible has been normalized while simultaneously contributing to the disappearance of queerness. By declaring oneself to be visible and “out” declares the ones who are not invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namaste|first=Ki|date=1994|title=The Politics of Inside/Out: Queer Theory, Poststructuralism, and a Sociological Approach to Sexuality|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=fff70ba9-67d4-4981-8ccf-7dbf8e0fdb3a%40pdc-v-sessmgr06|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=12|pages=220|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was also influenced by the political agency, particularly the Anglo-American cultures in the HIV/AIDS activism of the 1980s and contemporary feminism in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Queer Theory's overarching goal is to be sought out as a lens or tool to deconstruct the existing monolithic [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] of [[social norms]] and [[Folk taxonomy|taxonomies]]; as well as, how these [[Norm (social)|norms]] came into being and why.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual Deviance and Society: A sociological examination|last=Worthen|first=Meredith|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138819061|location=Oxon|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view is that these notions and norms are rigid organizing categories that do not sufficiently explain different attitudes, behaviors, or conditions of individual experiences. In addition, it analyzes the correlation between power distribution and identification while understanding the [[Wiktionary:multifarious|multifarious]] facets of [[oppression]] and privilege. [[Feminist theory|Feminist]] and Queer Theory are seen as applicable concepts that provide a framework to explore these issues rather than as an identity to those in the [[community]]. Queer is an [[umbrella term]] for those not only deemed sexually deviant, but also used to describe those who feel [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] as a result of standard [[social practices]]. It is a “site of permanent becoming” (Giffney, 2004).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1177/1464700104040814|title= Denormatizing Queer Theory: More Than (Simply) Lesbian and Gay Studies|journal= Feminist Theory|volume= 5|pages= 73–78|year= 2004|last1= Giffney|first1= Noreen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''queer theory'' was introduced in 1990, with [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], Judith Butler, [[Adrienne Rich]] and Diana Fuss (all largely following the work of [[Michel Foucault]]) being among its foundational proponents.

[[Annamarie Jagose]] wrote ''Queer Theory: An Introduction'' in 1996.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jagose|first1=Annamarie|title=Queer theory an introduction|date=1996|publisher=New York Univ. Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814742341|edition=Reprint.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/queer-theory-an-introduction/oclc/35651102&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer used to be a [[slang]] word for homosexuals and was used for [[homophobic abuse]]. Recently, this term has been used as an umbrella term for a coalition of sexual identities that are culturally marginalized, and at other times, to create discourse surrounding the budding [[theoretical model]] that primarily arose through more traditional lesbian and gay studies. According to Jagose (1996), "Queer focuses on mismatches between sex, gender and desire. For most, queer has been prominently associated with those who identify as lesbian and gay. Unknown to many, queer is in association with more than just gay and lesbian, but also cross-dressing, [[hermaphroditism]], gender ambiguity and gender-corrective surgery."

In addition, it is important to understand that Queer Theory is not predominantly about analyzing the binary of the homosexual and heterosexual. There is an abundance of identities in which Queer Theory not only recognizes but also breaks down in relation to other contributing factors like [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[Social class|class]], [[religion]], etc.

"Queer is a product of specific [[cultural]] and theoretical pressures which increasingly structured debates (both within and outside the academy) about questions of lesbian and gay identity,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but now, with the evolution of language, it is important to understand that the terms ‘gay’ and ‘lesbian’ are static, [[Eurocentric]] labels that fail to be universal when looking at a transnational scale. It is merely reductive to view Queer Theory as a byname for Gay and Lesbian studies when the two fields have stark differences.{{quote box|align=center|width=50%|quote=Queer is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant. There is nothing in particular to 
which it necessarily refers. It is an identity without an essence. 'Queer' then, demarcates not a positivity but
a positionality vis-à-vis the normative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The future of queer theory is rooted in the aspiration of the term being utilized to reference and question all deviations from normative, as well as serve as a foundation of interrogation of the normative. The desires that queer theory is centered in do not reference sexuality, however because the foundation of queer theory lies in the assessment and analysis of what is deemed normative and non-normative, sexuality intersects with the components that maintain the fundamentals of queer theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Queer theorist [[Michael Warner]] attempts to provide a solid definition of a concept that typically circumvents categorical definitions: "Social reflection carried out in such a manner tends to be creative, fragmentary, and defensive, and leaves us perpetually at a disadvantage. And it is easy to be misled by the [[utopian]] claims advanced in support of particular tactics. But the range and seriousness of the problems that are continually raised by queer practice indicate how much work remains to be done. Because the logic of the sexual order is so deeply embedded by now in an indescribably wide range of social institutions, and is embedded in the most standard accounts of the world, queer struggles aim not just at toleration or equal status but at challenging those institutions and accounts. Similarly, queer theorist [[Cathy J. Cohen|Cathy Cohen]] highlights the limitations of a queer politics that attempts integration into “dominant institutions and normative social relationships” in order to centralize [[LGBTQ]] identity, and rather that it is necessary to affect the [[societal values]] and legislations that result in these oppressive institutions and relationships of power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dawning realization that themes of [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]] may be read in almost any document of our culture means that we are only beginning to have an idea of how widespread those institutions and accounts are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ed|first1=Michael Warner|title=Fear of a queer planet queer politics and social theory|date=1997|publisher=Univ. of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0816623341|edition=3. pr.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/fear-of-a-queer-planet-queer-politics-and-social-theory/oclc/28634756&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theory explores and contests the categorization of gender and [[sexuality]]. If identities are not fixed, they cannot be categorized and labeled, because identities consist of many varied components, so categorization by one characteristic is incomplete, and there is an interval between what a subject "does" ([[Role-taking theory|role-taking]]) and what a subject "is" (the [[self]]). This opposition destabilizes identity categories, which are designed to identify the "sexed subject" and place individuals within a single restrictive [[sexual orientation]].

==History==
"Queer" marks both a continuity and a break with the notion of gayness emerging from [[gay liberationist]] and [[lesbian feminist]] models, such as [[Adrienne Rich]]'s ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. "Gay" vs. "queer" fueled debates (both within and outside of academia) about LGBT identity. The independence of "queer" from "gay" came from the alignment of gay ideals with assimilationism and conservatism, while queer coincided with a radical approach. Assimilationists saw being nothing wrong with society; queer radicalism aspires to achieve nothing in reference to the status quo because societal acceptance is not essential because society is unacceptable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kemp|first1=Jonathan|title=Queer Past, Queer Present, Queer Future|journal=Graduate Journal of Social Science|date=2009|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://gjss.org/sites/default/files/issues/chapters/papers/Journal-06-01--01-Kemp.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matos|first1=Angel Daniel|title=Gay Assimilationists versus Radical Queers: The Death of Queerness?|url=http://angelmatos.net/2013/04/06/gay-assimilationists-versus-radical-queers-the-death-of-queerness/|website=The Ever and Ever That Fiction Allows|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a long history of [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[anarchistic]] thinking about sexual and gender relations across many cultures. [[Josiah Flynt]] became one of the first [[sociologists]] to study homosexuality. Most recently, in the late 1970s and 1980s, [[social constructionists]] conceived of the sexual subject as a culturally dependent, historically specific product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubin|first1=Gayle S.|title=Deviations : a Gayle Rubin reader|date=2011|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0-8223-4971-6|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/deviations-a-gayle-rubin-reader/oclc/777134989&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the phrase "queer theory" was born, the term "Queer Nation" appeared on the cover of the short-lived lesbian/gay quarterly [[Outlook (magazine)|''Outlook'']] in the winter 1991 issues. Writers Allan Berube and Jeffrey Escoffier drove home the point that Queer Nation strove to embrace paradoxes in its [[political activism]], and that the activism was taking new form and revolving around the issue of identity.&lt;ref name="A genealogy of queer theory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=William B.|title=A genealogy of queer theory|date=2000|publisher=Temple Univ.

There were a number of significant outbursts of lesbian/gay political/[[LGBT culture|cultural]] activity. Out of this emerged queer theory. Their work however did not arise out of the blue. [[Teresa de Lauretis]] is credited with coining the phrase "queer theory". It was at a working conference on lesbian and gay sexualities that was held at the [[University of California]], [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] in February 1990 that de Lauretis first made mention of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;David Halperin. "The Normalization of Queer Theory." ''Journal of Homosexuality'', v.45, pp. 339–343&lt;/ref&gt; She later introduced the phrase in a 1991 special issue of [[Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies|''difference''s'': A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'']], entitled "Queer Theory: Lesbian and Gay Sexualities." Similar to the description Berube and Escoffier used for Queer Nation, de Lauretis asserted that, "queer unsettles and questions the genderedness of sexuality."&lt;ref name=education&gt;{{Citation|last=Pinar|first=William F.|title=Queer Theory in Education|year=1998|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Mahwah|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barely three years later, she abandoned the phrase « on the grounds that it had been taken over by those mainstream forces and institutions it was coined to resist ».&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A 1996, "Queer Theory".&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler's ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]]'s ''[[Epistemology of the Closet]]'', and [[David Halperin]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]'' inspired other works. Teresa de Lauretis, Judith Butler, and Eve Sedgwick arranged much of the conceptual base for the emerging field in the 1990s. Along with other queer theorists, these three outlined a political [[hermeneutics]], which emphasized representation. These scholars questioned whether people of varying sexual orientations had the same political goals, and whether those in the [[sexual minority]] felt that they could be represented along with others of different sexualities and orientations. "While some critics insist that queer theory is apolitical word-smithery, de Lauretis, Butler, and Sedgwick take seriously the role that signs and symbols play in shaping the meanings and possibilities of our culture at the most basic level, including politics conventionally defined."&lt;ref name="A genealogy of queer theory"/&gt;

Queer theory has increasingly been applied not just to contemporary sexualities and identities but also to practices and identities in earlier time periods. Examination of [[LGBT history#The Renaissance|Renaissance]] culture and [[Renaissance literature|literature]], for example, has generated significant scholarship in the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traub|first1=Valerie|title=The New Unhistoricism in Queer Studies|journal=PMLA|date=2013|volume=128|issue=1|doi=10.1632/pmla.2013.128.1.21|pages=21–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background concepts==

Queer theory is grounded in gender and sexuality. Due to this association, a debate emerges as to whether sexual orientation is [[Nature (philosophy)|natural]] or [[Essence|essential]] to the person, as an [[Gender essentialism|essentialist]] believes, or if sexuality is a social construction and subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P 2002, ''Lesbian/gay criticism'', in P Barry (eds), Beginning theory: an introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester, pp139-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essentialist feminists believed that genders "have an essential nature (e.g. nurturing and caring versus being aggressive and selfish), as opposed to differing by a variety of accidental or contingent features brought about by social forces".&lt;ref name="blackburn1996"&gt;Blackburn, S 1996, "essentialism", Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, (Oxford Reference Online).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this belief in the essential nature of a person, it is also natural to assume that a person's sexual preference would be natural and essential to a person's [[personality]].

Social constructivism is a concept that proposes the realities we produce and the meanings we create are a result of social [[interaction]]; communicating and existing in a cultural context that conveys meaning to us. Our world is a product of continuous “claims making, labelling and other constitutive definitional processes”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Biever | first1 = Joan L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = The Social Construction Of Gender: A Comparison Of Feminist And Postmodern Approaches | url = | journal = Counselling Psychology Quarterly | volume = 11 | issue = 2| page = 163 | doi=10.1080/09515079808254052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, queer theorists have offered the argument that there is no essential self at all, and that people exist not just as subjects but also as objects of the social world. In this way, an identity is not born but rather constructed through repeated [[Performativity|performative actions]] that are in turn informed by existing social constructions of gender. By thus analyzing and understanding the ways in which gender is shared and historically constituted, the production of gender can occur differently and beyond a socially constructed binary upon which heterosexuality depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = J | year = 1988 | title = Performative acts and gender constitution: An essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | url = | journal = Theatre Journal | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 519–531 | doi=10.2307/3207893| jstor = 3207893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity politics==
{{Main|Identity politics#LGBT issues}}
Queer theory was originally associated with [[Political radicalism|radical]] gay politics of [[Act up|ACT UP]], [[OutRage!]] and other groups which embraced "queer" as an identity label that pointed to a [[Separatism|separatist]], [[cultural assimilation|non-assimilationist]] politics.&lt;ref name="blackburn1996"/&gt; Queer theory developed out of an examination of perceived limitations in the traditional [[identity politics]] of recognition and [[self-identity]]. In particular, queer theorists identified processes of consolidation or stabilization around some other identity labels (e.g. gay and lesbian); and construed queerness so as to resist this. Queer theory attempts to maintain a critique more than define a specific identity. These critiques are expressed through a whole range of notions in subfields such as [[ecotechnics]] within technology studies.

Acknowledging the inevitable [[Political violence|violence]] of identity politics, and having no stake in its own [[ideology]], queer is less an identity than a critique of identity. However, it is in no position to imagine itself outside the circuit of problems energized by identity politics.  Instead of defending itself against those criticisms that its operations attract, queer allows those criticisms to shape its – for now unimaginable – future directions. "The term," writes Butler, "will be revised, dispelled, rendered obsolete to the extent that it yields to the demands which resist the term precisely because of the exclusions by which it is mobilized." The mobilization of queer foregrounds the conditions of political representation, its intentions and effects, its resistance to and recovery by the existing networks of power.&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, P, ''A Concise Glossary of Cultural Theory'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies of Fuss anticipate queer theory. Fuss analyzes queer theory while surpassing the concept of identity politics to assert the nature in how to distinguish people who were not heterosexual from people who are without asserting the positionally of the two from the lens of a binary.&lt;ref&gt;Fuss, D. 1991. "Inside/Out." Pp. 1–10 in Inside/Out. Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories, edited by D. Fuss. New York and London: Rougledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eng, Halberstam and Esteban Munoz offer one of its latest incarnations in the aptly titled "What is Queer about Queer studies now?".&lt;ref&gt;Eng, D. L., J. Halberstam, and J. E. Munoz. 2005. "Introduction: What’s Queer about Queer Studies Now?" Social Text 84–85:1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Judith Butler's critique of sexual identity categories as a starting point, they work around a "queer epistemology" that explicitly opposes the sexual categories of Lesbian and Gay studies and lesbian and gay identity politics. They insist that the field of normalization is not limited to sexuality; social classifications such as gender, race and nationality constituted by a "governing logic" require an epistemological intervention through queer theory." &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Adam Isaiah|date=2007-03|title=Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies|journal=Sociological Theory|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=26–45|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2007.00296.x|issn=0735-2751}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So, the evolution of the queer begins with the problematization of sexual identity categories in Fuss (1996) and extends outward to a more general deconstruction of social [[ontology]] in contemporary queer theory." &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

"Edelman goes from deconstruction of the subject to a deconstructive psychoanalysis of the entire social order; the modern human fear of mortality produces defensive attempts to "suture over the hole in the Symbolic Order."&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, L. 2004. No Future. Durham and London: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, constructions of "the homosexual" are pitted against constructions of "The Child" in the modern West, wherein the former symbolizes the inevitability of mortality (do not procreate) and the latter an illusory continuity of the self with the social order (survives mortality through one's offspring). The constructs are animated by futuristic fantasy designed to evade mortality." &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

"Fuss, Eng. et al and Edelman represent a distinct moment in the development of queer theory. Whereas Fuss aims to discompose and render inert the reigning classifications of sexual identity, Eng. et al observe the extension of a deconstructive strategy to a wider field of normalization, while Edelman’s work takes not only the specter of "the homosexual", but the very notion of "society" as a manifestation of psychological distress requiring composition."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Intersex and the role of biology==

Queer theorists focus on problems in classifying individuals as either [[male]] or [[female]], even on a strictly biological basis. For example, the sex [[chromosome]]s ([[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome|Y]]) may exist in atypical combinations (as in [[Klinefelter syndrome]] [XXY]). This complicates the use of [[genotype]] as a means to define exactly two distinct sexes. [[Intersex]] individuals may for various biological reasons have [[Primary sexual characteristics|sexual characteristics]] that the dominant medical discourse regards as [[disorders of sex development|disordered]].

Scientists who have written on the conceptual significance of intersex individuals include [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], [[Katrina Karkazis]], [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]], and [[Joan Roughgarden]]. While the [[Disorders of sex development|medical literature]] focuses increasingly on genetics of intersex traits, and even their [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis#Ethical issues|deselection]], some scholars on the study of culture, such as [[Barbara Rogoff]], argue that the traditional distinction between biology and culture as independent entities is overly simplistic, pointing to the ways in which biology and culture interact with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Barbara. ''The Cultural Nature of Human Development''. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2003: 63–64. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex scholars and scientists who have written on intersex include [[Morgan Holmes]], [[Georgiann Davis]], [[Iain Morland]] and [[Janik Bastien-Charlebois]], in each case focusing on more particular realities of the intersex experience. In his essay ''What Can Queer Theory Do for Intersex?'' Morland contrasts queer "hedonic activism" with an experience of post-surgical insensate intersex bodies to claim that "queerness is characterized by the sensory interrelation of pleasure and shame".&lt;ref name="after"&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last=Morland |editor1-first=Iain |date=2009 |title=Intersex and After |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Intersex-and-After/ |journal=[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] |publisher= |volume=15 |issue=2 |isbn=978-0-8223-6705-5 |pages= |doi= |accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disability Theory and queer theory ==
In Robert McRuer's ''Crip Theory,'' he mentions the intersection between disability theory and queer theory and how they are aided by their own association with each other and what is normal; for instance, the connection between upholding an able-bodied identity and heterosexuality. He argues that an able-bodied identity functions as more of a subconscious mentality of normality than heterosexuality. McRuer argues that there is a system that is established to distinguish those who are able-bodied from those who have disabilities; that distinction that was instituted the disability concept. Following that same dynamic, the subjection of homosexuality in relation to heterosexuality founded the basis of homosexuality. McRuer emphasizes how the intersecting of queer theory and disability theory would cultivate, “critically disabled spaces overlapping with the critically queer spaces that activists and scholars have shaped during recent decades, in which we can identify and challenge the ongoing consolidation of heterosexual, able-bodied hegemony.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crip Theory Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|publisher=New York: New York University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780814759868|location=|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of Crip Theory by McRuer was not only built on neoliberism but also critically engages with the fundamentality of the term “disability” and the manner that it paradoxically operates. McRuer asserts the nature of which that queer theory and disability theory benefit each other. The functions of the concept of able-bodiedness is utilized as an additional tool to strengthen and maintain the concept of heterosexuality and heteronormativy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafer|first=Alison|date=2009|title=What's Crip About Queer Theory Now?|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=|pages=291–294|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS and queer theory==

Much of queer theory developed out of a response to the [[AIDS]] crisis, which promoted a renewal of radical activism, and the growing homophobia brought about by public responses to AIDS. Queer theory became occupied in part with what effects – put into circulation around the AIDS epidemic – necessitated and nurtured new forms of political organization, education and theorizing in "queer".

To examine the effects that HIV/AIDS has on queer theory is to look at the ways in which the status of the subject or individual is treated in the biomedical discourses that construct them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Haraway]], ''The Biopolitics of Postmodern Bodies'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The shift, affected by safer [[sex education]] in emphasizing [[sexual practices]] over sexual identities&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bartos, ''Meaning of Sex Between Men'', 1993 and G.W. Dowsett, ''Men Who Have Sex With Men'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The persistent misrecognition of HIV/AIDS as a gay disease&lt;ref&gt;Richard Meyer, ''Rock Hudson's Body'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Homosexuality as a kind of fatality&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Hanson, ''Unread'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The coalition politics of much HIV/AIDS activism that rethinks identity in terms of affinity rather than essence&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Saalfield, ''Shocking Pink Praxis'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore includes not only lesbians and gay men but also bisexuals, [[transsexuals]], [[sex workers]], [[people with AIDS]], [[health workers]], and parents and friends of gays; the pressing recognition that discourse is not a separate or second-order reality&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A 1996, Queer Theory, [http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-Dec-1996/jagose.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The constant emphasis on contestation in resisting [[Misconceptions about HIV/AIDS|dominant depictions]] of [[HIV]] and AIDS and representing them otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Lee 2013, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tb5YAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=%22totalizable%20identity%22&amp;f=false Homographesis: Essays in Gay Literary and Cultural Theory]'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1134567232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The rethinking of traditional understandings of the workings of power in cross-hatched struggles over epidemiology, scientific research, public health and immigration policy&lt;ref&gt;David Halperin, ''Homosexuality: A Cultural Construct'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The material effects of AIDS contested many [[cultural assumptions]] about identity, justice, desire and knowledge. One scholar claimed that AIDS challenged the health and immunity of Western [[epistemology]]: "the psychic presence of AIDS signifies a collapse of identity and difference that refuses to be abjected from the systems of self-knowledge." (p.&amp;nbsp;292)&lt;ref name="Yingling"&gt;Yingling, Thomas. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=0cbuW1iQVIwC&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20psychic%20presence%20of%20AIDS%22&amp;f=false AIDS in America: Postmodern Governance, Identity, and Experience]" in Diana Fuss, ed., ''Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories''. Psychology Press, 1991. pp. 291-310. {{ISBN|978-0415902373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus queer theory and AIDS become interconnected because each is articulated through a postmodernist understanding of the death of the subject and both understand identity as an ambivalent site.

==Role of language==
:''For language use as associated with sexual identity, see [[Lavender linguistics]].''

Richard Norton suggests that queer language evolved from structures and [[Labeling theory|labels]] imposed by a [[mainstream culture]].

Early discourse of queer theory involved leading theorists: Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and others. This discourse centered on the way that knowledge of sexuality was structured through the use of language. Michel Foucault writes in "[[The History of Sexuality]]", critiquing the idea of the “repressive hypothesis” that supposes from the 17th to the mid-20th century, sex was a private matter limited within a marriage between a husband and wife, and discourses of sex have been otherwise prohibited and repressed. As a result of this repression, people sought outlets to release sexual feelings, building their own discourses of sex and thus liberating themselves from the confines of a sexually repressive society.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The History of Sexuality, volume I: La Volonté de savoir'', 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault argues that the “repressive hypothesis” is a limiting attempt to connect open discourses of sex to personal liberation. This sort of narrative which views discourses of sex as revolutionary [[Idea of progress|progress]] against a repressive system is dependent on the assumption that people of the past were [[sexually repressed]]; however, Foucault states that from the 17th to the mid-20th century the "'repressive hypothesis"' was an illusion, rather a suppression of western society's sexuality. In fact, discourse about sexuality flourished during this time period. Foucault argues,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Western man has been drawn for three centuries to the task of telling everything concerning his sex;that since the classical age there has been a constant optimization and increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multiple effects of displacement,intensification, reorientation and modification of desire itself. Not only were the boundaries of what one could say about sex enlarged, and men compelled to hear it said; but more important, discourse was connected to sex by a complex organization with varying effects, by a deployment that cannot be adequately explained merely by referring it to a law of prohibition. A censorship of sex? There was installed rather an apparatus for producing an ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of functioning and taking effect in its very economy." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foucault says at this time there was a political, economic and technical excitement to talk about sex. Sex became a call for management procedures. It became a policing matter.

[[Heteronormativity]] was the main focus of discourse, where heterosexuality was viewed as normal and any deviations, such as homosexuality, as abnormal or "queer". Even before the founding of "queer theory" the Modern Language Association (MLA) came together for a convention in 1973 for the first formal gay-studies seminar due to the rise of lesbian and gay writers and issues of gay and lesbian textuality. The convention was entitled "Gay Literature: Teaching and Research." In 1981, the MLA established the Division of Gay Studies in Language and Literature.

==Media and other creative works==

Many queer theorists have produced creative works that reflect theoretical perspectives in a wide variety of media. For example, [[LGBT themes in speculative fiction|science fiction]] authors such as [[Samuel R. Delany]] and [[Octavia Butler]] feature many values and themes from queer theory in their work. [[Patrick Califia]]'s published fiction also draws heavily on concepts and ideas from queer theory. Some [[lesbian feminist]] novels written in the years immediately following [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]], such as ''[[Lover (novel)|Lover]]'' by [[Bertha Harris]] or ''[[Les Guérillères]]'' by [[Monique Wittig]], can be said to anticipate the terms of later queer theory. [[Núria Perpinyà|Nuria Perpinya]], a Catalan literary theorist, wrote ''A good mistake'', a novel about the awkward homosexuality in a London genetic engineering lab, between a young white man and a black scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Núria Perpinyà, [http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=172&amp;lang=en ''A good mistake''] 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In film, the genre christened by [[B. Ruby Rich]] as [[New Queer Cinema]] in 1992 continues, as [[Queer Cinema]], to draw heavily on the prevailing critical climate of queer theory; a good early example of this is the [[Jean Genet]]-inspired movie ''[[Poison (film)|Poison]]'' by the director [[Todd Haynes]]. In [[fan fiction]], the genre known as [[slash fiction]] rewrites straight or nonsexual relationships to be gay, bisexual, and queer in a sort of [[Camp (style)|campy]] cultural appropriation. [[Ann Herendeen]]'s ''Pride/Prejudice'',&lt;ref&gt;Pam Rosenthal, "[http://historyhoydens.blogspot.com/2010/09/another-take-on-pride-and-prejudice.html Another Take on Pride And Prejudice]", ''History Hoydens''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, narrates a steamy affair between [[Mr. Darcy]] and Mr. Bingley, the mutually devoted heroes of [[Jane Austen]]'s [[Pride and Prejudice|much-adapted novel]].  And in music, some [[Queercore]] groups and [[zines]] could be said to reflect the values of queer theory.&lt;ref&gt;Matias Viegener, "The only haircut that makes sense anymore," in ''Queer Looks: Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Media'' (Routledge, New York: 1993) &amp; "Kinky Escapades, Bedroom Techniques, Unbridled Passion, and Secret Sex Codes," in ''Camp Grounds: Gay &amp; Lesbian Style'' (U Mass, Boston: 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theorists analyze texts and challenge the cultural notions of "straight" ideology; that is, does "straight" imply heterosexuality as normal or is everyone potentially gay? As Ryan states: "It is only the laborious imprinting of heterosexual norms that cuts away those potentials and manufactures heterosexuality as the dominant sexual format."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, M., 1999. ''Literary Theory: a practical introduction''. Oxford. Blackwell, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Hollywood pursues the "straight" theme as being the dominant theme to outline what masculine is. This is particularly noticeable in gangster films, action films and westerns, which never have "weak" (read: homosexual) men playing the heroes, with the recent exception of the film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. Queer theory looks at destabilizing and shifting the boundaries of these cultural constructions.

[[New Media]] artists have a long history of queer theory inspired works, including [[cyberfeminism]] works, porn films like ''[[I.K.U.]]'' which feature transgender cyborg hunters and "Sharing is Sexy", an "open source porn laboratory", using social software, creative commons licensing and netporn to explore queer sexualities beyond the male/female binary.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Racism ==
{{See also|Racism in the LGBT community|LGBT culture#Racism|LGBT stereotypes#Intersections between LGBT, race, and class stereotypes}}
Within the [[LGBTQ community]], there lies a distinguishing marker between those who just identify as LGBTQ and those who identify with both an oppressed race alongside being LGBTQ. In "Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens", Cathy Cohen critiques modern day queer politics, arguing that lack of recognition of LGBTQ people who face other forms of oppression results in many queers not being supported or acknowledged by Queer politics. Cohen states: "how do queer activists understand and relate politically to those whose same-sex sexual identities position them within the category of queer, but who hold other identities based on class, race and/or gender categories".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Cathy|date=|title=Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics|url=|journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pinpoints the idea she is attempting to make in that the politics of Queer do not encompass all of the [[Queer community]] but only those with the most privilege within the group: primarily [[upper class]], [[White privilege|white]] [[cisgender]] [[Male privilege|men]]. Since this is the case, how then, can a [[Person of Color]] who is also LGBTQ-identifying feel welcomed, supported, and represented if they are being cast aside? Cohen attempts to explain this by stating: "'Unlike the early lesbian and gay movement, which had both ideological and practical links to the left, black activism and feminism, today's 'queer' politicos seem to operate in a historical and ideological vacuum. 'Queer' activists focus on 'queer' issues, and racism, sexual oppression and economic exploitation do not qualify, despite the fact that the majority of 'queers' are people of color, female or working class..."&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; This lack of recognition is leaving a hefty portion of the LGBTQ community unsupported in all of their endeavors, and it primarily gives aid to those who are LGBTQ and identify as [[white people|white]].

The concept was created out of the mentality that queerness equals deviance. It strives to display the error in assuming that everyone experiences one sole monolithic existence, which establishes the gay white male experience to be central to all other experiences, and that all other experiences derives from the gay white male experience. By institutions establishing and reinforcing the concept that there is a uniform experience that all people from one race endure, it maintains an environment centered on white discourse within the queer community that establishes a “false intimacy.” That false intimacy fails to provide queer youth of color with the support that is necessary to recognize and analyze the intersectionality of their being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Catherine O.|last2=Ore|first2=Tracy E.|date=2010|title=(Un) Covering Normalized Gender and Race Subjectivities in LGBT "Safe Spaces"|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=36|issue=3|pages=629–649|jstor=27919125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to this oppression, many scholars and queer theorists use [[queer of color critique]] as a practice in both their academic work and personal activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El-Tayeb | first1 = F | year = 2012 | title = 'Gays Who Cannot Properly Be Gay': Queer Muslims in the Neoliberal European City | url = | journal = European Journal of Women's Studies | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 79–95 | doi=10.1177/1350506811426388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban.

=== Racialization of the body ===
[[Racism]] has long been embedded within queer theory since the creation of the homosexual body and identity. Siobhan Sommerville's "Scientific Racism and the Invention of the Homosexual Body"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommerville|first=Siobhan|date=|title=Scientific Racism and the Invention of the Homosexual Body|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the invention of homosexuality among the [[scientific community]] as coming at about the same time as the reformulation of [[racial theories]]. According to Sommerville, when there were aggressive attempts to separate and [[Color terminology for race|classify bodies as black or white]], there was also the classification of bodies as heterosexual or homosexual.

Havelock Ellis, an English physician, writer, [[Progressivism|progressive]] intellectual and [[social reformer]], suggested that homosexuality is not a crime, but a [[Wiktionary:congenital|congenital]] [[Human physiology|physiological]] abnormality; he believed that the "invert" was visually distinguishable from the "normal" [[Human body|body]] through [[anatomical]] markers (like the difference between [[male]] and [[female]] bodies).

This was the same as the ideas about the difference between [[racialized]] bodies. There was the idea that [[Black women|black]] and white women's bodies held major differences. Black women were often referred to as the "Bushman race": having strongly muscled [[Posterior (anatomy)|posteriors]], highly [[Afro-textured hair|textured hair]] and other [[Human physical appearance|physical characteristics]] that were considered outside the boundaries of 'normal' female bodies (based on white [[Feminine beauty ideal|beauty standards]]). W.H. Flower and James Murie constructed a site of racial difference by marking the sexual and [[Female reproductive system|reproductive]] anatomy of the African woman as "peculiar." The characteristics of [[African American]] women were consistent with the medical characterizations of lesbians; such as having an "unusually large [[clitoris]]." These supposed distinguishing characteristics further separated not only heterosexual people from queer people, but also white from black, and white homosexual bodies from queer people of color.

=== Racialization of space ===
Racism also exists within [[queer spaces]]. In "Out There: The Topography of Race and Desire in the Global City"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manalansan|first=Martin|date=|title=Out There: The Topography of Race and Desire in the Global City|url=|journal=Global Divas|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Manalansan focuses on the [[gay community in New York City]], most specifically in [[LGBT culture in New York City#Manhattan|Manhattan]]. According to Manalansan, New York City is known to be a [[gay Mecca]]. However, this portrayal, in focusing on Manhattan, centers white, [[Middle class|middle]]/upper class men. The gay community in New York is known to be held exclusively in Manhattan, as this is the area that most people who are not from New York City know. People who are outside of the heart of Manhattan and the gay community there are, literally, "out there". Those who are of different races, gender, or class occupy different spaces and communities which seldom overlap.

Manalansan gives a detailed description of the [[topography]] of New York City in order to show the actual physical and [[Cultural divide|cultural barriers]] that exists between the different boroughs and the gay communities that exist there. Outside of Manhattan, the gay communities are divided by cultural and racial barriers; the [[Hispanics and Latinos in New York|Latin]], [[Asian Americans in New York City|Asian]], and [[African Americans in New York City|Black]] gay communities do not overlap and are also physically distanced from each other. Space is inherently racialized. The racialized gay communities and spaces in New York City only further alienate queer people of color and make them less valued and validated in gay culture.

Carly Thompsen's article "In Plain(s) Sight: Rural LGBTQ Women and the Politics of Visibility" also sheds light on racial issues within visibility politics. In this piece, Thomsen analyzes the estrangement between strategies and discourses of national [[lesbian and gay rights organizations]] and the strategies and discourses of LGBTQ women in the rural [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. She argues that it is crucial for rural queer studies to critique contemporary visibility politics. Due to the overemphasis of an essentially [[urban ethos]], rural LBGTQ politics are usually overshadowed and ignored. This undermining of rural identities in LGBTQ politics is problematic for rural LGBTQ progress. She concludes that rural queer studies must be weary of right-seeking approaches to visibility politics because they indirectly allow the abjection of the rural. From this, Thompsen reflects on how LBGTQ visibility politics as a whole aid to the existence of, and even strengthen [[Queer Metronormativity|metronormativity]] by showing the dominance of [[Urban area|urban]] communities over [[Rural area|rural]] communities in gaining prominence in [[LGBTQ movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompsen|first1=Carly|title=In Plain(s) Sight: Rural LGBTQ Women and the Politics of Visibility|journal=Queering the Countryside: New Frontiers in Rural Queer Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Thomsen argues against metronormative ideals of the [[global city]] as always the most progressive, comfortable and [[Social inclusion|inclusive]] space for queer people. Emily Skidmore pushes back on metronormative assumption in her article "Ralph Kerwineo's Queer Body: Narrating the Scales of Social Membership in the Early 20th Century". Her work outlines the life of Ralph Kerwineo, a person born as a black woman, who moves from [[Chicago]] to early 20th century [[Milwaukee]] and passed as a [[Hispanic]] man in the then small town experiencing large influxes of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]]. Skidmore analyzed newspaper stories of Kerwineo when his ex-girlfriend publicly accused him of being a woman. &amp;nbsp;She found that articles from local papers in Milwaukee were more accepting of Kerwineo's [[gender identity]] regardless of his racial identity (throughout the media outburst he variably identified as [[European Americans|white]], Latin, black and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]) whereas national papers immediately jumped to accusations of Kerwineo's [[perversion]] and guilt. While Milwaukee papers empathized with him, emphasizing that he was always an upstanding member of society, and creating stories of women of color just trying to survive in a difficult situation, national news sources [[Wiktionary:pathologize|pathologized]] Kerwineo, linking racial, sexual, and gender [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]] to paint a picture of incontestable guilt. &amp;nbsp;Skidmore uses this example to show that queer people have found acceptance and community in places other than global cities, showing that the specific [[Social dynamics|social]] and racial dynamics of Milwaukee at that time provided a safer environment for Kerwineo. Thus, despite metronormative assumptions of national, or larger urban, spaces as queer utopias, their discourses around queer bodies can in fact be more [[Toleration|intolerant]] of people with non-normative gender, sexual, and racial identities than other places.

=== Racialization outside the United States ===
[[LGBT history in Israel|Israel]], in attempts to brand itself as a gay mecca, has been accused of [[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]. This is the main idea of the article: "Israel's Gay Propaganda War", written by [[Jasbir Puar]], in which she highlights the [[Criticism of the Israeli government|hypocrisy of the Israeli state]] in branding itself as a gay mecca, attempting to show how progressive the state is despite its [[dehumanizing]] acts against the [[Palestinian people]]. In the midst of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], Israel has been accused of many violations of [[Human rights in Israel|human rights]] against the Palestinian people, and has received an international reputation for being an [[Imperialism|imperial]] aggressor. Their response to this was to proclaim to the [[international community]] that they are more developed and essentially say: "Israel is civilised, Palestinians are barbaric, homophobic, uncivilised, suicide-bombing fanatics. It produces Israel as the only gay-friendly country in an otherwise hostile region."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/01/israels-gay-propaganda-war|title=Israel's gay propaganda war|date=2010-07-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this entails is Israel is essentially oppressing Palestinians further through their use of [[gay-friendly]] propaganda, which also hides its own problems as state dealing with homophobia as well. What Puar tries to argue is that Israel uses this branding as a method to further justify their treatment of the Palestinian people, and she argues further that the image being portrayed towards Palestinians de-legitimizes those who identify as Queer who are Palestinian since Israel does not support the [[LGBTQ groups in Palestine]], nor does it acknowledge their existence.

In "Queer Injuries: The Racial Politics of 'Homophobic Hate Crime' in Germany", Jin Haritaworn calls attention to the tradeoffs between the passing of Anti-[[Hate Crime]] legislation. In this piece, Haritaworn examines the problems with [[hate crime legislation in Germany]] and how racist views are still manifested in anti-hate crime laws and have racial ramifications. The move of LGBTQ activism into the judicial sphere enables police and military systems to reinvent themselves as the protector of [[Minority group|minorities]] while police activity [[Institutional racism|targeting racialized populations]] is reaching new heights. Additionally, these newly publicized and politicized subjectivities and embodiments still adhere to a specific [[neoliberal ideology]] and fantasy. Incorporating [[criminal justice]] analysis into sexual justice narratives, Haritaworn finds that internationally, LGBTQ anti-hate legislation still marginalizes and represses other minorities by forcing victim-perpetrator narratives that target certain groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haritaworn|first1=Jin|title=Queer Injuries: The Racial Politics of 'Homophobic Hate Crime' in Germany|journal=Social Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmanuel David researches transgender people—primarily trans women—in call centers in the Philippines. In these spaces, David finds that international corporations are integrating trans women into the workforce in a way that both requires them to perform gender labor and David partake in the neoliberal capitalist system as members of the periphery. In his article "Purple-Collar Labor: Transgender Workers and Queer Value at Global Call Centers in the Philippines", David outlines how transgender filipina call center workers are expected to keep morale up by performing in fashion shows, staying happy and joking around with their team members, all for the sake of worker productivity. He shows that trans women that do not uphold these standards or who are not extroverted in their work interactions are not as accepted in their gender identity as the trans women workers who are openly flamboyant and funny. This research highlights a portion of the queer community outside of the core, upper class, white, male, US urban population and pushes back on assumptions of 'Out There' being a space of intolerance, danger and conformity, but also highlights how queer bodies can be integrated into the global capitalist system and normalized in a place many readers might not expect.

== Feminism ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality#Feminism and queer theory}}Queer and feminist theories, like other perspectives based on socially-based identities and gender, tend to overlap. Both of these theories are described as responses to the "essentializing" of gender and sexual identities, which lead to the oppression of those who do not conform to socially constructed gender norms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Sexual Identity: Transcending Feminist and Queer Theory|last=Nagoshi|first=Julie|last2=Nagoshi|first2=Craig|last3=Brzuzy|first3=Stephanie|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781461489658|location=New York|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights their similarity in the view that gender-related identity is [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]. There is thus an agreement that the [[oppression]] of women and sexual minority groups can be challenged by way of a self-constructive process that rejects the perceived inferiority of this group within the social order.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While queer and feminist theories share several commonalities, this does not mean that they are easily commensurable, with some thinkers citing that they could even be an awkward pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism Meets Queer Theory|last=Weed|first=Elizabeth|last2=Schor|first2=Naomi|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0253332783|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One overlap of queer theory and feminist theory is through the recognition and influence of Judith Butler and Butler's cultivation of the relationship of gender and sexuality that has come to found the basis of queer theory concerns.  The analysis of society in relation to sexuality and gender, is a display of dominance that shows the way that biology is influenced by culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Katherine|date=2005-03-01|title=Queer Theory|journal=Group Analysis|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=67–81|doi=10.1177/0533316405049369|issn=0533-3164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key difference between the queer and feminist theories involves their respective scope. Feminist theory is only concerned about the issues affecting women and [[Women's empowerment|women empowerment]] while the subjects of queer theory are diverse and include women, homosexuals, transsexuals, and those considered deviants. Queer theory is also distinguished from feminist theory in the sense that it asserts identity as a conceptual category, serving as "a disciplinary apparatus that that pigeonholes the fluidity of the self into a politically docile normativity."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Everybody: Feminism, Queer Theory, and Marxism at the Intersection|last=Lewis|first=Holly|publisher=Zed Books, Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=9781783602889|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist position is that '[[identity politics]]' is a political error that occurs once a standpoint gets overemphasized or naturalized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Essay|date=September 2018}}

Typically, critics of queer theory are concerned that the approach obscures or glosses altogether the material conditions that underpin discourse.&lt;ref name = "Edwards"&gt;{{Citation | last= Edwards | first= Tim | title= Queer Fears: Against the Cultural Turn | journal= Sexualities |volume= 1 | year= 1998 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | doi= 10.1177/136346098001004005 | issue= 4 | pages= 471–484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Edwards argues that queer theory extrapolates too broadly from textual analysis in undertaking an examination of the social.&lt;ref name = "Edwards"/&gt;

Adam Green's critique is one approach to queer theory, that leans towards a sociological stance on the issue of sexuality; primarily and rather exc&lt;ref name="Green1"&gt;{{Citation | doi= 10.1023/A:1020976902569 | last= Green | first= Adam | title= Gay But Not Queer: Toward a Post-Queer Study of Sexuality | journal= Theory and Society | volume= 31 | issue= 4 | pages= 521–545 | year= 2002 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; lusively, focusing on gay or lesbian subjects. Green argues that queer theory ignores the social and institutional conditions within which lesbians and gays live. For example, queer theory dismantles social contingency in some cases (homosexual subject positions) while recuperating social contingency in others (racialized subject positions). Thus, not all queer theoretical work is as faithful to its deconstructionist roots. Reflecting on this issue, Timothy Laurie suggests that "the desire to resist norms in some contemporary queer scholarship can never be entirely reconciled with an equally important challenge, that of producing both adequate and dynamic descriptions of ordinary events".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Qualitative Research Journal | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | pages= 64–78 | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/6262250 | doi=10.1108/qrj-03-2014-0011| hdl= 10453/44221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theory's commitment to deconstruction makes it nearly impossible to speak of a "lesbian" or "gay" subject, since all social categories are denaturalized and reduced to discourse.&lt;ref name = "Gamson"&gt;{{Citation |last= Gamson

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, queer theory cannot be a framework for examining selves or subjectivities—including those that accrue by race and class—but rather, must restrict its analytic focus to discourse.&lt;ref name = "Green2"/&gt; Hence, [[sociology]] and queer theory are regarded as methodologically and [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] frameworks&lt;ref name = Green2&gt;{{Citation | doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9558.2007.00296.x | last= Green | first= Adam | title= Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies | journal= Sociological Theory | volume= 25 | issue= 1 | pages= 26–45| year= 2007 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; by critics such as Adam Isaiah Green. Thus Green writes that, in an introductory section,&lt;ref&gt;Warner, M. 1993. "Introduction." Pp. viii–xxxi in Fear of a Queer Planet. Queer Politics and Social Theory, edited by M. Warner. Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Warner]] (1990s) draws out the possibility of queer theory as a kind of critical intervention in social theory (radical deconstructionism); despite this, he weaves back and forth between the reification and deconstruction of sexual identity. Green argues that Warner begins the volume by invoking an ethnic identity politics, solidified around a specific social cleavage and a discussion of the importance of deconstructing notions of lesbian and gay identities; but, despite its radical deconstructionism, it constructs the queer subject or self in largely conventional terms: as lesbian and gay people bound by homophobic institutions and practices.

So, one of the leading volumes of queer theory engages the subject via conventional sociological epistemologies that conceive of subject positions constituted through systems of stratification and organized around shared experience and identity.

In other way, for Ian Barnard,&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, I. 1999. "Queer Race." Social Semiotics 9(2):199–211.&lt;/ref&gt; any consideration of sexuality must include inextricability with racialized subjectivities. Adam Green argues that Barnard implicitly rejects the queer theoretical conceptions of sexuality on the grounds that such work fails to account for particularity of racialized sexualities. He reasons that the failure arises because queer theorists are themselves white, and therefore operate from the particularity of a white racial standpoint. Barnard aspires to recuperate an analysis of race in queer theory, proposing that the deconstructionist epistemology of queer theory can be used to decompose a white queerness (first) in order to recover a racialized queerness (second).
Thus, Adam Green argues that Barnard's attempt to bring social contingency into queer theory violates the core epistemological premise of queer theory; in fact, by proposing that queer theory capture racialized subject positions, Barnard reinstates what it means to be a person of colour. His critique of the white subject position of queer theorists is itself a testimony to the stability of the social order and the power of social categories to mark a particular kind of experience, of subjectivity and, in turn, of queer author. He backs down the road of a decidedly sociological analysis of subject position and the self.
Finally, [[Annamarie Jagose|Jagose]]&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A. 1996. Queer Theory: An Introduction. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Green observes that Jagose aims toward an analysis of social cleavages, including those accruing by race and ethnicity. Thus, on the one, Jagose underscores the strong deconstructionist epistemological premise of the term queer and queer theory more generally. Yet, she goes on to analyze identities and sexualities "inflected by heterosexuality, race, gender and ethnicity".
Thus Adam Green states that by advocating the incorporation of social contingency in this way, Jagose offers neither the critical edge of queer theory nor the clarity of standpoint theory. However, on the topic of race, Jagose asserted that for a black lesbian, the thing of utmost importance is her lesbianism, rather than her race. Many gays and lesbians of color attacked this approach, accusing it of re-inscribing an essentially white identity into the heart of gay or lesbian identity (Jagose, 1996).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Queer Theory and the Social Construction of Sexuality|work=Homosexuality|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 November 2011|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/#QueTheSocConSex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism of queer theory can be divided in three main ideas:&lt;ref&gt;Green, A. I. "Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies". University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has a failing itineration, the "subjectless critique" of queer studies
* The unsustainable analysis of this failing self
* The methodological implication that scholars of sexuality end up reiterating and consolidating social categories

Green's views  suggest gay conservation and assimilation that derive from a more traditional perspective. His concerns regarding the potential loss of a critical edge by incorporating too much discourse on nonsexual identities is valid, however, theorists like Ruth Goldman and Cathy J. Cohen, think elsewise.

In Ruth Goldman's essay “Who Is That? Exploring Norms around Sexuality, Race, and Class in Queer Theory," she examines how rhetoric works to create a “normative discourse within queer theory” (169), and how that rhetoric serves to limit our perception of queer. In stark opposition to Green's critique, Goldman argues that in order to comply with queer theories intent to challenge the normal, it must provide a framework in which to challenge other oppressive norms that intersect with sexuality (i.e. racism, misogyny, classism, etc.). By acknowledging the intersection of multiple oppressions is to dismantle a single-issue framework, and thus, creating a platform for a more intensive analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3RwTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=bell+hooks+queer+theory+#v=onepage&amp;q=bell%20hooks%20queer%20theory&amp;f=false|title=Queer Studies: A Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Anthology|last=Beemyn|first=Brett|last2=Eliason|first2=Michele|date=1996-01-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814712573|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorist Cathy J. Cohen offers a complex critique in "Punks, Bulldaggers and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics" that supports Goldman's ideology. Queerness, according to Cohen, provides conceptualizations that break the traditional binary visibility. Unlike single-identity-based frameworks—failing to serve those with multi-oppressed identities—queerness has the potential to unite these aspects of self to spark a more cohesive understanding of oppression. Yet Cohen expresses concerns surrounding the dichotomy between queer and heterosexual. This binary has created a misdirection of dialogue surrounding power dynamics. Thus an undercomplicated understanding of power has been sexually categorized: all heterosexuals are characterized as privileged and all queers are deemed as oppressed. As a result, queer politics have prioritized only one factor, sexuality as the primary lens through which they structure their action. Encouraging this method of thinking rejects others that are in or in-between the margins. Cohen states that to fully grasp the advantages of queer theory, ideals need to be further radicalized; as well as, push an intersectional lens when analyzing issues.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.isabelcporras.com/punks%2Bbulldaggers%2Bcohen.pdf|title=Punks, Bulldaggers and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics|last=Cohen|first=J.

Green argues that queer is itself an identity category that some self-identified "queer theorists" and "queer activists" use to consolidate a subject-position outside of the normalizing regimes of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{Citation | last= Green | first= Adam Isaiah | title= Remembering Foucault: Queer Theory &amp; Disciplinary Power | journal= Sexualities | volume= 13 | issue= 3 | year= 2010 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | doi= 10.1177/1363460709364321 | pages= 316–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These examples call into question the degree to which identity categories need be thought of as negative, in the evaluative sense of that term, as they underscore the self-determining potentials of the care of the self – an idea advanced first by Foucault in Volumes II and III of The History of Sexuality.

The role of queer theory, and specifically its replacement of historical and sociological scholarship on lesbian and gay people's lives with the theorising of lesbian and gay issues, and the displacement of gay and lesbian studies by gender and queer studies, has been criticised by activist and writer [[Larry Kramer]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Charles, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090502193413/http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid81256.asp Larry Kramer's Case Against "Queer"] Advocate.com, April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/28/kramer|title=Inside Higher Ed's News|website=www.insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/|title=The Daily Beast|website=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer reports on a book by Richard Godbeer, a professor of history and gender studies at the University of Miami, called The Overflowing of Friendship. Kramer criticizes Godbeer's account of 18th century Colonial times. Kramer writes, "Godbeer is hell-bent on convincing us that two men in Colonial America could have exceedingly obsessive and passionate relationships (he called them, variously, 'sentimental,' 'loving,' 'romantic') . . . [men would] spend many a night in bed together talking their hearts out, without the issue of sex arising in any way."&lt;ref name=kramer&gt;{{Citation|last=Kramer|first=Larry|title=Queer Theory's Heist of Our History|journal=Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|year=2011|volume=16|issue=5|url=http://www.glreview.com/article.php?articleid=166|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215092327/http://www.glreview.com/article.php?articleid=166|archivedate=15 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kramer does not agree with this theory and believes that the notion the same-sex sexual relationships and experiences existed. Relatedly, educator and writer [[John D'Emilio|John D’Emilio]] argues that gay identity has not always existed and the emergence of gay men and lesbian was rather a later development associated with the spread of capitalism in the 19th century. A capitalist system of free labor propagated in society and the independent unit of the nuclear family no longer became a necessary economical unit. As the family in turn took on a new role as an emotional and affective unit and separated from the world of work and production, the idea of sexuality separated from that of procreation. Sexuality, no longer bound by the imperative of reproduction, experienced a change and allowed people to think differently about desire, thus creating conditions allowing for the expression of homosexual behavior and the construction of a gay identity.&lt;ref&gt;D’Emilio, J. (1983). Capitalism and gay identity. ''Families in the US: Kinship and domestic politics'', 131-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that queer theory, in part because it typically has recourse to a very technical jargon, is written by a narrow elite for that narrow elite. It is therefore class biased and also, in practice, only really known and referenced at universities and colleges (Malinowitz, 1993).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt; In addition, those in a position of power, have access to modes of communication where they can express their interpretation, definitions and descriptions of topics, sometimes regardless of the accuracy. This persons of power are given “privileged act of naming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooks | first1 = Bell | year = 1991 | title = Theory as liberatory practice | url = | journal = Yale Journal of Law and Feminism | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this can obscure the perception of reality for those in institutionalized settings. Academia often neglects works of theory by women or men of color. This can be attributed to the fact that institutions have imposed standards of critical evaluations for what is a work of theory and what is not. These standards have led to appropriation of work that was deemed unfit and have created a stark exclusion of people who can access the material. This turns the mass public against the idea of understanding theory; an important aspect in relation to understanding practice. The institutionalization of queer theory has imposed a threat of taming and domesticating critical energy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

An initial criticism on queer theory is that precisely "queer" does not refer to any specific sexual status or gender object choice. For example, Halperin (1995)&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt;  allows that straight persons may be "queer," which some believe, robs gays and lesbians of the distinctiveness of what causes them to be marginalized. It desexualizes identity, when the issue is precisely about a sexual identity (Jagose, 1996).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt; On the other hand, Michael Warner argues that the objective of queer is to challenge normalness not heterosexuality. This ties back into Cohen's point about the power dichotomy. Straight persons can be oppressed for behaviors that are seen as sexually deviant as well. One example is the “welfare queen,” a woman of color who is marginalized for her race, sexuality and gender—all identities which intersect to create this kind of oppression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The critique of queer theory is not limited to the US. Queer theory was repeatedly criticized by the Vatican. Pope Francis spoke about "ideological colonization" by which he meant that queer theory, and more broadly critical gender studies, threatens traditional family and fertile heterosexuality. France was one of the first countries where this claim became widespread when catholic movements marched in the streets of Paris against the bill on gay marriage and adoption. [[Bruno Perreau]] in [http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=27481 Queer Theory: The French Response] &lt;ref&gt;Queer Theory: The French Response, Stanford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that this fear has deep historical roots in France. He argues that the rejection of queer theory expresses anxieties about national identity and minority politics. Minority groups could betray the nation and prefer transnational identities. Perreau maintains that queer theory shows that being part of a group requires the ability to critique one's own belonging. This is largely unbearable to reactionary movements, Perreau argues, all the more because queer theory is ironically largely based on French theory.

'''Reflective writing''' is an [[analysis|analytical]] practice in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, form, adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the item or incident, thought, feeling, emotion, or situation in his or her life. Many reflective writers keep in mind questions, such as "What did I notice?", "How has this changed me?" or "What might I have done differently?".

Thus, the focus is on writing that is not merely descriptive. The writer revisits the scene to note details and emotions, reflect on meaning, examine what went well or revealed a need for additional learning, and relate what transpired to the rest of life.

Reflective writing is also analyzing the event or idea (thinking in depth and from different [[Point of view (literature)|perspectives]], and trying to explain, often with reference to a model or theory from the subject.)

A '''religious image''', sometimes called a '''votive image''', is a work of [[visual art]] that is representational and has a religious purpose, subject or connection. All major historical religions have made some use of religious images, although their use is strictly controlled and often controversial in many religions, especially [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] ones. General terms associated with religious images include [[cult image]], a term for images, especially in [[sculpture]] which are or have been claimed to be the object of [[religious worship]] in their own right,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and [[icon]] strictly a term for [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious images,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} but often used more widely, in and outside the area of religion.

==Christianity==
{{main|Christian art}}
{{see also|Early Christian art}}
[[Image:Madonna catacomb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fresco]] depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Christ Child]] in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]] in [[Rome]]. This is earliest known image of Mary and the Infant Jesus independent of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] episode. The figure at the left appears to be [[Balaam]] pointing to a star (outside the frame). The star is from {{bibleverse||Numbers|24:17|HE}}.]]

Images flourished within the Christian world, but by the 6th century, [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|certain factions]] arose within the Eastern Church to challenge the use of icons, and in 726-30 they won Imperial support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The [[Byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]] actively destroyed icons in most public places, replacing them with the only religious depiction allowed, [[Christian cross|the cross]]. The [[Iconodules]] (those who favored the veneration of images), on the other hand, argued that icons had always been used by Christians and should continue to be allowed. They further argued that not only should the use of icons be permitted, it was necessary to the Christian faith as a testimony of the [[dogma]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Christ]]. [[Saint John Damascene]] argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Of old God the incorporial and uncircumscribed was not depicted at all. But now that God has appeared in the flesh and lived among men, I make an image of the God who can be seen. I do not worship matter, but I worship the Creator of matter, who for my sake became material and deigned to dwell in matter, who through matter effected my salvation."&lt;ref&gt;St. John Damascene, ''On the Holy Icons'' ([[Patrologia Graecae]], xciv, 1245A)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, after much debate at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], held in 787, the Iconodules, supported by the Empress, upheld the use of icons as an integral part of Christian [[Sacred tradition|tradition]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, and the Western Church, which had been almost totally unaffected by the dispute, confirmed this.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} According to the definition of the council, icons of Jesus are not intended to depict his divinity, but only the [[Logos|Incarnate Word]]. Saints are depicted because they reflect the grace of God, as depicted by their [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]].

===Eastern Christianity===
{{Main|Icon}}
[[Image:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Christ Pantokrator]] ([[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Mount Sinai]]).]]
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] fully ascribes to the teachings of the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] and celebrates the restoration of the use of icons after the period of Iconoclasm on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]]. So important are the icons in Orthodox theology that the ceremony celebrating their restoration is known as the [[Triumph of Orthodoxy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the traditions of [[Eastern Christianity]], only flat images or ''[[bas relief]]'' images are used (no more than 3/4 [[relief]]). Because the Eastern Church teaches that icons should represent the spiritual reality rather than the physical reality, the traditional style of Orthodox iconography was developed in which figures were stylized in a manner that emphasized their holiness rather than their humanity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Traditional icons differ from Western art in that they are not romantic or emotional, but call the viewer to "sobriety" (''[[nipsis]]''). The manner of depicting the face, and especially the eyes, is intended to produce in the viewer a sense of calm, devotion, and a desire for [[asceticism]]. Icons also differ from Western art in that they use [[inverse perspective]] (giving the impression that the icon itself is the source of light), and for this reason make very little use of shadow or highlight. The background of icons is usually covered with [[gold leaf]] to remind the viewer that the subject pictured is not earthly but otherworldly (gold being the closest earthly medium in which to signify heavenly glory).

[[Image:Eglise de Bethanie, peintures murales.jpg|thumb|left|Drawings made from [[icon]] murals in Betania [[Monastery]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], exemplifying classical Orthodox iconography.]]

Jesus and the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] are depicted wearing the robes of [[philosopher]]s. The precise manner of depicting the face of Jesus and many of the saints is also fixed by tradition. Even the colours used in depicting the clothing of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and other saints is fixed by tradition, with symbolic meaning attached to each color.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Icons of Jesus depict him with a halo that displays three bars of a cross and the Greek letters which signify [[YHWH|I AM]] (the Divine Name which God revealed to [[Moses]] at the [[Burning Bush]]). The halos of saints, even the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God) are usually simple circles, filled with gold leaf. Over the centuries, painter's manuals have developed to help preserve the traditions and techniques of Orthodox iconography, one of the best-known is the manual from the [[Stroganov School]] of iconography in Russia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Despite these strict guidelines, the Orthodox iconographic style is not stilted, and the individual artist is always permitted to bring his own style and spiritual insight into his work, so long as he remains faithful to [[Sacred Tradition]], and many icons display remarkable movement and depth.

The thoughtful use of symbolism allows the icon to present complex teaching in a simple way, making it possible to educate even the illiterate in theology. The interiors of Orthodox Churches are often completely covered in icons of Christ, Mary and the saints.  Most are portrait figures in various conventional poses, but many narrative scenes are also depicted.  It is not unusual in narrative icons for the same individual to be depicted more than one time.

[[Image:Frescos in St. Georges church in Qakh, Azerbaijan 1.jpg|thumb|[[Sacred Tradition]] determines not only the style of representation, but also the traditional placement of icons in an Orthodox church (Georgian Orthodox Church of St. George in [[Qax]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]

Orthodox Christians do not pray "to" icons; rather, they pray "before" them. An icon is a medium of communication, rather than a medium of art. Gazing at an icon is intended to help draw the worshipper into the heavenly kingdom. As with all of Orthodox theology, the purpose is ''[[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]]'' (mystical union with God).{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Icons are [[veneration|venerated]] by the faithful by [[poklon|bowing]] and kissing them. Traditionally, the faithful would not kiss the face of the one depicted on the icon, but rather the right hand or foot depicted on the icon. The composition of an icon is planned with this veneration in mind, and the iconographer will usually portray his subject so that the right hand is raised in blessing, or if it is the saint's full figure is depicted, the right foot is visible.

Icons are also honored with [[thurible|incense]] and by burning [[lampada]]s (oil lamps) in front of them. Icons are carried in [[procession]]s, and the [[bishop]] or [[priest]] may [[blessing|bless]] the people by holding an icon upright and making the [[sign of the cross]] with it over them.

===Western Christianity===
[[File:Interior, All Saints Church, Bolton - geograph.org.uk - 428400.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom, in its current form, in the parish church of [[Bolton, Cumbria|Bolton]] in [[Cumbria]], [[England]].]]
Until the 13th century, icons followed a broadly similar pattern in West and East, although very few such early examples survive from either tradition.  Western icons, which are not usually so termed, were largely patterned on Byzantine works, and equally conventional in composition and depiction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  From this point on the Western tradition came slowly to allow the artist far more flexibility, and a more realistic approach to the figures.

In the 15th century the use of icons in the West was enormously increased by the introduction of [[old master print|prints]] on [[paper]], mostly [[woodcut]]s which were produced in vast numbers.  With the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], after an initial uncertainty among early [[Lutherans]], [[Protestants]] came down firmly against icon-like portraits, especially larger ones, even of Christ.  Many Protestants found these [[Idolatry|idolatrous]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Catholics maintained and even intensified the traditional use of icons, both printed and on paper, using the different styles of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]].  Popular Catholic imagery to a certain extent has remained attached to a [[Baroque painting|Baroque style]] of about 1650, especially in [[Italy]] and [[Spain]].

In the [[Church of England]], the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms of the United Kingdom]] has been used like an icon, owing to its absence of human portraiture, as a representation of the sovereign as Head of the Church. It has been done in wood and stone as well as painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasler|first=Charles|title=The Royal Arms – Its Graphic And Decorative Development| publisher=Jupiter|date=1980|pages=87,93,97}} Retrieved 29 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{expand section|date=November 2011}}
[[Image:Murudeshwar shiva.JPG|thumb|The [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]]. Note the ''[[damaru]]'' drum held in his back hand.]] {{Main|Hindu iconography}}
Images of [[Hindu gods]] and goddesses use a rich [[symbol]]ism. Some figures are blue-skinned (the color of [[heaven]]) or have multiple arms holding various symbols which depict aspects of the god.

==Islam==
{{See also|Islamic art}}
[[Muslims]] view sanctified icons as idols, and strictly forbid their worship, nor do they pray in front of one.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  However, the various [[divisions of Islam]] take different positions on the role of visual depictions of living (or once-living) creatures, including people.  At one end of the spectrum, sects such as the [[Wahhabi]]s totally ban drawings and photography.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Some branches of Islam forbid only the former but allow the latter.  The majority of [[Sunni]] Muslims permit both.  Some [[Shia]] allow even [[Depictions of Muhammad|the depiction of]] [[Muhammad]] and the [[twelve Imams]], a position totally unacceptable to most Sunnis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Judaism==
It is commonly thought that the [[Judaism|Jews]] absolutely prohibit "[[Idolatry|graven images]]"; this, however, is not entirely true. There are numerous instances within [[Torah|the scriptures]] that describe the creation and use of images for religious purposes (the angels on the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the bronze snake [[Moses]] mounted on a pole, etc.). What is important to note is that none of these are worshipped as [[God]]. Since God is incorporeal and has no form, He cannot be depicted.  During the Late Antique period of [[Jewish history]] it is clear that restrictions on representation were relaxed considerably; for example, the synagogue at [[Dura Europas]] had large figurative wall paintings{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  It is also clear there was a tradition of painted [[scroll]]s, of which the [[Joshua Roll]] and the [[Utrecht Psalter]] are medieval Christian copies, none of the originals having survived{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  There are also many medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s, especially of the [[Haggadah of Pesach]] ([[Passover]]).

A unique Jewish tradition of animal iconography was developed in Eastern Europe, which included symbolic depictions of God's attributes and powers as various animal scenes and plant ornaments in the [[wooden synagogues]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth]], as well as some mystical imagery on the gravestones. A part of the same imagery also appears on the [[Ashkenazic]] [[Shiviti|Shivisi]] - meditative images used for contemplation over God's name, not unlike the Eastern [[Mandala]]s.

Some synagogue wall paintings contained over 80 various animals, including lions, [[unicorn]]s, [[dragon]]s, lion-headed mermaids, [[three hares]], three intertwined fishes, [[Uroboros]], elephants, deer, leopards, bears, foxes, wolves, squirrels, turkeys, ostriches and many others.

God himself was usually represented as a two-headed golden eagle in the center of the Sun, painted on the ceiling of the synagogue, and surrounded by the Zodiac circle. This system was based on the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] symbolic tradition; unfortunately, the meaning of some forgotten symbols is hard to recover.

[[Thomas Hubka]] has traced the style of decorative painting in the wooden synagogues to the medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts of Ashkenazi Jewry, and its meaning to the Jewish mystical literature, such as the [[Zohar]] and the works of Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]].&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Themes in the Wall-Paintings of 17th and 18th-Century Polish Wooden Synagogues," by Thomas C. Hubka, p. 213 ff. in ''Imagining the Self, Imagining the Other: Visual Representation and Jewish-Christian Dynamics in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, edited By Eva Frojmovic, BRILL, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punch.jpg|thumb|1867 edition of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', a ground-breaking [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] magazine of popular humour, including a great deal of satire of the contemporary, social, and political scene.]] {{Literature}}{{Performing arts}}
'''Satire''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]], and sometimes [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive [[social criticism]], using [[wit]] to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.

A feature of satire is strong [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]—"in satire, irony is militant"{{Refn | {{Citation | author-link = Northrop Frye | first = Northrop | last = Frye | title = quote}}{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} (literary critic).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Criticism|last=Frye|first=Northrup|publisher=Princeton UP|year=1957|isbn=0-691-06004-5|location=Princeton|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but [[parody]], [[burlesque (literary)|burlesque]], [[exaggeration]],&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"/&gt; juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This "militant" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.

Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including [[internet meme]]s, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.

==Etymology and roots ==

The word satire comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''satur'' and the subsequent phrase ''[[wikt:satura#Latin|lanx satura]].'' ''Satur'' meant "full" but the juxtaposition with ''lanx'' shifted the meaning to "miscellany or medley": the expression ''lanx satura'' literally means "a full dish of various kinds of fruits".&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore D | last = Kharpertian | contribution = Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire | pages = 25–7 | editor-last = Kharpertian | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC | title = A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''satura'' as used by [[Quintilian]], however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed [[hexameter]] form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as ''satire''.&lt;ref name="Kharpertian" /&gt;{{Sfn | Branham | 1997 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&amp;pg=PR24 xxiv]}} Quintilian famously said that ''satura,'' that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (''satura tota nostra est''). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be [[Aristophanes' Old Comedy]]. The first critic to use the term "satire" in the modern broader sense was [[Apuleius]].&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"/&gt;

To Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:
{{quote | As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension; and satura (which had had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for “satyr” (satyros) and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English “satire” comes from the Latin satura; but "satirize", "satiric", etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies 'a satirist in prose' ('satyricus scriptor in prosa').  Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England, by the 16th century, it was written 'satyre.'{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}}}}

The word ''satire'' derives from ''satura'', and its origin was not influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of the ''[[satyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[Renaissance]] confusion of the two origins encouraged a satire more aggressive than that of its Roman forebearers | first = BL | last = Ullman | title = Satura and Satire | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | year = 1913 | jstor = 262450 | doi = 10.1086/359771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, philologist [[Isaac Casaubon]] was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Szabari (2009) ''Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QJLqEwvb0C&amp;pg=PA2 p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humour==
{{rquote|right|The rules of satire are such that it must do more than make you laugh. No matter how amusing it is, it doesn't count unless you find yourself wincing a little even as you chuckle.&lt;ref name="galaxy196806"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Laughter]] is not an essential component of satire;{{Sfn | Corum | 2002 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA175 175]}} in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be "funny" at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily "satirical", even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and [[burlesque]].

Even light-hearted satire has a serious "after-taste": the organizers of the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] describe this as "first make people laugh, and then make them think".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://improbable.com/ig/ | title = Improbable | contribution = Ig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satire and [[irony]] in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of [[social study]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt; They provide the keenest insights into a group's [[Collective unconscious|collective psyche]], reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society's structures of power.&lt;ref name="Deloria69p146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash1970p203"/&gt; Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babcock1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppola"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jo | last = Coppola | title = Comedy on Television | publisher = Commonweal | date = 12 December 1958 | page = 288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a prominent example from [[ancient Greece]], philosopher [[Plato]], when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="Willi2003p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg1962p39"/&gt;

Historically, satire has satisfied the popular [[need]] to [[debunk]] and [[Ridiculous|ridicule]] the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; Satire confronts [[public discourse]] and the [[collective imaginary]], playing as a public opinion counterweight to power (be it political, economic, religious, symbolic, or otherwise), by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satire's job is to expose problems and contradictions, and it's not obligated to solve them.&lt;ref name="WieseForbes2010p.xv"/&gt; [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"/&gt;

For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; Institutions like the [[ritual clown]]s, by giving expression to the [[antisocial tendencies]], represent a [[safety valve]] which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the [[collective imaginary]], which are jeopardized by the [[Social repression|repressive aspects of society]].&lt;ref name="Cazeneuve1957p244"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durand1984p106"/&gt;

The state of [[political satire]] in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it,&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; and the state of [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]]. Under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the [[Soviet Union]] where the [[dissidents]], such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was allowed, the most prominent satirist being [[Arkady Raikin]], political satire existed in the form of [[anecdote]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://samlib.ru/j/jacko_w_a/anecdotes.shtml | last = Yatsko | first = V | title = Russian folk funny stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially [[Brezhnev]], famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.

==Classifications==
Satire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric "modes".&lt;ref&gt;Corum (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA163 p.163]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Worcester (1968) [https://books.google.com/books?id=foUbAQAAIAAJ ''The Art of Satire''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horatian, Juvenalian, Menippean===
[[File:Satire (Orazio) - pag. 12.JPG|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;"Le satire e l'epistole di Q. Orazio Flacco", printed in 1814.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or [[Menippean satire|Menippean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Rolf Arnold|title=Komik und Satire|year=1973|publisher=Juris-Verlag|location=Zürich|isbn=978-3-260-03570-8 | language = German |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horatian====
Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and "philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece" (Rankin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-horatian-satire.htm|title=What Is Horatian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of "gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings" (Drury).&lt;ref name=nku.edu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nku.edu/~rkdrury/422/satire_terms.html|title=Satire Terms|work=nku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  authorlink = Raja Sharma | first = Raja | last = Sharma | title = [["Comedy" in New Light-Literary Studies]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A Horatian satirist's goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile.&lt;ref name=nku.edu/&gt; A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, "In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways." [[Alexander Pope]] has been established as an author whose satire "heals with morals what it hurts with wit" (Green).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/honors-and-the-schools/houston-teachers-institute/curriculum-units/pdfs/2008/comedy/green-08-comedy.pdf|title=The Golden Age of Satire: Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift|author=Patricia, Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Pope—and Horatian satire—attempt to teach.

====Juvenalian====
{{See also|Satires of Juvenal}}
Juvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist [[Juvenal]] (late first century – early second century AD), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. "He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-juvenalian-satire.htm|title=What Is Juvenalian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenal satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.

Following in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.&lt;br /&gt;A Juvenal satirist's goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/satire/|title=Satire Examples and Definition|work=Literary Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Juvenal satirist mocks "societal structure, power, and civilization" (Thomas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/satire-in-literature-definition-types-examples.html|title=Satire in Literature: Definition, Types &amp; Examples|work=Education Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent's reputation and/or power. [[Jonathan Swift]] has been established as an author who "borrowed heavily from Juvenal's techniques in [his critique] of contemporary English society" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com" /&gt;

===Satire versus teasing===
In the [[history of theatre]] there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on [[politics]] and relevant issue, between satire and [[grotesque]] on one side, and [[jest]] with [[teasing]] on the other.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt; [[Max Eastman]] defined the [[spectrum]] of satire in terms of "degrees of biting", as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and "kidding" at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Max Eastman | first = Max | last = Eastman | year = 1936 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tyd5wwn8acwC&amp;pg=PA236 | title = Enjoyment of Laughter | chapter = IV. Degrees of Biting | pages = 236–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] satirical playwright [[Dario Fo]] pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (''sfottò'').&lt;ref name="Lorch1997p128"&gt;{{Citation | author1-link = Dario Fo | first1 = Dario | last1 = Fo | first2 = Jennifer | last2 = Lorch | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u12fXi_HDO4C&amp;pg=PA128 | title = Dario Fo | page = 128 | quote = In other writings Fo makes an important distinction between ''sfottò'' and satire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasing is the [[reactionary]] side of the [[comic]]; it limits itself to a shallow [[parody]] of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a [[subversive]] character, and a [[moral]] dimension which draws judgement against its targets.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990pn" /&gt;{{Refn | name = "Arroyop303" | {{Citation | first1 = José Luís Blas | last1 = Arroyo | first2 = Mónica Velando | last2 = Casanova | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CxZ_zH44PVkC&amp;pg=PA303 | title = Discurso y sociedad: contribuciones al estudio de la lengua en... | volume = 1 | pages = 303–4}} }}&lt;ref name = "Morson1988p114"&gt;{{Citation | last = Morson | first = Gary Saul | year = 1988 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PpLiINhO83MC&amp;pg=PA114 | title = Boundaries of Genre | page = 114 | quote = second, that parodies can be, as Bakhtin observes, "shallow" as well as "deep" (''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'', 160), which is to say, directed at superficial as well as fundamental faults of the original. [...] the distinction between shallow and deep [...] [is] helpful in understanding the complex ways in which parodies are used. For instance, shallow parody is sometimes used to pay an author an indirect compliment. The opposite of damning with faint praise, this parody with faint criticism may be designed to show that no more fundamental criticism ''could'' be made.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo formulated an [[Operational definition|operational]] criterion to tell real satire from ''sfottò'', saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | year = 2005 | url = http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/147 | archivedate = December 25, 2005 | place = [[Italy|IT]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051225171452/http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node%2F147 | title = Matrix | quote = Dario Fo disse a Satyricon: —La satira vera si vede dalla reazione che suscita. | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;

Teasing (''sfottò'') is an ancient form of simple [[buffoonery]], a form of comedy without satire's subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impersonation]] of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, [[tic]]s, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with [[irony]]; it never harms the target's conduct, [[ideology]] and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;{{Refn | name="Arroyop303"}} ''Sfottò'' directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | language = Italian | url = http://www.nazioneindiana.com/2003/10/28/state-a-casa-a-fare-i-compiti-2/ | title = State a casa a fare i compiti | format = interview | editor1-first = Federica | editor1-last = Fracassi | editor2-first = Jacopo | editor2-last = Guerriero | journal = Nazione Indiana |date=October 2003 | quote = Lo sfottò è reazionario.

===Classifications by topics===
Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], the primary topics of literary satire have been [[politics]], [[religion]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdie Addis (2012) ''Qual è il tuo "tallone da killer"?'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKysGIQV4SgC&amp;pg=PT20 p.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while [[religious satire]] is that which targets [[religious belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p39"/&gt; Satire on sex may overlap with [[blue comedy]], [[off-color humor]] and [[dick joke]]s.

[[Scatology]] has a long literary association with satire,&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; as it is a classical mode of the [[grotesque]], the [[grotesque body]] and the satiric grotesque.&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andries2000p10"/&gt; [[Shit]] plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes [[death]], the turd being "the ultimate dead object".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human [[excrement]], exposes their "inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1993p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duprat1982p178"/&gt; The [[ritual clown]]s of [[clown societies]], like among the [[Pueblo Indians]], have ceremonies with [[Coprophagia|filth-eating]].&lt;ref name="Parsons34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyers96"/&gt; In other cultures, [[sin-eating]] is an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] rite in which the sin-eater (also called filth-eater),&lt;ref&gt;Donald Alexander Mackenzie (1923) ''Myths of Pre-Columbian America'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6chKHROa1icC&amp;pg=PA229 p.229]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Marnham (2000) ''Dreaming with His Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=pcddElQo9JkC&amp;pg=PA297 p.297]&lt;/ref&gt; by ingesting the food provided, takes "upon himself the sins of the departed".&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"/&gt; Satire about death overlaps with [[black humor]] and [[gallows humor]].

Another classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners.&lt;ref name="Bloom1979"/&gt; Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. [[Comedy of manners]], sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes.&lt;ref name="Nicoll1951p179"/&gt; Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p189"/&gt;

Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible [[Tone (literature)|tone]]s: [[wit]], [[ridicule]], [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynicism]], the [[sardonic]] and [[invective]].&lt;ref name="Pollard1970p66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1946p32"/&gt;

===Classifications by medium===
Satire is found not only in written literary forms. In [[preliterate culture]]s it manifests itself in [[ritual clown|ritual]] and folk forms, as well as in [[trickster]] tales and [[oral poetry]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

It appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance, [[cartoon strip]]s, and [[graffiti]]. Examples are [[Dada]] sculptures, [[Pop Art]] works, music of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[Erik Satie]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; In modern [[media culture]], [[stand-up comedy]] is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into [[mass media]], challenging [[mainstream]] discourse.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; [[Roast (comedy)|Comedy roast]]s, mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

==Development==

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Satirical papyrus.jpg|thumb|upright=2.25|The satirical papyrus at the British Museum]]
[[File:Cat guarding geese c1120 BC Egypt.jpg|thumb|Satirical ostraca showing a cat guarding geese, c.1120 BC, Egypt.]]
[[File:WLA brooklynmuseum Figured Ostracon Showing a Cat Waiting on a Mouse.jpg|thumb|Figured ostracon showing a cat waiting on a mouse, Egypt]]
One of the earliest examples of what we might call satire, [[The Satire of the Trades]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = M | last = Lichtheim | title = Ancient Egyptian Literature | volume = I | year = 1973 | pages = 184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The text's apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Helck | title = Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj | publisher = Wiesbaden | year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; think that the context was meant to be serious.

The [[Papyrus Anastasi I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alan H | last = Gardiner | title = Egyptian Hieratic Texts | series= I: Literary Texts of the New Kingdom | volume = I | place = Leipzig | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (late 2nd millennium BC) contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the reader's meagre knowledge and achievements.

===Ancient Greece===
The Greeks had no word for what later would be called "satire", although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the [[Greek comedy|Greek playwright]] [[Aristophanes]] one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and [[societal commentary]],&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = DF | title = Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations | place = New York | year = 1993 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for the [[political satire]] by which he criticized the powerful [[Cleon]] (as in ''[[The Knights]]''). He is also notable for the persecution he underwent.&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aristophanes003.html | chapter = Political and social satires of Aristophanes | editor-first = Alfred | editor-last = Bates | title = The Drama, Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization | volume = 2 | place = London | publisher = Historical Publishing | year = 1906 | pages = 55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JE | last = Atkinson | jstor = 639144 | title = Curbing the Comedians: Cleon versus Aristophanes and Syracosius' Decree | journal = The Classical Quarterly | series = New | volume = 42 | number = 1 | year = 1992 | pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1017/s0009838800042580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | title = Aristophanes: the Michael Moore of his Day | first = John Louis | last = Anderson | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019054115/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | archivedate = October 19, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes' plays turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}} His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian [[Menander]]. His early play ''Drunkenness'' contains an attack on the politician [[Callimedon]].

The oldest form of satire still in use is the [[Menippean satire]] by [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]]. His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of [[wikt:diatribe|diatribe]]. As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}}

===Roman world===
The first Roman to discuss satire critically was [[Quintilian]], who invented the term to describe the writings of [[Gaius Lucilius]]. The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], who wrote during the early days of the [[Roman Empire]]. Other important satirists in ancient [[Latin]] are Gaius Lucilius and [[Persius]]. ''Satire'' in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized [[Augustus]], he used [[veil]]ed ironic terms. In contrast, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that the 6th-century-BC poet [[Hipponax]] wrote ''satirae'' that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cuddon | title = Dictionary of Literary Terms | place = Oxford | year = 1998 | contribution = Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian]] wrote ''[[True History]]'', a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by [[Ctesias]], [[Iambulus]], and [[Homer]]. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like they, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''.

===Medieval Islamic world===
{{main|Arabic literature#Satire and comedy|Persian satire|l1=Arabic satire}}
Medieval [[Arabic poetry]] included the satiric genre ''hija''. Satire was introduced into [[Arabic literature|Arabic prose literature]] by the [[Afro-Arab]] author [[Al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], [[Sociology in medieval Islam|sociology]] and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, "based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry."{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 32}} For example, in one of his [[Zoology|zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia | first1 = Ulrich | last1 = Marzolph | first2 = Richard | last2 = van Leeuwen| first3 = Hassan | last3 = Wassouf | publisher = ABC-CLIO| year = 2004 | isbn= 1-57607-204-5|pages=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| pp = 77–8}} An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as "a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term "Farazdaq-like" as a form of political satire.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 70}}

The terms "[[comedy]]" and "satire" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain |first=Edwin J |last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/470561| jstor=470561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ubayd Zakani]] introduced satire in [[Persian literature]] during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving [[homosexual]] practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' ("Ethics of the Aristocracy") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of [[Persian literature]]. Between 1905 and 1911, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.

===Medieval Europe===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], examples of satire were the songs by [[Goliard]]s or [[Clerici vagantes|vagant]]s now best known as an anthology called [[Carmina Burana]] and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer [[Carl Orff]]. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the [[High Middle Ages]] and the birth of modern [[vernacular literature]] in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by [[Chaucer]]. The disrespectful manner was considered "unchristian" and ignored, except for the '''moral satire''', which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are ''[[Livre des Manières]]'' by {{ill|Étienne de Fougères|fr}} (~1178), and some of Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Sometimes [[Epic poetry|epic poetry (epos)]] was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.

===Early modern western satire===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind - WGA3511.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s 1568 satirical painting ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]''.]]
Direct [[social commentary]] via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of [[François Rabelais]] tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).

Two major satirists of [[Europe]] in the [[Renaissance]] were [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[François Rabelais]]. Other examples of Renaissance satire include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools|Narrenschiff]]'' (1494), [[Erasmus]]'s ''[[Moriae Encomium]]'' (1509), [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), and ''[[Carajicomedia]]'' (1519).'''

The [[Elizabethan]] (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan "satire" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French [[Huguenot]] [[Isaac Casaubon]] pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the "dishfull of fruits") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the "amendment of vices" ([[Dryden]]).

In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Hall]]'s ''Virgidemiarum'', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although [[John Donne|Donne]] had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model.{{Sfn | Hall | 1969 | ps =: ‘Hall's ''Virgidemiae'' was a new departure in that the true Juvenalian mode of satire was being attempted for the first time, and successfully, in English.’}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, the censors of the press, issued Orders to the Stationers' Company on June 1 and 4, 1599, prohibiting the further printing of satires—the so-called 'Bishop's Ban'.{{Sfn | Davenport | 1969}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}}}}

===Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:A Welch wedding. Satire c.1780.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'A Welch wedding' Satirical Cartoon c.1780]]
The [[Age of Enlightenment]], an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the [[Tory]] and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the [[Scriblerus Club]], which included [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, "an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century | volume = 3 | page = 435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting "juvenal" satire.&lt;ref name="Weinbrot2007p136"&gt;Weinbrot, Howard D. (2007) ''Eighteenth-Century Satire: Essays on Text and Context from Dryden to Peter...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHADZOHbJ2QC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Swift]] was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the "problem" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. [[John Dryden]] wrote an influential essay entitled "A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/drydendiscourse2.html | editor-first = Jack | editor-last = Lynch | publisher = Rutgers | last = Dryden | first = John | title = Discourse | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' was written in response to a rivalry with [[Thomas Shadwell]] and eventually inspired [[Alexander Pope]] to write his satirical ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Other satirical works by Pope include the ''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]''.

[[Alexander Pope]] (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Famous throughout and after the [[Long eighteenth century|long 18th century]], Pope died in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-pope-9444371#synopsis|title=Biography of Alexander Pope § Synopsis|work=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope, in his ''The Rape of the Lock'', is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. ''The Rape of the Lock'' assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the ''Iliad'', which Pope was translating at the time of writing ''The Rape of the Lock''. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/545/satire-in-18th-century-british-society-alexander-popes-the-rape-of-the-lock-and-jonathan-swifts-a-modest-proposal|title=Satire in 18th Century British Society: Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'' and Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal''|year=2011|journal=Student Pulse|volume=3|issue=06|author=Jonathan J.

[[Daniel Defoe]] pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' which mocks [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] patriotism, and ''[[The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters]]''—advocating [[religious toleration]] by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is a precursor to the development of [[political cartoons]] in 18th-century England.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwzWAAAAMAAJ|title=The Political Cartoon|author=Charles Press|year=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, [[James Gillray]] from London.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray's wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent [[cartoonist]] of the era.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ebenezer Cooke (poet)|Ebenezer Cooke]] (1665–1732), author of "The Sot-Weed Factor" (1708), was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire. [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.

===Satire in Victorian England===
[[File:DV257 no.19 The donkey race.png|thumb|A Victorian satirical sketch depicting a gentleman's donkey race in 1852]]
Several satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) and [[Edwardian]] period, such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1841) and ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' (1861).

Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the [[Savoy Opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In fact, in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:
:''"I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,
:''The upstart I can wither with a whim;
:''He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,
:''But his laughter has an echo that is grim!"

Novelists such as [[Charles Dickens]] (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.

Continuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, [[Sidney Godolphin Osborne]] (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing "Letters to the Editor" of the [[London Times]]. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the [[Junius]] letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric "Letters to the Editor" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from [[Parliament]]'s then Home Secretary Sir [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose|James Graham]]. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the [[New Poor Laws]] and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the [[Irish Famine]] and its mistreatment of soldiers during the [[Crimean War]].

Later in the nineteenth century, in the United States, [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) is set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the "sinful temptation" that leads him to help a runaway [[Slavery|slave]]. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.

Twain's younger contemporary [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842–1913) gained notoriety as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the [[American Civil War]], which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, [[hypocrisy]] and [[Appeal to tradition|received wisdom]].

===20th-century satire===
[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is considered the first major European satirist since [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"&gt;Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] (1930s) and [[George Orwell]] (1940s), which under the inspiration of [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s Russian 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that "one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand [[syllogism]]s" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] was known for his satirical stories such as ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920), ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) by [[Charlie Chaplin]] is itself a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"&gt;Chaplin (1964) ''My Autobiography'', p.392, quotation: {{quotation|Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|Benzino Napaloni and [[Adenoid Hynkel]] in ''The Great Dictator'' (1940). Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"/&gt;]]
In the United States 1950s, satire was introduced into American [[stand-up comedy]] most prominently by [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Mort Sahl]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; As they challenged the [[taboo]]s and [[conventional wisdom]] of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as ''[[sick comedian]]s''. In the same period, [[Paul Krassner]]'s magazine ''[[The Realist]]'' began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. This baton was also carried by the original [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] magazine, edited by [[Doug Kenney]] and [[Henry Beard]] and featuring blistering satire written by [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[P.J. O'Rourke]], and [[Tony Hendra]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/funny-pages-how-the-national-lampoon-made-american-humor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent satiric stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] acknowledged the influence ''The Realist'' had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2010p94"&gt;Sullivan, James (2010) ''Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3dzVQ5wX9UC&amp;pg=PA94 p.94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Carlin]] (2002) ''[http://paulkrassner.com/carlinintro.htm Introduction]'' to ''Murder At the Conspiracy Convention''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the [[satire boom]], led by such luminaries as [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]], whose stage show ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include [[David Frost]], [[Eleanor Bron]] and the [[television program]] ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/14/david-frost-satire-documentary "David Frost's Q&amp;A on how to be a satirist"]. ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved February 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heller]]'s most famous work, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961), satirizes bureaucracy and the military, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22?

===Contemporary satire===
Contemporary popular usage of the term "satire" is often very imprecise. While satire often uses [[caricature]] and [[parody]], by no means all uses of these or other humorous devices are satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article.

[[File:Spitting Image Puppet of Eric Cantona (2956625432).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Puppet of Manchester United striker [[Eric Cantona]] from the British satirical puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'']]
Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as ''[[Mock the Week]]'' (2005) and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' (1990–ongoing). It is found on radio quiz shows such as ''[[The News Quiz]]'' (1977–ongoing) and ''[[The Now Show]]'' (1998–ongoing).

The television program ''[[South Park]]'' (1997–ongoing) relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture, with episodes addressing [[The Passion of the Jew|anti-Semitism]], [[Go God Go|militant atheism]], [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride|homophobia]], [[Rainforest Shmainforest|environmentalism]], [[Gnomes (South Park)|corporate culture]], [[The Death Camp of Tolerance|political correctness]] and [[Red Hot Catholic Love|anti-Catholicism]], among many other issues.

Australian [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] produces comedy art in the style of mockumentaries (''[[We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year|We Can Be Heroes]]'', ''[[Summer Heights High]]'', ''[[Angry Boys]]'') and his work is often described as complex social satire.

[[File:Stephen Colbert by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Stephen Colbert]] satirically impersonated an opinionated and self-righteous television commentator on his [[Comedy Central]] program in the U.S.]]
[[Stephen Colbert]]'s television program, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (2005–14), is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire. [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Colbert's character]] is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and "unwittingly" uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.

Other political satire includes various political causes in the past, including the relatively successful [[Polish Beer-Lovers' Party]] and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mollythedog2008.com/ | title = Molly the Dog | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053639/http://mollythedog2008.com/ | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Miner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.brianminer2008.com/ | title = Brian Miner | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist is Sir [[Terry Pratchett]], author of the internationally best-selling ''[[Discworld]]'' book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], co-writer and director of ''[[Four Lions]]''.

In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization ''[[Canada News Network]]'' provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter [[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].

Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, "We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny – ''Time'' |publisher=Time.com |date=September 29, 1947 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]], caricatured in his comic strip as "Simple J. Malarky". [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the "exquisite agony" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.

Like some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and [[caricature]]; for instance, the popular animated series ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park'' both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.

[[News satire]] is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. ''[[The Onion]]'', ''[[Canada News Network]]'', ''[[Private Eye]]''), "Not Your Homepage,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notyourhomepage.com/|title=Not Your Homepage – Check Your Morals At The Door, Come See the Internet Lore!|work=notyourhomepage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio (e.g. ''[[On the Hour]]''), television (e.g. ''[[The Day Today]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'') and the web (e.g. [[Mindry.in]], The Fruit Dish, [[Scunt News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |title=FRONT PAGE – Satirical News, Review, Comment &amp; Analysis |publisher=Scunt.co.uk |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421054837/http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |archivedate=April 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faking News]], [[El Koshary Today]], The Giant Napkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegiantnapkin.com/ |title=The Giant Napkin |publisher=Thegiantnapkin.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed Sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unconfirmedsources.com/ |title=Unconfirmedsources.com |publisher=Unconfirmedsources.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The ''Onion''{{'}}s website). Other satires are on the [[list of satirists and satires]]. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the [[Internet meme]] character [[Miranda Sings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ng | first = David | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-jim-caruso-cast-party-jersey-boys-daniel-reichard.html | title = YouTube sensation Miranda seduces Broadway | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/04/PKGE19REP8.DTL | title = This Week | journal = San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', Sean Mills, President of ''[[The Onion]]'', said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. "It's whatever affects that person", said Mills. "So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.' Or someone else can say, 'Cancer's ''hilarious'', but don't talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it."&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]], a comedian from [[Shanghai]], is the most popular satirist in China. His humour has interested middle-class people and has sold out shows ever since his rise to fame.

==Techniques==
Literary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, [[Reprise#In literature|reprising]] previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice.&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p136"&gt;Griffin, Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exaggeration]] is one of the most common satirical techniques.&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"&gt;Claridge, Claudia (2010) ''Hyperbole in English: A Corpus-based Study of Exaggeration'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aegq_QdX6h8C&amp;pg=PA257 p.257]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily [[Diminution (satire)|diminution]] is also a satirical technique.

==Legal status==
For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; In Germany&lt;ref name="Geisler2005p73"/&gt; and Italy&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; satire is protected by the constitution.

Since satire belongs to the realm of [[art]] and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere [[freedom of information]] of journalistic kind.&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; In some countries a specific "right to satire" is recognized and its limits go beyond the "right to report" of journalism and even the "right to criticize".&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; Satire benefits not only of the protection to [[freedom of speech]], but also to that to [[culture]], and that to scientific and artistic production.&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{Main|The Juice Media#Controversy}}
In September 2017 [[The Juice Media]] received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of a satirical logo, called the "Coat of Harms" based on the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]], no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/billsdgs/5767580%22|title=ParlInfo - Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017 was before the [[Australian Senate]] with the [[Reading (legislature)|third reading]] moved 10 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973#|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and criticism==
Descriptions of satire's biting effect on its target include 'venomous', 'cutting', 'stinging',&lt;ref name="Kinservik2002p21"&gt;Kinservik, Matthew J. (2002) ''Disciplining Satire: The Censorship of Satiric Comedy on the Eighteenth...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=haUcp4-01DMC&amp;pg=PA21 p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; vitriol. Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.

===Typical arguments===
Because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his [[persona]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p10"/&gt;

====Bad taste====
Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]], or that "it's just not funny" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.

====Targeting the victim====
Some critics of [[Mark Twain]] see [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|''Huckleberry Finn'']] as [[racist]] and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in ''Huckleberry Finn'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Leonard | first1 = James S | first2 = Thomas A | last2 = Tenney | first3 = Thadious M | last3 = Davis | title = Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |date=December 1992 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;lpg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Shelley Fisher | last = Fishin | title = Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. The character of [[Alf Garnett]] (played by [[Warren Mitchell]]) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, [[little Englander]] that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of [[anti-hero]] to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with [[Archie Bunker]] in American TV show ''[[All in the Family]]'', a character derived directly from Garnett.)

The Australian satirical television comedy show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the "target" of its attacks. The "Make a Realistic Wish Foundation" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to [[Charitable organization|charities]], was widely interpreted as an attack on the [[Make a Wish Foundation]], or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that The Chaser team "should hang their heads in shame". He went on to say that "I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/04/2589532.htm |title='Hang your heads' Rudd tells Chaser boys | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.

====Romantic prejudice====
The romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]] that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutherland | first = James | year = 1958 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 | title = English Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rod A | last = Martin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ieAcp2Z_zkIC&amp;pg=PA27 | title = The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach | pages = 27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Apte | first = Mahadev L | year = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4fuAAAAAMAAJ | title = Humor and laughter: an anthropological approach | chapter = Introduction | page = 23 | quote = The general neglect of humor as a topic of anthropological research is reflected in teaching practice. Most introductory textbooks do not even list humor as a significant characteristic of cultural systems together with kinship, social roles, behavioral patterns, religion, language, economic transactions, political institutions, values, and material culture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of opposition toward notable satires===
[[File:Emergency Twitter Was Down.jpg|thumb|right|Satire on [[internet culture]]]]
Because satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes [[censorship]] in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, [[Aristophanes]] was persecuted by the [[demagogue]] [[Cleon]].

====1599 book ban====
In 1599, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]] and the [[Bishop of London]] [[Richard Bancroft]], whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in [[England]], issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]], ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's [[Privy Council]], and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554–1640 | volume = III | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Arber | place = London | year = 1875–94 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the [[Martin Marprelate]] controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]], two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.

====21st-century polemics====
In 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many [[wikt:fatality|fatalities]] in the [[Near East]]. It was not the first case of [[Muslim]] protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the [[freedom of speech]], and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]], which was immediately responded to by Jews with an [[Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest]].

In 2006 British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] released ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a "[[mockumentary]]" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and the government of [[Kazakhstan]] boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.

In 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-12-18-zuma-claims-r7m-over-zapiro-cartoon| work = Mail and Guardian | date = December 18, 2008 | location = [[South Africa|ZA]] | title= Zuma claims R7m over Zapiro cartoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape]] in May 2006. In February 2009, the [[SABC|South African Broadcasting Corporation]], viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=248529&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ | work = Mail and Guardian | format = interview | title = Democratic Alliance spokesperson Helen Zille| accessdate = August 2005 | location = ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |work=Dispatch |location=ZA |title=ZNews: Zapiro's puppet show |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326004224/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire (featuring Shapiro among others) for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-05-26-sabc-pulls-zapiro-doccie-again| work = Mail and Guardian | date = September 26, 2009 | location = ZA | title=SABC pulls Zapiro doccie, again}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apartheid South Africa]] also had a long history of censorship.

On April 29, 2015, the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) requested [[Kent Police]] investigate the [[BBC]], claiming that comments made about Party leader [[Nigel Farage]] by a panelist on the comedy show ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' might hinder his chances of success in the general election (which would take place a week later), and claimed the BBC breached the Representation of the People Act.&lt;ref name="UKIP"/&gt; Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, "Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on ''Have I Got News for You'' regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties."&lt;ref name="UKIP"&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-29/ukip-asks-police-to-investigate-the-bbc-over-have-i-got-news-for-you/ "Ukip asks police to investigate the BBC over Have I Got News for You"].

* The 1784 presaging of modern [[daylight saving time]], later actually proposed in 1907.

*In the 1920s, an English [[cartoonist]] imagined a laughable thing for the time: a hotel for cars. He drew a [[multi-story car park]].&lt;ref name="LuttazziProphetic" /&gt;
*The second episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', which debuted in 1969, featured a ''[[Sketch comedy|skit]]'' entitled "[[The Mouse Problem]]" (meant to satirize contemporary media exposés on homosexuality), which depicted a cultural phenomenon eerily similar to modern [[furry fandom]] (which did not become widespread until the 1980s, over a decade after the skit was first aired).
* The comedy film ''[[Americathon]]'', released in 1979 and set in the United States of 1998, predicted a number of trends and events that would eventually unfold in the near future, including an American debt crisis, Chinese [[capitalism]], the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[terrorism]] aimed at the civilian population, a presidential sex scandal, and the popularity of [[reality shows]].
*In January 2001, a satirical news article in ''[[The Onion]]'', entitled "Our Long National Nightmare of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784 |title=Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over' | publisher= The Onion |accessdate= June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; had newly elected President George Bush vowing to "develop new and expensive weapons technologies" and to "engage in at least one Gulf War-level armed conflict in the next four years". Furthermore, he would "bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts, which would lead to a recession". This prophesied the [[Iraq War]] and to the [[Bush tax cuts]].
*In 1975, the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' included an ad for a triple blade razor called the Triple-Trac; in 2001, [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] introduced the Mach3. In 2004, ''[[The Onion]]'' satirized [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] and Gillette's marketing of ever-increasingly multi-blade razors with a mock article proclaiming Gillette will now introduce a five-blade razor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930 |title=Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades |publisher=The Onion |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Gillette released the [[Gillette Fusion]], a five-blade razor.
*After the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]] in 2015, ''[[The Onion]]'' ran an article with the headline "U.S. Soothes Upset Netanyahu With Shipment Of Ballistic Missiles". Sure enough, reports broke the next day of the Obama administration offering military upgrades to Israel in the wake of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.666977 |title=Where Satire Meets Truth: Did The Onion Just Predict a Real Israeli Headline? |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2016, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' released the most recent in a string of satirical references to a potential ''[[Donald Trump]]'' presidency. Other media sources, including the popular film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' have also made similar satirical references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/simpsons-predicted-president-trump-back-to-the-future |title=Back to the future: how the Simpsons and others predicted President Trump |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Di fatto questa è una forma di comicità che non si può chiamare satira, ma solo sfottò. ...

Satire rose the daunting question of what role public opinion would play in government. (...) satirists criticized government activities, exposed ambiguities, and forced administrators to clarify or establish policies. Not surprisingly, heated public controversy surrounded satiric commentary, resulting in an outright ban on political satire in 1835 (...) Government officials cracked down on their humorous public criticism that challenged state authority through both its form and content. Satire had been a political resource in France for a long time, but the anxious political context of the July Monarchy had unlocked its political power.
Satire also taught lessons in democracy. It fit into the July Monarchy's tense political context as a voice in favor of public political debate. Satiric expression took place in the public sphere and spoke from a position of public opinion-that is, from a position of the nation’s expressing a political voice and making claims on its government representatives and leadership. Beyond mere entertainment, satire's humor appealed to and exercised public opinion, drawing audiences into new practices of representative government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheldon Lee Gosline'' is an [[United States|American]] [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who has extensively studied the ancient civilizations of the Far East. He is noted for proposing the existence of a developing literate civilization in southern China dating to the second millennium BCE.

==Biography==
Sheldon Lee Gosline began his professional education at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a B.A. degrees in Oriental Studies and Art History in 1985. He later continued his studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he received a B.A. degree 1988 and was awarded an M.A. degree in Oriental Studies in 1993.
He interrupted his stay at Cambridge to study at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an M.A. degree in Egyptology and Near Eastern Archaeology in 1992.
After Cambridge he studied at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. He received his Ph.D. in 2013 from [[University College London]], where he researched at the [[Wellcome Trust]] Centre for the History of Medicine and the [[UCL Centre for the History of Medicine]]. His thesis concerned the intersection of business and medicine.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYC&gt;[https://www.explorers.org/events/detail/nyc_public_lecture_series_feat_sheldon_gosline ''The Explorers Club''], NYC Public Lecture Series Featuring Sheldon Gosline (8 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gosline is owner of Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts based in Warren Center, PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts|url=http://shangri-la.0catch.com/|publisher=Shangri-La|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.shangri-la.0catch.com|url=http://www.roadurls.com/www.shangri-la.0catch.com|website=Road Url|publisher=Road Url|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline has taught at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; and at UW-Madison. He was at Northeast Normal University through 2004.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; 
In 2011, he moved to London to pursue a Ph.D. in the history of medicine, at [[University College London]]. Once he completed the degree, he returned to China to research the writing of the country’s minority groups.  He was first a visiting professor at [[Minzu University of China]] and [[Tsinghua University]], both in Beijing.  Since 2015, he has taught medical humanities at [[Peking University]]. He is a member of several professional associations.

He states that he has become proficient in or conversant with nine contemporary or ancient languages.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://shangri-la.0catch.com/press/vitae.html] ''Vitae of Prof. Sheldon Lee Gosline'' (shangri-la website; accessed 21 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost civilization theory==
IN 2013 Gosline was shown some inscriptions found in [[Guangxi]] province and considered that several were based on the [[Indus script]] and Persian cuneiform. On a field trip to the area where they were found in 2014 he discovered what he considered evidence of further inscriptions made up of large rocks regularly spaced and what he called “a man-made platform of megalithic construction" and something that “appeared to be a carved chair or throne.”   Sitting on it he “sensed a harmony and that I was in the midst of an ancient time calculating device".&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt; He returned to what he called an "observatory complex" with caver including royal burials in June 2014 with a group of researchers who examined the site and stated that “We confirmed most of the things I’d found as potential alignments, and we confirmed that there was artifact evidence in the area that showed human occupation.” He reported this in a talk to the New York Explorers Club later that year, saying that he believed he had found an unknown civilization. 

Reports from Chinese researchers who accompanied him were less positive. Dr. Ye Xiaohong reported that "Two suspected cave tombs are not man-made," "No artificial traces were found on the huge stone in the suspected artificial remains, neither the suspected structures for observation nor the suspected ancient topographic maps" and that what Gosline had interpreted as ancient writing on some rocks "were certainly produced by natural force".&lt;ref name="Ye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ye|first1=Xiaohong|title=Preliminary Observation and Cognition at Gansang|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0714/46829.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese researchers also surveyed the alignments that Gosline thought related to the chair (which they agreed was a natural water-created formation) and concluded that the stone could not have been used as part of an observatory. &lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Fengxian|title=A Survey of Gansang site and Further Discussion|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46710.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Chinese researcher who was part of Gosline's group stated that "Gosline proclaimed that he had found several megalithic sites including observatories, palaces, and ancient cave tombs，petro-glyphs and even plan maps at Gansang, Nadou, and Bupeng in Pingguo county, Guangxi".  The conclusion was that "We have not found any artificial remains, artifacts, and occupation layer both at Nadou and Bupeng sites" and that most of the "scratches, the petro-glyphs and plan maps on the rocks called by Gosline, are natural" with a few that might be artificial and needed microscopic examination. However they did believe that the "Gansang site might have worked as an important settlement in Youjiang River Reach." Commenting on the engraved stones reported by Gosline, they commented that they seemed too new, that they were too intact with "the whole texts just fit to the sizes of the planks", that they lacked an archaeological context and that there were too few repetitions of characters.&lt;ref name="Nu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nu|first1=He|title=Thinking about the Sites in Pingguo county, S China|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46706.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline’s observation that the newly discovered inscriptions seemed to include Persian cuneiform is unproven as of 2016.&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/did-a-coded-message-lead-an-american-to-a-lost-civilization-in-china?ct=t(Newsletter_4_21_20164_20_2016)&amp;mc_cid=5e86c4b93a&amp;mc_eid=34be11d5e3] Did A Coded Message Lead an American to a Lost Civilization in

The '''Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences''' is the heart of the undergraduate program and grants the majority of [[Stanford University]]'s degrees. The School has 23 departments and
20 interdisciplinary degree-granting programs. The School was officially created in 1948, from the merger of the Schools of Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences.  Those schools date from the mid-1920s when the university first organized individual departments into schools.&lt;ref name=histoverall&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Schools of the University|url=http://histsoc.stanford.edu/su_schools.shtml|publisher=Stanford Historical Society|accessdate=18 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120133812/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/su_schools.shtml|archivedate=20 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==

The school is divided into three divisions: Humanities and Arts, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.

=== Humanities and Arts ===

* Sociology

Stanford was set up with a Political Science department but that was almost immediately renamed Economics and Social Science.  The forerunner of the current Political Science department was established in 1918.

Sociology and Anthropology were originally one department established in 1948.  They split in 1957.  Anthropology itself was split into Anthropological Sciences and Cultural and Social Anthropology from
1999 to 2007 but merged again.

Notable faculty in these departments other than those mentioned above include:
*[[Albert Bandura]] (1925-), David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science 
*[[Carol Dweck]] (1946-), Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology (2004-)

==Core courses==
At times Stanford has required undergraduate students to take core courses in various subjects in the humanities and sciences.  Some of the core courses include
* Western Culture (1980-1988) - freshmen took courses in  both European and non-European cultures with  “a substantial historical dimension” and include works by women and minorities.&lt;ref name=st37-2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomew|first1=Karen|title=25 years ago (1988)|journal=Sandstone &amp; Tile|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://historicalsociety.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST37no1.pdf|page=22|date=2013|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) (2000-2012),&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt; a core freshman  course sequence which consisted of one fall-quarter course followed by a 2-quarter pair of courses during the winter and spring quarters. Fall quarter courses were interdisciplinary while winter-spring focused on a specific disciplinary area.
* Thinking Matters (2012–2016)&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt;

'''The Burrard Street Journal''' (or BSJ) is an online satire news website based in [[Vancouver]], BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/about-burrard-street-journal/ | title= The Burrard Street Journal – (Burrard Street Football) | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site gained notoriety in August 2016 after a number of websites reported a BSJ article about then [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] moving to Canada as fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/obama-moving-to-canada-hoax | last= Silverman | first= Craig | date= 12 August 2016 | title= A Bunch Of Conservative Sites Fell For A Hoax Claiming Obama Will Move To Canada If Trump Wins | website= [[BuzzFeed]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.torontosun.com/2016/08/12/sorry-us-the-jokes-on-you-obama-wont-be-moving-to-canada-if-trump-wins | date= 12 August 2016 | title= Sorry U.S., the joke's on you: Obama won't be moving to Canada if Trump wins | website= [[Toronto Sun]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Burrard Street Journal articles and videos have been reported as real news. In July 2016, an article titled 'Trump Claims America Should Never Have Given Canada Its Independence'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/20/is-trump-trolling-the-white-house-press-corps | last= Marantz | first= Andrew | date= 20 March 2017 | title= Is Trump Trolling the White House Press Corps? | magazine= [[The New Yorker]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shared over 9,000 times and in March 2016, an edited BSJ video reporting [[Donald Trump]] building a wall with Canada was shared over 50,000 times and has received 4.5 million views as of March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | date = 22 March 2016 | title = Breaking News: Donald J.

As a result of the BSJ's [[News satire|satire]] being copied and/or shared as real news, the website's founder, John Egan, has sent copyright infringement notices to more than 100 websites.&lt;ref name="GN"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://globalnews.ca/news/3123282/b-c-satirical-news-website-founder-takes-on-fake-news-sites-that-copied-my-articles/ | last= Azpiri | first= Jon | date= 13 December 2016 | title= B.C. satirical news website founder takes on fake news sites that ‘copied my articles’ | website= [[Global News]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theatrum Artis Scribendi''''' is a book about [[calligraphy]] by [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first edition was published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1594; a second edition was published in 1614 by his son, Johannes Janssonius. A facsimile, limited to 300 copies, was published in 1969 by Midland Publishers of the Netherlands. The facsimile was printed by N. Miedma and Co. of Leeuwarden and bound by Van Rijmenam N.V. in The Hague.

Translated from [[Latin]], the title of the book is ''Theatre of the Art of Writing''. It is an anthology of handwriting specimens by Solomon Henrix, van den Velde, Felix Van Sambix, Curione, M. Martine, Beauchesne, Houthusius, P. Goos, Jacomina Hondius, Peter Bales and other scribes. The book opens with a four page typeset instruction in the art of writing, and is followed by a series of 42 copperplate engravings. Each engraving is a specimen of roman, italic, blackletter, or Hebrew letters, usually accompanied by ornamental swashes, surrounded by an ornate [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]]. Each plate, or series of plates, is signed by its creator.

The '''Wildenstein Institute''' is a French art institute that publishes [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] and scholarly inventories.  

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1970 by [[Daniel Wildenstein]] as the ''Fondation Wildenstein'', and it was renamed the Wildenstein Institute in 1990. It is an offshoot of the art dealing company ([[Wildenstein &amp; Co.]]) owned by the Wildenstein family for five generations.

It houses the historic documents and photographic archives assembled by Nathan Wildenstein (the company founder) and his son [[Georges Wildenstein|Georges]], which have been added to by subsequent generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/special_sites/wildenstein/printer.asp?page=3|title=The Wildenstein Institute|publisher=Christies|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Wildenstein established the [[Wildenstein Index Number]] used by the Institute to identify paintings.

It publishes catalogues raisonnés and scholarly inventories of impressionists such as Monet, and other modern artists such as Gauguin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-buying-art-dealer-wildenstein8217s-manhattan-headquarters-1391049030?tesla=y|title=Qatar Buying Art Dealer Wildenstein's Manhattan Headquarters|last=Maloney|first=Jennifer|date=29 January 2014|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes itself as a center for research in art history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=accueil&amp;lang=en Institute web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently headed by [[Guy Wildenstein]].

==Controversy==
The Institute publishes a Monet catalogue raisonné and is regarded as the "official" authenticator of Monet paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tom-flynn.blogspot.com/2011/07/exclusive-more-on-monet-rejected-by.html|title=More on the Monet rejected by the Wildenstein Institute|last=Flynn|first=Tom|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance of a Monet by the Institute significantly increases the commercial value of a painting. The Institute controversially refused to authenticate ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' after an investigation by [[Fiona Bruce]] (a journalist) and [[Philip Mould]] (an art dealer and historian) in the BBC television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', which first aired on 19 June 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF"&gt;{{Cite episode

In 2011, a police raid discovered and seized 30 paintings valued at tens of millions of pounds from the Institute's Paris headquarters (see: [[Guy Wildenstein#Criticism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8301627/Artworks-worth-millions-seized-from-Wildenstein-Institute.html|title=Artworks worth millions seized from Wildenstein Institute|last=Samuel|first=Henry|date=2 February 2011|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy’s Homogeneity Needs Rethinking - Hippo Reads|author=|date=|website=read.hipporeads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities." National Center For Education Statistics, E.D. Tabs, July 1997. U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; Women make up as little as 17% of philosophy faculty in some studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;U.S. Department of Education statistics in above-cited reports seem to put the number closer to 17%, but these numbers are based on data from the mid-1990s. [[Margaret Urban Walker]]'s more recent article (2005) discusses the data problem and describes more recent estimates as an "(optimistically projected) 25–30 percent."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|author=|date=|website=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science]. Newappsblog.com (2011-03-28).

Inside Higher Ed (2011-05-27). Retrieved on 2011-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and several blogs, including [[Gawker]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.gawker.com/5787195/philosophy-departments-are-full-of-sexual-harassment Philosophy Departments Are Full of Sexual Harassment]. Ca.gawker.com (2011-03-30). Retrieved on 2011-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jezebel]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna North, [http://jezebel.com/5787263/philosophy-profs-propose-shunning-sexual-harassers Philosophy Profs Propose "Shunning" Sexual Harassers], Jezebel, Mar 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, a series of posts on the blog "What's it like to be a woman in philosophy?" instigated a spate of mainstream media articles on the continued dominance of men in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"How can we end the male domination of philosophy?" https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/26/modern-philosophy-sexism-needs-more-women&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What Is Philosophy's Problem With Women?: http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/09/09/philosophy_has_a_woman_problem_let_s_try_to_figure_out_why.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the Humanities, Men Dominate the Fields of Philosophy and History": http://chronicle.com/article/Men-Dominate-Philosophy-and/135306/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Name Five Women In Philosophy. Bet You Can't.:https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/06/17/192523112/name-ten-women-in-philosophy-bet-you-can-t&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Schliesser, a professor of philosophy at [[Ghent University]], said he believes that the "...systematic pattern of exclusion of women in philosophy is, in part, due to the fact that my profession has allowed a culture of [[harassment]], sexual predating, and [[bullying]] to be reproduced from one generation to the next."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===
[[File:Angela Davis en Bogotá, Septiembre de 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Angela Davis]] (born 1944) is an American [[Activism|political activist]], philosopher and author. Her research interests include [[African-American studies]] and the philosophy of punishment and prisons.]]
There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy? Do the Math|first=Sally|last=Haslanger|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the "...representation of scholars of color is plausibly worse than in any other field in the academy, including not only physics, but also engineering."&lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;  According to professor L.K. McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

However, all chapters focus broadly on issues minorities face in the profession, philosophical issues regarding minorities, and work done by minority philosophers, as well as issues that are specific to that school’s philosophy department. MAP’s short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing "connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/uploads/2/2/3/2/22328318/eoy_report_.pdf|title=Minorities and Philosophy End of Year Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools.

===APA committee on the status of women in philosophy===

The Committee on the Status of Women is a committee of the [[American Philosophical Association]] devoted to the assessment and reporting on the status of women in philosophy.&lt;ref name="apaonlinecsw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/mission|title=Mission - APA Committee on the Status of Women|author=|date=|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently chaired by [[Hilde Lindemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/members|title=Committee Members - APA Committee on the Status of Women|author=|date=|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, the Committee on the Status of Women co-sponsored a session on the central question "Why Are Women Only 21% of Philosophy".&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lemmingsblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/apa-report-status-of-women-in.html|title=APA Report: the Status of Women in Philosophy|author=|date=|website=lemmingsblog.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this session, Sharon Crasnow suggested that the low numbers of women in philosophy may be due to:
* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

The blog [[Jennifer Saul#Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award|Feminist Philosophers]] hosts the Gendered Conference Campaign, which works toward increasing the representation of women at philosophy conferences and in edited volumes. The blog states that "all-male events and volumes help to perpetuate the stereotyping of philosophy as male.

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;
[[File:Emilie_Chatelet_portrait_by_Latour.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706-1749)]]
In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

===Ancient philosophy===

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.&lt;ref name="Wider1986"&gt;K. Wider, "Women philosophers in the Ancient Greek World", 21–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykoutris"&gt;I. Sykoutris, ''Symposium (Introduction and Comments)'', 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] attributes to the (possibly fictional) [[Diotima of Mantinea]] his lessons in the art of Eros (or philosophical searching). [[Plato]]'s final views on women are highly contested, but the ''Republic'' suggests that women are equally capable of education, intellectual vision, and rule of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside|first1=Christine|title=Plato on Women|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1975|pages=131–138|jstor=3177773|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jacobs, William "Platon on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=William|title=Plato on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family|journal=Apeiron|date=June 1978|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–31|doi=10.1515/apeiron.1978.12.1.29|jstor=40913404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie.

*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the [[University of Bologna]] in May 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Laura Bassi| work = MacTutor Biography| publisher = University of St Andrews| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bassi.html| accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,&lt;ref name="Findlen, Paula"&gt;Findlen, Paula.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyzyUpMfh24C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]]. ''The World Encyclopedia of Peace''. Edited by [[Ervin László]], [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Jong Youl Yoo]]. Oxford : Pergamon, 1986. {{ISBN|0-08-032685-4}}, (vol. 3, pp. 201–4).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

===Contemporary philosophy===
[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G. E. M. Anscombe (1919–2001)|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1019–1021|jstor=20131480}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate. She has written extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' has described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] of [[ethics|morality]], [[philosophy of education|education]] and [[philosophy of mind|mind]], and writer on [[existentialism]]. From 1984 to 1991, she was [[Master (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]]. Warnock studied at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]], entitled "Imagination and Understanding," at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1992. She has written extensively on [[ethics]], [[existentialism]] and [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name=Honderich&gt;{{cite book|last=Honderich|first=Ted|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866132-0|page=907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.
*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D.

'''European countries''' have had varying policies that confine '''women and military service''' or the extent of their participation in the national [[armed services]] of their respective countries, especially [[combatant]] roles in [[armed conflicts]] or hostile environments. While most of the countries have always allowed women to participate in military activities involving no direct aggression with the [[enemy]], most began seeing the value of servicewomen in the armed services during the [[First World War]] when they began losing unprecedented numbers of servicemen. In modern times many of the European countries now allow women to voluntarily pursue a [[career]] path or [[profession]] in the national armed services of their country as well as permit [[conscription]] equality, with minimal or no restrictions at all.

==Denmark==

Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962 the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non-commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974.

In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998 laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/denmark.htm NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009|7}} the highest rank reached by a woman in the Danish armed forces is Colonel (Susanne Bach Bager, Telegrafregimentet), with 5.2% (832) women in the services: 153 officers, 176 NCOs, and 503 privates (not counting women serving as "concripts").&lt;ref&gt;http://forsvaret.dk/FPT/Nyt%20og%20Presse/fakta/kvinderiforsvaret/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; From the summer 2007 to July 2009 a total of 84 women have served in the Danish Battalion in Helmand province, Afghanistan. This includes frontline service in infantry units and active participation in combat. However recent recruitment of women has been low in Denmark due to rising job opportunities elsewhere. NATO reports also indicate that the Danish military does not promote women to positions of leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

As with many nations with women in their armed forces, Denmark has different basic physical requirements for men and women in their armed forces, however the requirements for the more physically demanding jobs do not differ for either sex.

The [[Finnish Defense Forces]] does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the [[Finnish Border Guard|Border Guard]]. Females serve under the same conditions as men, with the exception that during the first 45 days of service they have the option to leave the military without consequences. After that, they must complete the service which lasts 6, 9 or 12 months. After the service, the females face the same reserve obligations as the males who have done the obligatory military service. If the female in national service experiences a conscientious crisis which prevents her from fulfilling her military service or reserve obligations, she is ordered to the alternative civilian service, which lasts 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950194 Law on the voluntary military service for women (194/1995)] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

All services and units in the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard accept females. In garrison environment, the females are lodged in separate rooms and are given separate toilet and bath facilities. In exercises and aboard ships, women are lodged with men. The women in national service are given an extra allowance of €0,40 per diem for sanitary articles and smallclothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naiset.dsp Finnish Defence Forces.

The women who have completed the voluntary military service are eligible for further military employment. If they have at least NCO training, they can apply for career NCO positions or for officer training. These career paths have been open since 1996, when the first women completed the military service. In 2005, 32 female career officers were in service. The number of female warrant officers was 16 and the number of female specialist officers 7. In comparison, there were a total of 2.584 officers and 894 specialist officers in service. The women made up about 16% of the total career NCO cadre. However, most of these career NCOs were grandfathered former female enlistees who had not undertaken military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/perustietoa/toiminnantuloksellisuus/pdf/htp05.pdf Finnish Defence Forces.

[[Image:Naispunakaartilainen.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Red Guard soldier from [[Finnish Civil War]]]]
The history of women in the Finnish military is, however, far longer than just since 1995. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] had several ''Naiskaarti'' (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War. The fighting women of the Reds were shunned in the [[White Guard (Finland)|White]] propaganda but in the Red side propaganda they were admired and also compared to the "[[amazons]] of old".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vanha.hum.utu.fi/historia/raunistula/yhteiskunta/naiskaarti/kaarti7.html Hakala, A.

In 1961, the Finnish Defence Forces started to enlist females for second-line duties. The duties available to women were radar operator, sea-control person, and C3 person. Most of the female enlisted served in coastal artillery and [[Finnish Air Force]]. The women enlisted all served in the rank of ''värvätty'' (enlisted), using a special female uniform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soal.fi/tietopankki/index.php?group=00000210&amp;mag_nr=5 Sotilasammattiliitto SoAL ry.

The non-combat duties in Finnish Defence Forces [[peace-keeping]] operations opened to women in 1991. At first, the women without previous military training experienced rather large problems in the Finnish peace-keeping units, most remarkably in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the mid-1990s. Since the introduction of the voluntary military service, the women have mostly the same training as the men which has lessened the problems. Only a handful of women without military training, mostly nurses or social service personnel, are serving with the Finnish peace-keeping forces. All duties in Finnish foreign operations are open to women, provided they have the necessary military training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat/45min_2003/arkisto.shtml?91386 Naisista tasa-arvoisia rauhanturvaajia.] MTV3 news service.

In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called [[Cantinières]]. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantinières had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Following the drums: Cantinieres|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_cantinieres.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Santé des Armées). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. Nonetheless, women are still not permitted to join the field combat units or to be aboard the submarines of the French navy.

[[Valérie André]], a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as Médecin Général Inspecteur. A veteran of the [[French Resistance]], she served overseas in [[Indochina]]. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. André is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She retired from active service in 1981. Many other French women were involved in the [[Women in the French Resistance|French Resistance]].

==Germany==

Since the creation of the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country. That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of [[World War II]]. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as [[Flakhelfer]]), served in [[Luftwaffe]] artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/H491/women-combat.htm D'Ann Campbell, "Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union" ''Journal of Military History'' (April 1993), 57:301-323 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the ''Sanitätsdienst'' ([[Medical corps]]) of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, [[Verena von Weymarn]] and Erika Franke, attained the rank of ''[[Generalarzt]]'' (Surgeon General). But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]]. The change in the law was prompted after a qualified female [[electronics technician]] argued her case to the European Court of Justice after her application to join the Maintenance-Recovery Service (Electronics) technical unit of the German Armed Forces was rejected in 1996, citing "it is barred by German law for women to perform armed services". The court ruled that preventing women from occupying combat roles in the armed forces was against sexual equality principles. 244 of the first 1,900 women who signed up following the law change were admitted on the first day of the new rules, the majority of them joining the army and air force.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1097492.stm Women join German fighting forces]&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are women serving in the ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' (paratrooper), aboard [[submarine]]s and jet-fighter aircraft. Before the law change 4,400 women only occupied [[military medicine]] or [[Military band|military-band]] roles within the German armed forces. The new legislations initially did not receive full military support. A report on the subject commented that, regarding the older male soldiers, "The way they see themselves as male fighters is shattered". Like many countries who have accepted women into combat roles, Germany conducts special courses on preventing sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

After several years of experience the commotion inside the Bundeswehr has now remarkably decreased. Today women are regularly being sent to foreign deployments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1842630,00.html Germany Marks Five Years of Women in Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 about 16,900 female soldiers serve in the Bundeswehr, representing a share of 9 percent of all troops except conscripted soldiers.

During [[World War II]], the [[Italian Social Republic]] established the Female Volunteer Unit ({{lang-it|Corpo volontario femmnile}}) as an auxiliary service and their soldiers were known as Female Auxiliary Unit ({{lang-it|Servizio Ausiliario Femminile}}). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/RSI_ANALISI/34.htm|title=Decreto istitutivo del Corpo femminile|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent in [[Southern Italy]] during World War II, was the ''CAF'', {{lang-it|Corpo di Assistenza Femminile}}, that was on the side of the [[Allies]]. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to [[sub-lieutenants]] and wore military uniforms made in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museobadoglio.altervista.org/docs/forze.pdf|title=Forze del Regno del Sud|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Female Police unit ({{lang-it|Corpo di Polizia femminile}}) was established.

In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted  into the [[Italian Naval Academy]] of [[Livorno]] ({{lang-it|Accademia navale di Livorno}}). She was born in 1962 in [[Trieste]] and started to try to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of the Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66, which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but Italy's State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When Diadora Bussani became famous and the case was well-known, the [[United States Navy]] symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informagiovani.it/frame/_donnemiliti.htm Informagiovani]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was the last country among [[NATO]] members to allow women to deploy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Rassegna+Arma/2004/Suppl_3/I+Sessione/01_Sessione_03.htm#3 L'impatto del servizio militare femminile.

==Norway==
Women in Norway have been serving in military roles since 1938. During the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join in 1959.

Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military. 
In 1995, Norway became the first country to allow women to serve on its military [[submarines]]

In a further step in favour of gender equality in the armed services, the Norwegian parliament voted, with a strong majority, the 14th of June 2014, a [[Bill (law)|bill]] to extend [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] to females from mid-2016. Norway is the first NATO member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both sexes.&lt;ref name="NMMSW"&gt;[http://rt.com/news/197152-norway-army-women-military-conscripts/ Girls in the army: Norway passes bill on mandatory military service for women]&lt;/ref&gt; It will apply to all medically fit Norwegian citizens between age 19-44 born from 1997 onwards.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt; Women born in 1997 and onwards will also be subject to conscription during wartime.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt;

As of 2017, 1341 of the 11596 military personnel in the Norwegian military forces were women (12%). Of all the conscriped soldiers the same year, the female percentage was 23%. c&lt;ref&gt;https://forsvaret.no/fakta_/ForsvaretDocuments/Forsvarets_aarsrapport_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2017, major general Tonje Skinnarland became the first-ever appointed woman to be the head of the Royal Norwegian air force.

==Poland==
Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the occupation by the [[Nazi]]s, 1939–1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the [[Home Army]]. The Germans were forced to establish special [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s after the [[Warsaw Rising]] in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm Women in Home Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of [[Maria Wittek]].

In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college [[nursing]] or [[veterinary]] degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 Women in army - in Polish]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
{{Main| Women in the Russian and Soviet military}}

The first woman known to have enlisted in the Russian Army was [[Nadezhda Durova]] who, pretending to be a man, fought with distinction in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. At that time, however, she was very much of a unique exception in an all-male army.

During the [[First World War]], heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] soldiers. To psychologically energize morale [[Alexander Kerensky]] (leader of Russia of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]) ordered the creation of the Woman’s Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wdeath.htm Women's Death Battalion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) till December 1991.

The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia’s military strength.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They're not allowed in combat roles, however.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Russian army runs the [[Miss Russian Army]] beauty contest for attractive female Russian soldiers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Colonel Gennady Dzyuba, of the Defense Ministry, said of the 2005 contest that "Those who have served, especially in hot spots, know the importance of women in the [[armed forces]]."{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Soviet Union: 1917–1991===

{{Main| Soviet women in the Great Patriotic War}}
Women had the legal right to serve in the [[Red Army|Soviet Armed Forces]] throughout the post Second World War period, with many all-female units existing as far back as World War One. By the early 1990s, 100,000 women made up 3% of the Soviet Armed Forces.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LyudmilaPavlichenko1.jpg|thumb|Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] --&gt;

During the Second World War, the Soviet Union had a female military strength of over one million women [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/jan-feb/obrien.html] who served as snipers, machine gunners, and tank crew members. Very few of these women, however, were ever promoted to officers.

In 1942 the [[Soviet Union]] formed three regiments of women combat pilots to fly night bombing missions over Germany, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, later called the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment. These women took part in regular harassment bombing against the Germans in [[Polikarpov Po-2]] biplanes, and participated in the final onslaught against Berlin. The regiments, collectively known to the Germans as the "Nachthexen" ("[[Night Witches]]"), flew more than 24,000 sorties and won in total 23 [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] medals. Some of the most talented women pilots were assigned day fighter duties. [[Lydia Litvyak|"Lily" Litvak]] and [[Katya Budanova]] became fighter aces flying the Soviet Union's best fighter designs alongside men in day attacks. Both were killed in their aircraft. Meanwhile, in the ground combat role [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], made 309 confirmed kills including 36 enemy snipers. Pavlichenko was one of the many female snipers of the Soviet Army.

In 1967, the Soviet Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available combat soldiers during periods of large-scale mobilisation. Thus, several programs during the height of the cold war were set up to encourage women to enlist. Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for ex-servicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples. Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves.

In the Soviet Union civil universities, in addition to professional education, gave basic military training to the youth of both sexes. Many secondary schools in [[post-Soviet countries]] still have defense lessons, both for boys and girls.

==Serbia==
 {{commonscat|Military women of Serbia}}
Although the Serbian combat forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was [[Milunka Savić]]. In the [[Second World War]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisan units]] accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army.

In Yugoslavia (including Serbia and other states), two million women were directly involved in non-combat support roles with Yugoslavia's partisans, and 100,000 served in the partisan army during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar, "Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview," ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' (1981) 14#2 pp 143-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as [[sutler]]s in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"&gt;Sjöberg, Maria: ''Kvinnor i fält 1550-1850.'' [Women in Combat] Gidlund (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named ''marketenterska''.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being [[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt;

In 1924, the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]] (Swedish: Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer, commonly known as Lottorna) was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the [[Swedish Home Guard]], a part of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id%3D11756 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045646/http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
[[File:Breguet 19 Sabiha.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female pilot to fly during a conflict, 1937]]
When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. [[Nene Hatun]], whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.&lt;ref name="nato.int"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator. She was one of the eight adoptive children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "20 Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air Force in 1996.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/gokcen.html Sabiha Gokcen (1913-2001), Pioneer Aviatrix&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. The women officers serve together with the men under the same respective chains of command. The personnel policy regarding women in the Turkish Armed Forces is based on the principle of "needing qualified women officers in suitable branches and ranks" to keep pace with technological advancements in the 21st century. Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armour, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.&lt;ref name="nato.int"/&gt;

As of the year 2005, the number of the female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces is 1245.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2005/win/national_reports/turkey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

Women may now join the British Armed forces in all roles except those whose "primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy": [[British Army Infantry|Infantry]], [[Household Cavalry]], [[Royal Armoured Corps]], [[Royal Marines|Royal Marines Commandos]], [[RAF Regiment]], [[Special Air Service]] and [[Special Boat Service]]. In addition medical reasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} used to preclude service in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service]] or as Mine Clearance Divers, but in May 2014 it was announced that three women had become the RN's first female submariners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Navy gets first female submariners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27278588|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are however, permitted access to special force's support units, such as commando engineers and are cleared to join the [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]], a largely unknown branch of the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] that does not bar women from joining.

Female personnel currently make up around 9% of the British armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm Defence Factsheet, Women in the Armed Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929073139/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm |date=2012-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, female combatants can be found throughout Britain’s military history.&lt;ref&gt;BBC news [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6502847.stm article] on Women in Combat, retrieved on March 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example is Queen [[Boudica]], who led warriors of the Iceni tribe against Roman forces occupying Britain around AD 62, her legacy being often quoted in support of arguments calling for the full opening up of the British Armed forces to women.

In the medieval period, Queens and noblewomen such as [[Ethelfleda]] of Mercia, [[Matilda of England]], [[Isabella of France]] and [[Margaret of Anjou]] commanded armies in battle, although they did not fight themselves. Many women including Queen [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] accompanied their husbands on Crusade. In the 16th century [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], accompanied troops in several campaigns. Women continued to lead armies or organise the defense of castles in the absence of their male relatives until the close of the [[English Civil War]]. Charles I's consort, [[Henrietta Maria of France]] was the last English queen to command troops in battle in northern England in 1643.

During the 1776 American War of Independence, it is estimated that over 5,000 women accompanied British forces. Many of these would have been the wives of high-ranking officers, with a large proportion being the wives of serving soldiers. While as much as possible women were left in the camp, they sometimes accompanied forces in their baggage trains serving as cooks or nurses, and were occasionally caught in combat and killed or taken prisoner. Similarly women accompanied men in ships of the [[Royal Navy]], in combat being employed as powder monkeys or assisting [[surgeon]]s.

During [[World War I]] the British Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps was formed; Lieutenant-General H Lawson recommended using it in France in 1917. Sir Neville Macready, the Adjutant-General, supported the idea that women and men should be treated the same at the front. Women served in the British Army during World War One as cooks, medical staff and clerical staff, however women were not permitted to be officers, and there were many disputes over pay. In 1917 the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) was formed, although then disbanded in 1919 It provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel.

Prior to [[World War II]], in 1938 the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during the conflict as well as serving as military police. Some women took part in direct combat roles as part of mixed gender teams manning heavy anti-aircraft batteries and gun crews within Britain. Women members of the teams might sight and aim anti-aircraft guns and even give the command to fire, but the actual release of the trigger was always (officially at least) reserved for a male soldier. A number of women operated on active service in wartime Europe with special services, engaged in intelligence, sabotage and laison with local resistance groups. During the war, the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was incorporated into the ATS. The WRNS was reformed at the outbreak of war in 1939, with an increased range of shore-based opportunities available.

In 1949 women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still available only to men. In this year, the Women's Royal Army Corps was created to replace the WAAC, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army.

The 1991 Gulf War marked the first deployment of British women in combat operations since 1945. Women were engaged in a broad range of support operations up to 8&amp;nbsp;km from the front line. In 1992 British Army units devoted only to women were disbanded, and women were distributed amongst the same units in which men served. During the 1990s an increasing number of roles were opened up to women including direct combat support roles in intelligence, artillery, engineering and signals.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Woodward, Trish Winter, ''Sexing the soldier: the politics of gender and the contemporary British Army,'' Routledge, (2007) pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 seagoing opportunities were opened to WRNS personnel leading to the full integration of the WRNS with the Royal Navy in 1993. To date several female personnel have commanded small ships of the RN and a recently retired Commanding Officer of [[HMNB Clyde|HM Naval Base, Clyde]], Commodore Carolyn Stait, is a former WRNS Officer.

The [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel|seizure]] of [[Royal Navy]] sailor [[Faye Turney]] in 2007 by the [[Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|naval forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] led to some media comment on the role of women and mothers in the armed forces.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2411286.ece |title= Only the capture of Prince Harry could have done more damage |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[commander-in-chief]] of the British Armed Forces is a woman ([[Queen Elizabeth II]]) though her position is only nominal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3431">The '''Zutistes''' or the '''Circle of Poets Zutiques''' was an informal group of French poets, painters and musicians who met at the Hôtel des Étrangers, at the corner of rue Racine and rue de l'École-de -Medicine, in Paris from September to October 1871.

==Background==

The Zutistes were a fringe spin-off from a splinter group of [[Parnassianism|Parnassians]], known as the "Nasty Fellows" or "Villains Bonshommes",&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; who formed a Parisian dining club at the close of the 1860s. Without having a formal manifesto, and taking their name from the French exclamation of baffled exasperation, ''Zut'',&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129n&lt;/ref&gt; this informal gathering of artists known as the Zutistes gathered around the figure of the pianist [[Ernest Cabaner]], who worked as a bartender/piano player at the hotel.  Anarchic in spirit, they looked back regretfully to the atmosphere of the recently overthrown [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant figure in the circle was [[Charles Cros]], while other members were later better known, like [[Verlaine]] and [[Rimbaud]].

The most significant trace of the movement came with the re-discovery in the Thirties of the Zutique Album, with some 101 literary entries accompanied by (sometimes pornographic) drawings.&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Album==

Shot through with black humour, and riddled with parody and pastiche of contemporary styles and attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; the album is the best guide to the Circle's membership of some fourteen names.

A central target of the Album's mockery was the recently successful Parnassian [[Francois Coppee]], while other more established figures like [[José-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leconte de Lisle]] were also in the line of fire.&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

This album is in the form of an in-quarto Italian, black hardback cover, about thirty sheets handwritten, the other pages remained blank.

==Aftermath==
Nostalgia for the circle persisted among its members long after its break-up, perhaps as early as the winter of 1871–1872: thus for example the young Zutiste [[Raoul Ponchon]] was one of only seven recipients of Rimbaud's ''[[A Season in Hell]]'';&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Cros in 1883 used "zutique" to name  a new poetry circle; while (perhaps coincidentally) as late as in 1897 the claim would be made that "man is by nature essentially 'zutique'".&lt;ref&gt;Anon, quoted in S Whidden, ''Authority in Crisis in French Literature'' (2016) p 64&lt;/ref&gt;
