The '''''Arabic Bayán''''' is a book written by the [[Báb]] around 1848. Its larger sister book is the ''[[Persian Bayán]]''. The work is incomplete, containing only eleven [[Vahid]]s. Each Vahid serves as a chapter and contains nineteen [[Abwab]]. The grammar is highly irregular.{{Elaboration needed|date=December 2016}} The work was composed while the Báb was imprisoned in [[Maku, Iran]].

'''Bilocation''', or sometimes '''multilocation''', is an alleged [[psychic ability|psychic]] or [[miracles|miraculous]] ability wherein an individual or object is located (or appears to be located) in two distinct places at the same time.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]].

The concept has been used in a wide range of historical and philosophical systems, ranging from early [[Greek philosophy]] to modern religious stories, [[occultism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].

==In religion and mysticism==
[[File:Sant'Alfonso Liguori.jpg|thumb|right|Several religious figures have historically claimed to have bilocated. In 1774, [[St. Alphonsus Liguori]] claimed to have gone into a trance while preparing for Mass. When he came out of the trance he said that he had visited the bedside of the dying [[Pope Clement XIV]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}]]

Several [[Christian]] [[saint]]s, [[monk]]s and [[Muslim]] [[sufi]]s are said to have exhibited bilocation.  Among the earliest is the apparition of [[Our Lady of the Pillar]] in the year 40. St [[Isidore the Farmer]] claimed to be praying or attending to Mass in Church while at the same time plowing in the fields.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Other Christian figures said to have experienced bilocation include St. [[Alphonsus Marie De'Liguori]] (Founder of Redemptorist Congregation), [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony of Padua]], [[Ursula Micaela Morata]], [[Gerard Majella|St. Gerard Majella]], [[Charles of Mount Argus]], [[Pio of Pietrelcina|Padre Pio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Day| first= Malcolm| title= Blood brother: Padre Pio| url= http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/228/blood_brother_padre_pio.html| journal= Fortean Times| date= September 2002| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090203170134/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/228/blood_brother_padre_pio.html| archivedate= 2009-02-03| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Severus of Ravenna|St. Severus of Ravenna]], [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose of Milan]], [[María de Ágreda]],&lt;ref&gt;This holy virgin burned with a most ardent love for God and for the salvation of souls. One day, she beheld in a vision all the nations of the world. She saw the greater part of men were deprived of God's grace, and running headlong to everlasting perdition. She saw how the Indians of Mexico put fewer obstacles to the grace of conversion than any other nation who were out of the Catholic Church, and how God, on this account, was ready to show mercy to them. Hence she redoubled her prayers and penances to obtain for them the grace of conversion. God heard her prayers. He commanded her to teach the Catholic religion to those Mexican Indians. From that time, she appeared, by way of '''bilocation''', to the savages, not less than five hundred times, instructing them in all the truths of our holy religion, and performing miracles in confirmation of these truths. When all were converted to the faith, she told them that religious priests would be sent by God to receive them into the Church by baptism. As she had told, so it happened. God, in his mercy, sent to these good Indians several Franciscan fathers, who were greatly astonished when they found those savages fully instructed in the Catholic doctrine. When they asked the Indians who had instructed them, they were told that a holy virgin appeared among them many times, and taught them the Catholic religion and confirmed it by miracles. (Life of the Venerable Mary of Jesus of Agreda, § xii.) Thus those good Indians were brought miraculously to the knowledge of the true religion in the Catholic Church,'' because they followed their conscience in observing the natural law''. Muller, Michael. [http://www.traditionalcatholic.net/Tradition/Information/The_Catholic_Dogma/Contents.html The Catholic Dogma: "Extra Ecclesiam Nullus omnino Salvatur"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin de Porres|St. Martin de Porres]], and [[María de León Bello y Delgado]].

In the [[Coptic Church]], Saints [[Yostos El Antony]] and [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] were claimed to bilocate in the [[20th century]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Witchcraft==
In the 17th century, persons accused of witchcraft were reported to appear in dreams and visions of witnesses. The trials at [[Bury St. Edmunds witch trials|Bury St. Edmunds]] and [[Salem witch trials|Salem]] included this "[[spectral evidence]]" against defendants. [[Matthew Hopkins]] described the phenomenon in his book ''The Discovery of Witches''.

==Modern==
The English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] was reported by acquaintances to have the ability, even though he said he was not conscious of its happening at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Martin (2000) "A Magick Life: Biography of Aleister Crowley", Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-340-71805-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilocation figures heavily in [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) and  [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Against the Day]]'' (2006). Bilocation also plays a part in the Christopher Priest novel ''The Prestige''.

A mystical story that involved Soviet author [[Yevgeny Petrov (writer)|Yevgeny Petrov]] served as inspiration for the film ''[[Envelope (film)|Envelope]]'' (2012) starring [[Kevin Spacey]].

==Skepticism==

Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that there is no scientific evidence that bilocation is a real phenomenon and that cases are often from anecdotal reports that cannot be verified. Nickell listed self-[[delusion]], [[hoax]]ing and [[illusion]] to explain alleged cases of bilocation.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">The '''Buber-Rosenzweig-Medaille''' is an annual prize awarded since 1968 by the [[Deutscher Koordinierungsrat der Gesellschaften für Christlich-Jüdische Zusammenarbeit]]
(DKR; German Coordinating Council of Societies for Christian-Jewish Cooperation) to individuals, initiatives, or institutions, which have actively contributed to [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation|Christian–Jewish understanding]]. Forty-four different societies belong to the DKR. The name of the prize honors the memory of the [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian-Jewish]] philosopher, translator, and educator [[Martin Buber]] (1878–1965) and the [[History of the Jews in Germany|German-Jewish]] theologian [[Franz Rosenzweig]] (1886–1929). In its inaugural year, the prize was granted to both the historian [[Friedrich Heer]] (''Gottes erste Liebe''; ''God's First Love'') and the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] theologian [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Marquardt]] (''Die Entdeckung des Judentums für die christliche Theologie: Israel im Denken Karl Barths''; ''The Discovery of Judaism for Christian Theology: Israel in the Thought of Karl Barths'').

The '''Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam''' ('''CDHRI''') is a declaration of the member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] adopted in [[Cairo]], Egypt, on 5 August 1990,&lt;ref name = Brems&gt;{{cite book | last = Brems | first = E | isbn = 90-411-1618-4 | title = Human rights: universality and diversity: Volume 66 of International studies in human rights | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 2001 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=INlkqsHpIFEC&amp;pg=PA241 241–84] | chapter = Islamic Declarations of Human Rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Conference of [[Foreign Minister]]s, 9–14 [[Muharram]] 1411H in the [[Islamic calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html University of Minnesota, Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;) which provides an overview on the Islamic perspective on [[human rights]], and affirms [[Islamic]] [[sharia]] as its sole source. CDHRI declares its purpose to be "general guidance for Member States [of the OIC] in the field of human rights".

This declaration is widely acknowledged as an Islamic response to the [[United Nations]]'s [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted in 1948. It guarantees many of the same rights as the UDHR and serves as a living document of human rights guidelines prescribed for all members of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) to follow, but restricts them explicitly to the limits set by the [[sharia]]. This greatly restricts rights with respect to the Universal Declaration, since for example, women and members of other religions do not have the same rights as men under sharia, and that [[freedom of expression]] can be severely limited for religious reasons: for example, [[blasphemy]] can even now be punishable by death, in clear opposition to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

==History==
Various [[Muslim countries]] had criticized the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights for its failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;National Review Online, [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs-david-g-littman Human Rights and Human Wrongs], David G. Littman, January 19, 2003, retrieved 30 May, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Said Rajaie-Khorassani—the post-[[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] Iranian representative to the UN—articulated the position of his country regarding the UDHR, by saying that it was a [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] "[[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Midstream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs/david-g-littman|title=Universal Human Rights and 'Human Rights in Islam'|publisher='Midstream'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHRI was adopted in 1990 by members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. It has been signed by 45 states so far.&lt;ref&gt;Anver M. Emon, Mark Ellis, Benjamin Glahn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3hpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 Islamic Law and International Human Rights Law] p. 113. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the CDHRI was presented to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], where it was strongly condemned by the [[International Commission of Jurists]].

==Contents==
The Declaration starts {{Citation needed|reason=A cursory glance at the source reveals that the document does not start with this sentence, but in fact begins by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam."|date=June 2017}} by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam." and it forbids "discrimination on the basis of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Skin colour|colour]], [[language]], [[belief]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[political affiliation]], [[social status]] or other considerations". It goes on to proclaim the [[sanctity of life]], and declares the "preservation of human life" to be "a duty prescribed by the [[Shariah]]". The CDHRI also guarantees non-belligerents—such as old men, [[women and children]], the wounded and sick, and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]—the [[right to food]], shelter, and access to safety and medical treatment in times of war.

The CDHRI affords women "equal human dignity", "own rights to enjoy", "duties to perform", "own civil entity", "financial independence", and the "right to retain her name and lineage". Both men and women are given the "right to marriage" regardless of their race, colour, or nationality. The Declaration makes it incumbent upon both parents to protect the child, both before and after birth, while stressing that the [[Gender roles in Islam|husband is responsible]] for the social and financial protection of his family, including any children and wives. 

The Declaration recognises the [[Right to property|rights to property]] and [[right to privacy|privacy]] for the individuals.&lt;ref name="RuleGreenleaf2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rule|first1=James B.|last2=Greenleaf|first2=G. W.|title=Global Privacy Protection: The First Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2I2Lrf1BeYC&amp;pg=PA45|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84844-512-3|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baderin2003"/&gt; The Article 18 (b) says that "Everyone shall have the right to privacy in the conduct of his private affairs, in his home, among his family, with regard to his property and his relationships. It is not permitted to spy on him, to place him under surveillance or to besmirch his good name. The State shall protect him from arbitrary interference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html |title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forbids the [[demolition]] and [[confiscation]] of any family's residence and the [[eviction]] of the family.&lt;ref name="Baderin2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baderin|first=Mashood A.|title=International Human Rights and Islamic Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHRCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP141|date=11 September 2003|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102182-4|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, should the family get separated in times of [[Islam and war|war]], it is the responsibility of the [[Sovereign state|state]] to "arrange visits or reunions of families".

Article 10 of the Declaration states: "Islam is the religion of unspoiled nature. It is [[Haram|prohibited]] to exercise any form of [[Al-Baqara 256|compulsion]] on man or to exploit his [[Islam and poverty|poverty]] or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to [[Atheism and Islam|atheism]]." Since in Islamic society all reasons for conversion away from Islam are considered to be essentially{{by whom|date=February 2018}} either compulsion or ignorance, this effectively forbids conversion away from Islam.

The Declaration protects each individual from [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[torture]], maltreatment, or indignity. Furthermore, no individual is to be used for medical or scientific experiments without his consent or at the risk of his health or of his life. It also prohibits the taking of hostages of any individual "for any purpose whatsoever". Moreover, the CDHRI guarantees the [[presumption of innocence]]; guilt is only to be proven through a trial in "which he [the defendant] shall be given all the guarantees of defence". The Declaration also forbids the promulgation of "emergency laws that would provide executive authority for such actions". Article 19 stipulates that there are no other crimes or punishments than [[Hudud#Punishments|those mentioned in the sharia]]. Sharia allows [[corporal punishment]] (whipping, amputation) and [[capital punishment]] by [[Stoning#In Islam|stoning]] or [[Beheading in Islam|decapitation]].&lt;ref&gt;There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Schari’a.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to hold public office can only be exercised in accordance with the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2003), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration also emphasizes the "full right to freedom and self-determination", and its opposition to [[Slavery in Islam|enslavement]], oppression, [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and [[Muslim conquests|colonialism]]. The CDHRI declares the [[rule of law]], establishing "equality and justice for all", [[Fiqh|with the limitations provided under Islamic law]]. The CDHRI also guarantees all individuals the "right to participate, directly or indirectly in the administration of his country's public affairs". The CDHRI also forbids any abuse of authority "subject to the Islamic Shariah."

Article 22(a) of the Declaration states that "Everyone shall have the right to [[Freedom of speech|express his opinion freely]] in such manner as would not be [[Sharia#Freedom of speech|contrary to the principles of the Shariah]]." Article 22(b) states that "Everyone shall have the right to advocate what is right, and propagate what is good, and warn against what is wrong and evil according to the norms of Islamic Shariah." Article 22(c) states: "Information is a vital necessity to society. It may not be exploited or misused in such a way as may violate sanctities and the dignity of Prophets, undermine moral and ethical values or disintegrate, corrupt or harm society, or weaken its faith." This is an explicit restriction on the freedom to make any statement which might be considered blasphemous, the penalty for the making of which might be death and as such the wording of this clause allows the death penalty for blasphemy in clear contravention of the UDHR.     Article 22(d) states that "It is not permitted to arouse nationalistic or doctrinal hatred or to do anything that may be an incitement to any form of racial discrimination."

===Religious features===
{{further information|Human rights in the Quran}}
Although the CDHRI uses a [[Universalism|universalist]] language akin to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "quite a number of [its] features express an Islamic particularity."&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt; The [[preamble]] is mostly religious [[rhetoric]], and the particulars of the CDHRI contain numerous references to the [[Quran]], sharia, and aspects of the Islamic faith that appear on no other similar international list.&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt; The CDHRI concludes in Articles 24 and 25 that all rights and freedoms mentioned are subject to the Islamic sharia, which is the declaration's sole source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, Aug. 5, 1990, U.N. GAOR], World Conf. on Hum. Rts., 4th Sess., Agenda Item 5, U.N. Doc.
A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.18 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The CDHRI declares true religion to be the "guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human [[integrity]]". It also places the responsibility for defending those rights upon the entire [[Ummah]].

==Criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of Sharia law|Human rights in Islamic countries|Application of sharia law by country|Islam and violence}}

The CDHRI has been criticized for being implemented by a set of states with widely disparate religious policies and practices who had "a shared interest in disarming international criticism of their domestic human rights record."&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt;

Article 24 of the declaration states: "All the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Sharia." Article 19 also says: "There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Sharia."&lt;ref name="Farouh2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kazemi | first = F | chapter = Perspectives on Islam and Civil Society | title = Islamic Political Ethics: Civil Society, Pluralism and Conflict | editors = Hashmi SH | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-691-11310-6 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=5LmXFpnp_bMC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 50] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHRI has been criticised for failing to guarantee [[freedom of religion]], in particular the right of each and every individual to [[Apostasy in Islam|change their religion]], as a "fundamental and non-derogable right".&lt;ref name="Farouh2002"/&gt; In a joint written statement submitted by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), a [[non-governmental organization]] in special [[consultative status]], the Association for World Education (AWE) and the Association of World Citizens (AWC), a number of concerns were raised that the CDHRI limits human rights, religious freedom, and freedom of expression. The statement concludes that "The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam is clearly an attempt to limit the rights enshrined in the UDHR and the International Covenants. It can in no sense be seen as complementary to the Universal Declaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|title=The Cairo Declaration and the Universality of Human Rights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031135736/http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|archivedate=2008-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, in an article to the United Nations, the [[Center for Inquiry]] writes that the CDHRI "undermines equality of persons and freedom of expression and religion by imposing restrictions on nearly every human right based on Islamic Sharia law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/cfi_defends_freedom_of_expression_at_the_un_human_rights_council/|title=CFI Defends Freedom of Expression at the U.N. Human Rights Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhona Smith writes that, because of the CDHRI's reference to Shariah, it implies an inherent degree of superiority of men.&lt;ref name="Smith2003"&gt;Rhona, Smith. ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84174-301-1}}, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adama Dieng]]—a member of the [[International Commission of Jurists]]—has also criticised the CDHRI. He argued that the declaration gravely threatens the inter-cultural consensus on which the international human rights instruments are based; that it introduces intolerable discrimination against non-Muslims and women. He further argued that the CDHRI reveals a deliberately restrictive character in regard to certain fundamental rights and freedoms, to the point that certain essential provisions are below the legal standards in effect in a number of Muslim countries; it uses the cover of the "Islamic sharia (Law)" to justify the legitimacy of practices, such as corporal punishment, which attack the integrity and dignity of the human being.&lt;ref name="Midstream"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2009, the journal ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: "We are deeply concerned with the changes to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by a coalition of Islamic states within the [[United Nations]] that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Bangdalesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters—in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kurtz, [[Austin Dacey]], and Tom Flynn. "Defaming Human Rights". ''[[Free Inquiry]]''. February/March 2009, Vol. 29, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Candomblé Jejé''', also known as '''Brazilian Vodum''', is one of the major branches (''nations'') of [[Candomblé]]. It developed in the [[Portuguese Empire]] among [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]] slaves. Jejé is a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word meaning ''stranger'', which is what the Fon and Ewe slaves represented to the Yoruba slaves.

==Vodums==

Jejé spirits are called ''Vodums'' (sing. ''Vodum'').  According to tradition, they were introduced into the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] from nearby lands by its founder [[Adja-Tado of Dahomey|King Adja-Tado]], on the advice of a ''bokono'' (seer). Their cult was reorganized and uniformized by [[Agajah of Dahomey|King Agajah]] in the 18th century.

Jejé Vodums are sometimes cultuated in houses of other nations by different names. For instance, the Vodum Dan or Bessen is called Oxumarê in [[Candomblé Ketu]]. Conversely, the Ketu Orixás may be cultuated in Jejé houses, but retain their names.

Voduns are organized into families:

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"

| Dan || Yewá || Fá

The '''Church of Cognizance''' ('''COC''') was founded in 1991 by Danuel &amp; Mary Quaintance&lt;ref&gt;[http://danmary.org dan&amp;mary's Monastery-HEMPorium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530103628/http://danmary.org/ |date=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Graham County (Pima) [[Arizona]], [[United States]].

==Beginnings==
In 1994, the Quaintances recorded a 16-page "Declaration of Religious Sentiment" concretizing the establishment of their church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/coc-recording.pdf ''Coc-declaration'']&lt;/ref&gt; The COC Founders recording announced their intent to unite the world's ethnic minorities that utilize and rely upon the [[cannabis]] hemp plant as an ethno-socio-religious institution following Neo-Zoroastrian tenets.

While COC members are encouraged to study all of the world's religions, the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]] is held by them to be the least convoluted and most ancient source supporting their practices and beliefs. Numerous references to [[Haoma]] may be found in the Avesta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/y9to11s.PDF ''Translated Avesta Yasna 9-11'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the COC with 40 to 50 members in Arizona, nationwide had 72 registered Individual Orthodox Member Monasteries (IOMMs), which are located inside members' homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070216222414/http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/137087.php ''(Archived) Arizona Daily Star - Pot church takes a hit '']&lt;/ref&gt;

==COC Membership==
To become a "registered member" of the COC, a candidate must read a pamphlet titled "The Church Of Cognizance Introduced".&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/pledge.pdf ''The Church Of Cognizance Introduced'']&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet includes the below stated beliefs, description of organization, and the membership pledge of the church. If the candidate is in agreement with the beliefs, organization, and pledge, they then must then fill out, and sign their PLEDGE and return it to the designated address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iomm.info ''(Official) COC Membership page''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605230913/http://iomm.info/ |date=2013-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Members of the COC claim to believe:

1. That [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as [[Haoma]], when raised and used properly, aids the mind, body, and soul.

2. That Haoma is the ancient teacher of wisdom, compassion, and the way to the kingdom of glory in heaven on earth, while humans let ego block their own, and others, path to this kingdom of glory.

3. That Haoma is the capable provider of all substance required to accommodate a comfortable, healthy, productive, full-bearing life.

4. That Haoma is the righteous Protector of their health, and longevity; by way of receptors in the human body that believe Haoma connects with to heal.

Based on their beliefs, they declare Marijuana/Cannabis/Haoma to be "the teacher, the protector, the provider". And further, that the proper religious use promotes "Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds, none of which is harmful to the health, safety, welfare, or morals of society in general".

===Organization===
The COC is composed of "Family Oriented Monastic Orders" wherein members are dedicated to promoting the health, safety, welfare, culture, and tradition of the family thru their belief:

1. That the physically able, retired adults, of the family should care for the sick, the eldest, and the youngest of the family.

:      a. The eldest of the family whom have provided in the past should not be forgotten and tossed aside for strangers to care for.

:      b. The children of the family need to learn the family’s culture and traditions from a member of the family with that wisdom.

:      c. It allows the able bodied of the family to work and provide for the entire family without the worry of who's caring for their offspring, and whose customs and traditions they are taught.

:      d. It keeps family together, helping family, and the family as a whole may become Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise.

Each Family Oriented Monastic Order of the Church Of Cognizance is designated an "Individual Orthodox Member Monastery" (IOMM).

===Members Pledge===
By submitting their application, prospective members pledge their allegiance, and support, to the Church Of Cognizance and the IOMMs of which it is composed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/coc_pledge.pdf ''Members Pledge'']&lt;/ref&gt; Their pledge requires:

:       a. That they will do their best to live an honorable life; in a family oriented mode; as described in The Church Of Cognizance Belief’s Introduced.

:       b. That they will not allow any Marijuana raised for religious use to enter into commerce, nor will they provide marijuana to anyone outside of the Church Of Cognizance; other than in providing for the religious use by a potential member; and, that use must be under their direct supervision.

:       c. They agree that until such time as the governments end their war against the sacrament of the COC, they will keep any cultivation, or use, confined to a secluded, secure area, in order to mitigate government fears regarding child endangerment.

:       d. They understand that it is a duty of theirs to share the bounty of any harvest with the sick, and dying free of charge; when requested, if they are aware, or made aware, of it being beneficial in such situations.

:       e. And last, that they will respect other family’s lifestyles by agreeing not to introduce any minors into the Marijuana Religion.

On February 22, 2006, the founders of the Church of Cognizance, Danuel and Mary Quaintance, were arrested with 172 pounds of marijuana. They asserted that the marijuana was for religious use, an argument which US District court judge Judith C. Herrera rejected outright. The federal judge stated that the evidence shows the two created the church and beliefs as a way of justifying their lifestyle choice to use marijuana and their belief that marijuana should be legalized.  She further stated they cannot avoid prosecution for illegal conduct by simply calling their conduct a religion.  Also it was noted that the monasteries were all located in members' homes.  The church states a "declaration of religious sentiment" on behalf of the Church of Cognizance was filed with the Graham County Recorder's Office 12 years prior this arrest in 1994. Further noted was that the Quaintances had not faced any prior criminal charges related to their church and that they do not grow marijuana but pick it up from church "couriers", which is what they were doing when they were arrested.  Both founders stepped down as leaders of the church following their arrests. But the couple hope to one day resume what they view as their worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azstarnet.com/lifestyles/faith-and-values/court-overrules-church-s-use-of-pot-as-sacrament/article_55458b9c-880d-5aaf-a4cf-5c424612aa3e.html ''Arizona Daily Star - Court overrules church's use of pot as sacrament '']&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2008, they both pleaded guilty to two counts. One count of conspiracy with intent to distribute 200 pounds or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana; and one count of possession with the intent to distribute 100 pounds or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana, as well as aiding and abetting.  They faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Danuel Quaintance is serving{{When|date=November 2017}} a five-year sentence at a facility at the Federal Correctional Institute in Terminal Island, California, near Long Beach. Mary Quaintance is serving two years at the Victorville Federal Correctional Complex in Adelanto, Calif.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpho.com/news/20943492/detail.html "Pot Church Copes With Jailed Leaders"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614055400/http://www.kpho.com/news/20943492/detail.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they both were confident that an appeal based on their claimed religious use would keep them out of prison,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/faith/256138 "Arizona Daily Star - Pot-deifying duo guilty, confident they'll avoid prison"]&lt;/ref&gt; a unanimous three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 19, 2010, affirmed the denial of the couple’s RFRA defense in ''United States v. Quaintance''. The panel agreed that evidence in the case established that the Quaintances had failed to establish that their beliefs about marijuana as a sacred substance were sincerely held, further concluding that “the record contains … overwhelming evidence that the Quaintances were running a commercial marijuana business with a religious front — particularly in this transaction aimed at securing bail money for Ms. Quaintance’s brother.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100713031740/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=22979 ''Church founders can't escape drug charges  '']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">'''Clinical pastoral education''' (CPE) is [[education]] to teach [[pastoral care]] to [[clergy]] and others. CPE is the primary method of training hospital and hospice [[chaplains]] and spiritual care providers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt; Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; CPE is both a [[multicultural]] and [[interfaith]] experience that uses real-life ministry encounters of students to improve the ministry and pastoral care provided by caregivers.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm |title =Frequently Asked Questions about ACPE Clinical Pastoral Education |work =The Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, Inc |at = See section [http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm#faq1 What is Clinical Pastoral Education?] |accessdate = 2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theory==
An underpinning theory of education that structures clinical pastoral education is the "[[Reflective Practice|Action-Reflection]]" mode of learning. CPE students typically compose "verbatims" of their pastoral care encounters in which they are invited to reflect upon what occurred and draw insight from these reflections that can be implemented in future pastoral care events.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the practice of pastoral care has a long tradition in Christianity and to some extent in other faith traditions, the systematic analysis of pastoral practice associated with clinical pastoral education had its beginnings in the early 20th century. In 1925, [[Richard Clarke Cabot|Richard Cabot]], a physician and adjunct lecturer at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], published an article in ''[[Survey Graphic]]'' suggesting that every candidate for ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stokoe |first=Rodney J.R. |year=2005 |origyear=1974 |title=Clinical Pastoral Education |type=Reprint |journal=The Nova Scotia Medical Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=26–28 |issn=0029-5094 |url=http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-20 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171141/http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }} The reprint is available as part of the project: {{cite web |url=http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |title=Living Human Memories |work=CASC/ACSS The Canadian Association for Spiritual Care |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622230836/http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the Rev. [[Anton Boisen]] placed theological students at the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] in supervised contact with patients in mental hospitals, a flagship program that later resulted in the forming of the ACPE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403034355/http://www.aapc.org/content/brief-history-pastoral-counseling American Association of Pastoral Counselors/History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accrediting bodies==

CPE in Australia and New Zealand is conducted by six CPE accrediting associations that consult together for common curricula and standards of practice under an umbrella association, the Australia New Zealand Association of Clinical Pastoral Education (ANZACPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspea.org.au/anzacpe.php&lt;/ref&gt; The six constituent associations are: [[New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education]] (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory); Queensland Institute of Clinical Pastoral Education; Association for Supervised Pastoral Education in Australia (Victoria and Tasmania); Association for Clinical Pastoral Education in Western Australia; South Australia and Northern Territory Association for Clinical Pastoral Education; and New Zealand Association for Clinical Pastoral Education.

In the United States, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education is recognized as an [[education accreditation|accrediting]] organization for CPE programs by the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html|title =Specialized Accrediting Agencies| publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate = 2013-07-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, all CPE training and accreditation is done through [http://www.spiritualcare.ca/ CASC], the Canadian Association of Spiritual Care / Association Canadienne de Soins Spirituels.

'''Divine command theory''' (also known as '''theological voluntarism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/ Theological Voluntarism]&amp;nbsp;— [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[medieval theological voluntarism]] and [[theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory which proposes that an action's status as [[Morality|morally]] [[good]] is equivalent to whether it is commanded by [[God]]. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that for a person to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.

Numerous variants of the theory have been presented: historically, figures including [[Saint Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] have presented various versions of divine command theory; more recently, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] has proposed a "modified divine command theory" based on the [[omnibenevolence]] of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong. [[Paul Copan]] has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint, and [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski]]'s divine motivation theory proposes that God's motivations, rather than commands, are the source of morality.

Semantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostics]] could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on [[Modal logic|modal]] grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], first proposed by [[Plato]] (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral [[autonomy]] and [[religious pluralism]], although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.

==General form==
Various forms of divine command theory have been presented by philosophers including [[William of Ockham]], [[St Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[John Calvin]]. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of [[God]] and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the only reason that a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin 1993, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of their being commanded by God, and many [[religious belief|religious believers]] subscribe to some form of divine command theory.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson, Holmgren 2010, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/ | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine command theory features in the ethics of many modern religions, including [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and [[Christianity]], as well as being a part of numerous older [[polytheism|polytheistic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Rae 2009, ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Athens]], it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 2011, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

===Augustine===
[[Saint Augustine]] offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good, which delivers human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment.&lt;ref name=IEP-2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H2 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=15 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine supported [[Plato|Plato's]] view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting [[autonomy#Philosophy|autonomously]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Keller, Leever &amp; White 2009, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Duns Scotus===
[[File:JohnDunsScotus.jpg|thumb|John Duns Scotus, who proposed a variant of divine command theory]]
[[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher [[John Duns Scotus]] argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Swinburne, Richard | year=2007 | pages=358–359 | isbn=978-0-19-921246-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus argued that the [[natural law]], in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently [[logical truth|analytically true]] and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the [[Ten Commandments]]. The last seven of the [[Ten Commandments]] do not belong to the natural law in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst our duties to God are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without. Hence, the last seven commandments do belong to the natural law, but not in the strictest sense, as they belong to the natural law by rectitude rather than by definition.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

Whilst Aquinas, as a natural law theorist, is generally seen as holding that morality is not willed by God,&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#NatLaw&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly James Clark and Anne Poortenga have presented a defence of divine command theory based on [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas']] moral theory. Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence, and so human nature can determine what is moral. Clark and Poortenga argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
The [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures, among whom is ethicist [[R. M. Hare]]. Kant's view that morality should be determined by the [[categorical imperative]]&amp;nbsp;– duty to the moral law, rather than acting for a specific end&amp;nbsp;– has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory. Philosopher and theologian [[John E. Hare]] has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant's [[heteronomy|heteronomous will]]&amp;nbsp;– motives besides the moral law, which Kant regarded as non-moral.&lt;ref name=PT263&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher [[Lewis White Beck]] takes Kant's argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends of divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Hare challenges this view, arguing that [[Kantian ethics]] should be seen as compatible with divine command theory.&lt;ref name=PT263/&gt;

===Robert Adams===
[[File:RobertMerrihewAdams20060625.jpg|thumb|Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory"]]
American philosopher [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory".&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent:
#It is wrong to do X.
#It is contrary to God's commands to do X.&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008/&gt;
He proposes that God's commands precurse moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths, not the other way around. Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically 'wrong' consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a [[Judeo-Christian]] context. In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it, he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake. Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty, rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature. Adams emphasises the importance of [[faith]] in God, specifically faith in God's goodness, as well as his existence.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams proposes that an action is morally wrong [[if and only if]] it defies the commands of a loving God. If cruelty was commanded, he would not be loving; Adams argued that, in this instance, God's commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2003, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his [[omnibenevolence]]. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"/&gt;

Adams proposes that in many Judeo-Christian contexts, the term 'wrong' is used to mean being contrary to God's commands. In ethical contexts, he believes that 'wrong' [[logical consequence|entails]] an [[emotivism|emotional]] attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 561-2&lt;/ref&gt; Adams suggests that a believer's concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right. If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong, the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him; rather their concept of morality would break down.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God's omnipotence. Thomas Aquinas argued that God's omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible: he attempted to refute the idea that God's inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence. Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical, so is not covered by Aquinas' defence, although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7a | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
[[Paul Copan]] argues from a Christian viewpoint that man, made in God's image, conforms to God's sense of morality. The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God; a person's sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God's.&lt;ref name=Copan&gt;Copan, Paul, and William Lane Craig. ''Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics.'' Nashville, Tennessee: B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2007. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|We would not know goodness without God's endowing us with a moral constitution. We have rights, dignity, freedom, and responsibility because God has designed us this way. In this, we reflect God's moral goodness as His image-bearers.|Paul Copan|Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics&lt;ref name="Copan" /&gt;}}

As an alternative to divine command theory, Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory, which still fits into a monotheistic framework. According to this theory, goodness is determined by God's motives, rather than by what he commands. Divine motivation theory is similar to [[virtue ethics]] because it considers the character of an agent, and whether they are in accordance with God's, as the standard for moral value.&lt;ref&gt;Baggett &amp; Walls 2011, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties, such as being lovable, which are given to them through God's perception of them. God's attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-238093747.html | title=Zagzebski, Linda Trinkaus. Divine Motivation Theory.(Book review) | publisher=The Review of Metaphysics | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=25 August 2012 | author=Toner, Christopher |via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory casts God as a good example for morality, and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite, imperfect beings.&lt;ref&gt;Langermann 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==

===Semantic objections===
Philosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds, arguing that "being commanded by God" and "being obligatory" do not mean the same thing, contrary to what the theory suggests. He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to propose that "being commanded by God" does not have an identical meaning to "being obligatory". This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on [[modal logic|modal]] ideas of what might exist in different worlds. He suggested that, even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same, they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral motivation===
Michael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations. He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued, rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward. This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate.&lt;ref name=IEP-2 /&gt;

===Euthyphro dilemma===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato presents the Euthyphro dilemma in one of his dialogues.]]
{{Main|Euthyphro dilemma}}
The [[Euthyphro dilemma]] was proposed in [[Plato|Plato's]] dialogue between [[Socrates]] and [[Euthyphro]]. In the scene, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma, which can be presented as the question 'Is X good because God commands it, or does God command X because it is good?'&lt;ref name=IEPPlato&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H3 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action, or that God commands an action because it is good. If the first is chosen, it would imply that whatever God commands must be good: even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering, then inflicting suffering must be moral. If the latter is chosen, then morality is no longer dependent on God, defeating the divine command theory. Additionally, if God is subject to an external law, he is not sovereign or [[omnipotent]], which would challenge the orthodox conception of God. Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws.&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;

[[William of Ockham]] responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by '[[bite the bullet|biting the bullet]]'. He argued that, if God did command people to be cruel, then that would be morally obligatory, proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the [[principle of non-contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Moral Dilemmas in Medieval Thought: From Gratian to Aquinas | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Dougherty, M. V. | year=2011 | pages=163–164 | isbn=978-1-107-00707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] defended Ockham's view, noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what we consider to be immoral, not an actuality. Even if God could logically command these actions, he would not because that is not his character.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH4 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonore Stump and [[Norman Kretzmann]] have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of [[divine simplicity]], a concept associated with Aquinas and [[Aristotle]] which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical. They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=God, Goodness and Philosophy | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Harris, Harriet | year=2011 | pages=101 | isbn=978-1-4094-2852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American philosopher [[William Alston]] responded to the [[Euthyphro dilemma]] by considering what it means for God to be morally good. If divine command theory is accepted, it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God's goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations. He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God, so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands. Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character, which is necessarily good. There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Omnibenevolence===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and some more recent philosophers, challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God's goodness consists of his following his own commands. It is argued that, if divine command theory is accepted, God's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent. Neither could God hold any virtues, as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands&amp;nbsp;– if he cannot logically command himself, then he cannot logically have any virtues. Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good, but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy. William Wainwright argues that, although God does not act because of his commands, it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions. He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and, when he commands what is morally good, it becomes morally obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7b | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomy===
Michael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy, which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by. This challenges the view of divine command theory that God's will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous, but followers of an imposed moral law, making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory. Robert Adams challenges this criticism, arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God's commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7c | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Austin considers the view that, in a world of [[religious pluralism]], it is impossible to know which god's or religion's commands should be followed, especially because some religions contradict others, leaving it impossible to accept all of them. Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded. Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant, as an agent must choose whichever [[religion and morality]] they judge to be correct. He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that [[Ethics in religion|moral truths can be found in all religions]] and that moral revelation can be found [[Morality without religion|apart from religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7d | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heimir Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other (monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity, for example, and some Greek or Norse gods magnified human weaknesses). They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that, even within a religion, contrasting views of God exist&amp;nbsp;– the commands of God in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s could seem to contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson &amp; Holmgren 2010, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divine inspiration''' is the concept of a [[supernatural]] force, typically a [[deity]], causing a person or people to experience a [[Creativity|creative]] desire. It has been a commonly reported aspect of many [[religion]]s, for thousands of years. Divine inspiration is often closely tied to the concept of [[revelation]], the belief in information being revealed or disclosed through communication with a deity or other [[Non-physical entity|supernatural entity]] or entities.

==Examples==
Besides ancient mythology, the [[religious text]]s of traditions including [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Mormonism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are all claimed to be divinely inspired to some degree.
* Ancient [[Mesopotamia]]: In the Mesopotamian epic ''[[Atra-Hasis]]'', the writer describes his work as dictated by the Goddess in a dream-vision.
* Ancient Greece: The [[Muse|ancient Greek muses]] were said to be supernatural forces that gave artists their skill, while the [[Oracle|Ancient Greek oracles]] were said to be subject to supernatural forces. 
* Hinduism: [[Music]] has historically been considered a medium through which performers can become a vehicle for divine inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Bruce M. |last=Sullivan|title =Historical Dictionary of Hinduism|date =1997|page= 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cvhGP8NRx4QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Scarecrow Press|isbn = 9780810833272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess [[Saraswati]] is also sometimes invoked for assistance with inspiration.&lt;ref name=ar272&gt;{{Google books|IChFAAAAcAAJ|Asiatic Researches}}, - History and Antiquities, the Arts, Sciences and Literature of Asia, Volume 3, London, pages 272-273&lt;/ref&gt;
* Judaism and Christianity: Both religions claim [[Biblical inspiration]] for the parts of the [[Bible]] to which they adhere.
* Islam: Muslims believe the [[Quran]] was verbally revealed by God to [[Muhammad]] through the angel [[Gabriel]] (''Jibril''),&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Gray|title=The Leaders Are Coming!|date=2013|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=9781449760137|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sV0mAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22Muslims+believe+that+the+Quran+was+verbally+revealed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e8lCVMimDZS2yASeuYHgDg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Muslims%20believe%20that%20the%20Quran%20was%20verbally%20revealed%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams &amp; Drew"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy H.

==Counterexample==

The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have at times disclaimed divine inspiration with respect to their doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Do We Need Help to Understand the Bible? | journal= The Watchtower | date = February 15, 1981 | page = 19 | quote = "True, the brothers preparing these publications are not infallible. Their writings are not inspired as are those of Paul and the other Bible writers. (2 Tim. 3:16) And so, at times, it has been necessary, as understanding became clearer, to correct views. (Prov. 4:18)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; although at other times they propose that "divine guidance" is provided to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Do You See the Evidence of God's Guidance?", ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 2011, pages 3–5, "How, then, do we react when we receive divine direction? Do we try to apply it “right afterward”? Or do we continue doing things just as we have been accustomed to doing them? Are we familiar with up-to-date directions, such as those regarding conducting home Bible studies, preaching to foreign speaking people, regularly sharing in family worship, cooperating with Hospital Liaison Committees, and conducting ourselves properly at conventions? ... Do you clearly discern the evidence of divine guidance? Jehovah uses his organization to guide us, his people, through “the wilderness” during these last days of Satan’s wicked world."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plato's Manias==
[[Plato]] distinguishes four kinds of inspiration or "mania" in the dialogue [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]. The word "mania" signifying that a person is caught up in a state transcending the individual consciousness. In other dialogues, Plato identifies other manias besides the four given in Phaedrus. Anger, for example, is a mania because a man may become inspired by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] in battle and perform deeds of superhuman strength. The four given in Phaedrus, however, are called Divine as they are the inspirations which perfect the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Shrine of Wisdom, "Plato and the Four Inspirations", in 3 parts, Vol 29 &amp; 30 (1926), Vol 31 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Poetic or Musicial, inspired by [[The Muses]], brings the disordered parts of the soul into harmony.
# Telestic, inspired by [[Dionysus]], purifies the soul and returns it to its ideal state of perfection and wholeness.
# Prophetic, inspired by [[Apollo]], concentrates the soul to a unity.
# Amatory, inspired by [[Eros]], conjoins the unified soul to the gods and to intelligible Beauty, effecting divine union.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19136">'''Exclusivism''' is the practice of being [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusive]]; [[mentality]] characterized by the disregard for opinions and ideas other than one's own, or the practice of organizing entities into groups by excluding those entities which possess certain traits. (for an opposite example, see [[essentialism]]).

==Religious exclusivism==
{{Main|Chosen people|One true faith}}
Religious exclusivism, one of the three classic typologies created by [[Alan Race]] in order to describe religions relative to one another, states that one religion, to the exclusion of all others, has the correct understanding of God, truth and salvation. [[Diana L. Eck|Diana Eck]] states, ‘Exclusivism is more than simply a conviction about the transformative power of the particular vision one has; it is a conviction about its finality and its absolute priority over competing views’.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Douglas. "Exclusivism and Exclusivity: A Contemporary Theological Challenge." ''Pacifica'' 20.3 (2007): 296.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was originally used to define Christianity, exclusivism can apply to any religious belief system, as can Race’s other two categories [[inclusivism]] and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]]. In his 1982 ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Christians-Religious-Pluralism-Christian-Religions/dp/0334019389/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521581557&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=alan+Race+religious+pluralism Christians and Religious Pluralism],'' Race defined pluralism as all religions being equally beneficial, with no single religion dominating. Inclusivism attempts to straddle the poles of pluralism and exclusivism by agreeing with the latter that one religion (Christianity) has the most value, and agreeing with the former by stating that other religions still have significant value.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggy, Dale. "Religious Diversity, Theories Of." ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While Race’s three categories have been criticized, amended and refuted, most religious studies and interfaith scholars and students find the typologies useful as a starting point for conversations about the diversity of religions.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 223-24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic Three-point typology ==

=== Pluralism ===
Pluralism was borne out of a criticism of exclusivism, saying that no single tradition has a monopoly on revelation or salvation, and that we have no way to judge between the salvific claims by adherents of any faith tradition.  [https://www.rsis.edu.sg/profile/paul-hedges/#.WrF9WMPFLDc Paul Hedges] suggests that each religion knows ‘transcendent reality (“God”) yet in partial perspective,’ much like the oft-quoted parable of the seven blind men and the elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Paul. “A Reflection on Typologies: Negotiating a Fast-Moving Discussion.” ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008): 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gavin D'Costa|Gavin D’costa]]  says pluralists have two main critiques of exclusivists: people of other religions are god and loving and that they do not know their own Scriptures well enough.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 227.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]] says that pluralist’s problem with exclusivism stems from its immorality and arrogance. He quotes William Cantwell Smith: ‘Except at the cost of insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible actually to go out into the world and say to devout, intelligent, fellow human beings: “…we believe that we know God and we are right; you believe that you know God, and you are totally wrong.”’&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alan. “Pluralism: A Defense of Religious Exclusivism.” ''The Rationality of Belief and the Plurality of Faith'', Thomas D. Senor (ed). (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1995): 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Smith, the leading proponent of pluralism is John Hick, who writes:

[Exclusivism], with its baleful historical influence, in validating centuries of anti-semitism, the colonial exploitation by Christian Europe of what today we call the third world, and the subordination of women within a strongly patriarchal religious system, not only causes misgivings among many Christians but also alarms many of our non-Christian neighbors, creating invisible but powerful barriers within the human community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pluralism and Particularity in Religious Belief|last=Stetson|first=Brad|publisher=Praeger|year=1994|isbn=|location=Westport CT and London|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that D’costa argued persuasively that logically, pluralism can no longer be considered a category; when it makes a declarative truth claim, it becomes another form of exclusivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Costa|first=Gavin|date=1996|title=The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions 32.2 (1996): 223-32|url=|journal=Religious Studies|volume=32:2|pages=225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusivism ===
Inclusivists state that while one religion or revelation is true (Christianity), other truths can be found in fragments within other religions.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states it succinctly: ‘Insofar as they in good conscience practice what is good in their religion, people in other religions receive God’s grace and are “anonymous Christians,” people who are being saved through Christ, though they do not realize it.’ &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuggy|first=Dale|date=2015|title=Religious Diversity, Theories Of|url=|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusivists point to the biblical parable of the sheep and the goats in which the saved sheep show surprise at being rewarded for their service to [[Jesus]] (Matthew 25: 31-40)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2010|title=Religious Exclusivism|url=|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity|volume=|pages=86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusivism in Christianity and other religions ===
According to Race, the history of the Abrahamic faiths’ exclusivism – as well as inclusivism – goes back to the words of the Bible and the Qur’an.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Race, Alan. “Theologies of Religions in Change: Factors in the Shape of a Debate.” ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian exclusivists point to John’s gospel (14: 6), which quotes Jesus as saying, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ After Jesus’ death, his disciple Peter said publicly, ‘Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved’ (Acts 4:12). Likewise, the Qur’an (3:85) states, ‘If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).’ While Judaism does not stress salvation, the First Commandment (Exodus 20:3) is ‘You shall have no other gods before me.’ Race says, ‘The tension between Christian experience and the recognition of potential authentic practice outside of the Christian revelation, in fact has always existed in Christian history from the beginning, from the words of Jesus himself in the gospel of Luke: in 9:50 he says, “He who is ''not against'' us is for us”’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Daniel Strange points out what Race neglects to mention: that in the same gospel (11:23), Jesus says, ‘He who is ''not with me'' is against me.’&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Daniel. “Exclusivisms: ‘Indeed Their Rock is Not like Our Rock.’ ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008) 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== No salvation outside the Church ==
The exclusivist idea of ‘no salvation outside of the Christian church’ (''[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|Extra ecclesiam nulla salus]]'') has roots as early as [[Origen]] in the third century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And while the Bible speaks about many topics of inclusion, diversity and tolerance in both the Old and New Testament – attitudes toward the alien and stranger; the hope of Christians being drawn from all nations and languages; God’s universal care and sustaining of creation; the universal scope of the gospel and the universal mandate to take the gospel to the nations&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; – the overwhelming feeling in the Church throughout most of its history mimics that of the [[Council of Florence]] in 1422: ‘The Council firmly believes, professes and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but Jews, heretics and schismatics, cannot participate in eternal life, but will depart into everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his [sic] angels.’&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] continued the exclusivist theological bent: ‘For where Christ is not preached, there is no Holy Spirit to create, call and gather the Christian Church, and outside it no one can come to the Lord Christ’.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 41&lt;/ref&gt; The door in the exclusivist castle opened a crack during the 20th century missionary movement, when Dutch missiologist [[Hendrik Kraemer]] wrote that Jesus is the one who has the complete authority to judge other religions’ efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Highlighting a unique contemporary take on the salvation problem, Strange introduces [[George Lindbeck]]’s contention that those who do not know the Bible cannot be condemned for their lack of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New wave of exclusivism ==
Mara Brecht states that the problem with classic exclusivism is that it deals mainly with Christianity and salvation (or ‘top down’). She highlights the work of the ‘New Wave of exclusivism,’ led by Griffiths, D’costa and Netland, who employ a ‘bottom up’ approach to religious diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Mara. "What's the use of Exclusivism?" ''Theological Studies'' 73.1 (2012): 34.&lt;/ref&gt; New Wave Exclusivists focus more on the religious believers’ ‘ways of knowing and understanding of religious beliefs as expressive truth,’ resulting in a broader possibility for interfaith engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Netland sets aside comparing religions’ salvation when he says dialogue should focus on the most important question all religions deal with – the question of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht reaches the conclusion that exclusivism is tenable for Christians – and by extension other religious believers – if believers come into contact with believers of other religions who can possibly ‘defeat’ their own, so they can have something to base their truth claims on. Brecht says, ‘Practically, this means that, for example, reflective Christians will consider their beliefs to be as ''probable'' as alternatives from within their own tradition, ''somewhat more probable than'' the relevant alternatives from within Judaism and ''considerably more probable than'' Buddhist alternatives. In other words, believers will weigh their beliefs against other beliefs.’&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions of exclusivism ==
Douglas Pratt further defines exclusivism, dividing it into three subdivisions – open, closed and extreme. Citing t’Hooft and Kraemer, Pratt says open exclusivism, while never ceding the superior position, ‘may at least be amenably disposed toward the other,’ if only in order to know Them well enough for possible conversion. The relationship is not entered into on equal ground, therefore, nor with the openness to a significant reciprocal change of self-identity. If dialogue is entered into, it is only for mutual edification and an increase in good will.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Douglas. "Exclusivism and Exclusivity: A Contemporary Theological Challenge." ''Pacifica'' 20.3 (2007): 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Closed exclusivism offers no chance for a relationship, other than acknowledging the other’s right to exist.  An extreme, hard-line exclusivism often leads to a fundamentalist perspective. Pratt writes, ‘Fundamentalism, as a mindset, is a mentality that expresses the modern quest for universality and coherence writ large: only one truth; one authority; one authentic narrative that accounts for all; one right way to be.’&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The logical conclusion for this fundamentalist mindset is taking steps to eliminate the other, as one would a business competitor. Pratt writes, ‘The negation of otherness is perhaps critical, for it involves a devaluing and dismissal of the "other," whether in terms of rival community or competing alterities, ideological or otherwise. In the process of negating the other, the self is asserted as inherently superior. My God is greater than your god.’&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 298-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Moser]] posits two forms of exclusivism: logical religious exclusivism, which asserts that since the contradictory, foundational truth claims for each religion excludes some or many of them from being true;&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Paul K. "Religious Exclusivism." ''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity'' (2010): 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the doxastic redemptive exclusivism based on the Athanasian Creed, which states if a person does not believe the Christian concept of the Trinity, that person is condemned. Moser further believes that a God who would exclude people from salvation for neither hearing nor understanding the concept of the Trinity does not have a moral character, and is therefore undeserving of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exclusivism in other religions ==
While most attention of exclusivism points toward Christianity, each religion has a branch that falls into the exclusivist category. D’costa&lt;ref&gt;D'cost, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; points out whether one considers oneself Buddhist or Hindu or Muslim – or indeed a pluralist – each version states that ‘only one single revelation or one single religion is true and all other “revelations” or religions are false.’ While acknowledging that historically, Christianity showed the most extreme forms of exclusivism, Pratt contends that many fundamentalist religions compete for that title, with Islam leading other worthy contenders&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; in ways that are not always obvious. With the purging of the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] in [[Myanmar]], the Buddhist Rakhine have joined the ranks of fundamentalists willing to resort to killing to achieve dominance over competing religions.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Morgan. “Love Thy Neighbor: South Asia Christians Advocate for Rohingya Muslims.” ''Christianity Today'', Oct. 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Ancient Greece==
The Decree of Diopithes (430 BCE) forbade the worship of and belief in gods other than those of the Olympian pantheon recognised by the Athenian polis. The introduction of other gods was treated as ''asebeia'', or [[impiety]], and was punishable by death. The philosophers [[Anaxagoras]], [[Protagoras]], [[Socrates]], [[Stilpo]], [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Theophrastus]] were accused of impiety under this decree. Socrates was found guilty of the charge of introducing new gods and condemned to death by drinking [[conium|hemlock]].

[[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], [[Selucid]] ruler of Israel, decided to Hellenize the Jews by ordering the worship of Zeus; when they refused, Antiochus sent an army to enforce his decree.

According to [[Herodotus]] the Caunians, a Greek people who claimed to have originated in Crete and settled in Asia Minor, worshiped the Olympian Gods exclusively. "They determined that they would no longer make use of the foreign temples which had been established among them, but would worship their own old ancestral Gods alone. Then their whole youth took arms, and striking the air with their spears, marched to the Calyndic frontier, declaring that they were driving out the foreign Gods."

[[Plato]], in his Laws, advocates that the state should punish those who deny the existence of the Olympian Gods or believe that the gods exist but think they are indifferent to mankind or can be easily bought by bribes.

''[[Interpretatio graeca]]'', the common tendency of ancient Greek writers to identify foreign divinities with members of their own pantheon, can be seen as a kind of exclusivism. The [[syncretism]] of the [[Hellenistic]] period whereby aspects of the cults of foreign Gods such as iconography and epithets, can also be seen as a kind of exclusivism.

=== Exclusivism and religious diversity in America ===
In a sociological survey of Americans and their relationship with religions other than Christianity, nearly 90 percent of respondents either strongly or somewhat agreed that “religious diversity has been good for America,” which reinforces the idea that Americans value diversity and religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, Stephen. "Religious Diversity in a "Christian Nation": The Effects of Theological Exclusivity and Interreligious Contact on the Acceptance of Religious Diversity." ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 49.2 (2010): 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, respondents who identified in the exclusivist category or believed that the United States was a Christian nation displayed much more negative views and a decreased willingness to include other religious people in the lives of their community.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Merino concludes, ‘It may be that when many Americans think of “religious diversity,” they have only Christian diversity in mind.’ &lt;ref&gt;Merino, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, they also provided research to back up their statement, ''‘''Prior contact with non-Christians will be associated with more positive views of religious diversity and increased willingness to include non-Christians into social life.’ &lt;ref&gt;Merino, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusivism and truth ===
In answering the pluralist charge, and hearkening back to Netland, Brad Stetson baldly states, ‘It is possible exclusivism is true.’ &lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this statement, he says, that upsets pluralists who charge exclusivists with arrogance and bad form. ‘It is simply not true, as pluralists imply, that disagreeing with someone […] about religious truth is tantamount to treating them badly.[…] [a]n exclusivist claim about religious truth is not defeated strictly because such claims are believed to militate against human harmony and peace.' &lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hick, Smith and other pluralists balk at the idea that an all-loving God would condemn some people to hell,&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; nor that anyone actually deserves to be damned;&lt;ref name="Stetson, 123"&gt;Stetson, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; he then quotes CS Lewis: ‘The doors of hell are locked on the ''inside.’'' &lt;ref name="Stetson, 123"/&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''faith'' is thought to date from 1200–1250, from the Middle English ''feith'', via Anglo-French ''fed'', Old French ''feid'', ''feit'' from Latin ''fidem'', accusative of ''fidēs'' (trust), akin to ''fīdere'' (to trust).&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith |title=Faith – Define Faith |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of faith development ==
{{Main|James W. Fowler#Stages of Faith}}

[[James W. Fowler]] (1940–2015) proposes a series of stages of faith-development (or [[spiritual development]]) across the human life-span. His stages relate closely to the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], Erikson, and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] regarding aspects of psychological development in children and adults. Fowler defines faith as an activity of trusting, committing, and relating to the world based on a set of assumptions of how one is related to others and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Nancy|last1=Evans |first2=Deanna |last2=Forney |first3=Florence |last3=Guido |first4=Lori |last4=Patton |first5=Kristen |last5=Renn |title=Student Development in College: Theory, Research, and Practice |edition=Second |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=|year=2010 |isbn=978-0787978099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages of faith ===
# Intuitive-Projective: a stage of confusion and of high impressionability through stories and [[ritual]]s (pre-school period).
# Mythic-Literal: a stage where provided information is accepted in order to conform with [[social norm]]s (school-going period).
# Synthetic-Conventional: in this stage the faith acquired is concreted in the [[belief system]] with the forgoing of personification and replacement with [[authority]] in individuals or groups that represent one's beliefs (early-late adolescence).
# Individuative-Reflective: in this stage the individual critically analyzes adopted and accepted faith with existing systems of faith. Disillusion or strengthening of faith happens in this stage. Based on needs, experiences and paradoxes (early adulthood).
# Conjunctive faith: in this stage people realize the limits of [[logic]] and, facing the paradoxes or [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] of [[personal life|life]], accept the "mystery of life" and often return to the sacred stories and symbols of the pre-acquired or re-adopted faith system. This stage is called negotiated settling in life (mid-life).
# Universalizing faith: this is the "enlightenment" stage where the individual comes out of all the existing systems of faith and lives life with universal principles of compassion and love and in service to others for upliftment, without worries and [[doubt]] (middle-late adulthood (45–65 years old and plus).&lt;ref&gt;Works of [[Daniel Levinson|Daniel J. Levinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=May 2018}}

No hard-and-fast rule requires individuals pursuing faith to go through all six stages. There is a high probability for individuals to be content and fixed in a particular stage for a lifetime; stages from 2-5 are such stages. Stage 6 is the summit of faith development. This state is often{{quantify|date=December 2015}} considered as "not fully" attainable.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, J.W.; Stages of Faith – The Psychology of Human Development and the Quest for Meaning&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahá'í Faith ===
{{See also|Role of faith in the Baha'i Faith}}
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds,&lt;ref&gt;Baha'i World Faith – Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately the acceptance of the divine authority of the [[Manifestations of God]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |page=155|isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the religion's view, faith and knowledge are both required for spiritual growth.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Faith involves more than outward obedience to this authority, but also must be based on a deep personal understanding of religious teachings.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Faith in Buddhism}}
Faith in Buddhism (''{{lang-pi|saddhā}}'', ''{{lang-sa|śraddhā}}'') refers to a serene commitment in the practice of the Buddha's teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] or ''[[bodhisattvas]]'' (those aiming to become a Buddha).&lt;ref name="Gomez 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gómez|first1=Luis O.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Faith|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|pages=277–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=388–9}} Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one particular object of faith, such as one particular Buddha.&lt;ref name="Gomez 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinnard|first1=Jacob N.|author-link=Jacob N.

In [[early Buddhism]], faith was focused on the [[Triple Gem]], that is, [[Gautama Buddha]], his teaching (the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]]), and the community of spiritually developed followers, or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the [[Sangha]]). Although offerings to the monastic community were valued highest, early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]].{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=74–5, 81}} A faithful devotee was called [[upasaka and Upasika|''upāsaka'' or ''upāsika'']], for which no formal declaration was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tremblay|first1=Xavier|editor1-last=Heirman|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Bumbacher|editor2-first=Stephan Peter|encyclopedia=The spread of Buddhism|title=The spread of Buddhism in Serindia|date=2007|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004158306|edition=online|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Buddhism, personal verification was valued highest in attaining the truth, and sacred scriptures, reason or faith in a teacher were considered less valuable sources of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Paul|title=The notion of diṭṭhi in Theravāda Buddhism : the point of view|date=2004|publisher=[[RoutledgeCurzon]]|location=London|isbn=0-203-01043-4|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31392862/The_notion_of_Ditthi.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1507847029&amp;Signature=ZGrJoGZcaUjL%2FEaIJ55xwsailIU%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_notion_of_Ditthi.pdf|page=36}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As important as faith was, it was a mere initial step to the path to [[Paññā|wisdom]] and [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], and was obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path.{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=384, 396–7}}

While [[faith in Buddhism]] does not imply "blind faith", Buddhist practice nevertheless requires a degree of trust, primarily in the spiritual attainment of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Faith in [[Buddhism]] centers on the understanding that the Buddha is an Awakened being, on his superior role as teacher, in the truth of his [[Dharma]] (spiritual teachings), and in his [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (community of spiritually developed followers). Faith in Buddhism can be summarised as faith in the [[Three Jewels]]: the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or [[bodhi]], and [[Nirvana]].

Thus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, [[Buddhist modernism]] in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism.

{{Main|Faith in Christianity}}
The word translated as "faith" in the New Testament is the Greek word ''πίστις'' (''pístis'') which can also be translated "belief", "faithfulness", and "trust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/4102.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 4102. πίστις (pistis) -- faith, faithfulness|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various views in Christianity regarding the nature of faith. Some see faith as being persuaded or convinced that something is true.&lt;ref name= Wilkin2012&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Ten Most Misunderstood Words in the Bible |year=2012 |author=Wilkin, Robert N. |page=221 |publisher=GES |location=Corinth, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, a person believes something when they are presented with adequate evidence that it is true. Theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] did not hold that faith is mere opinion: on the contrary, he held that it is a mean (understood in the Platonic sense) between excessive reliance on science (i.e. demonstration) and excessive reliance on opinion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Then there are numerous views regarding the results of faith. Some believe that true faith results in good works, while others believe that while faith in [[Jesus]] brings eternal life, it does not necessarily result in good works.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://redeeminggod.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Faith-and-Good-Works-JD-Myers.pdf (PDF) Jeremy Myers, The Gospel Under Siege: 3 Views on the Relationship Between Faith and Good Works]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of which approach to faith a Christian takes, all agree that the Christian faith is aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. The Christian sees the mystery of [[God]] and his [[Divine grace|grace]] and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, faith is not static but causes one to learn more of God and to grow; Christian faith has its origin in God.&lt;ref name= Wuerl2004&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=a#PPA237,M1 |title=The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults, Edition: 5, revised |year=2004 |author=Wuerl, By Donald W. |page=238 |isbn=1-59276-094-5 |accessdate=21 April 2009|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Pub. Division |location=Huntingdon, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of faith given by the apostle Paul at Hebrews 11:1 carries particular weight with Christians that respect the Bible as the source of divine truth. There the apostle writes:

"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." — King James Version

"Now faith is the assurance that what we hope for will come about and the certainty that what we cannot see exists." — International Standard Version

“The naive or inexperienced person[is easily misled and believes every word he hears, but the prudent man is discreet and astute.” (Proverbs 14:15, Amplified Bible) The Christian apostle Paul wrote: “Test everything that is said to be sure it is true, and if it is, then accept it.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21, Living Bible)

In Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not only [[fideism]] or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements.&lt;ref&gt;Migliore, Daniel L. 2004. ''Faith seeking understanding: an introduction to Christian theology''. Grand Rapids, Mich: W.B. Eerdmans. pp. 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Christians have faith, they must understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith, and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions and on the personal experiences of the [[belief|believer]].&lt;ref&gt;Inbody, Tyron. 2005. The faith of the Christian church: an introduction to theology. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt; In English translations of the New Testament, the word "faith" generally corresponds to the Greek noun πίστις (''pistis'') or to the Greek verb πιστεύω (''pisteuo''), meaning "to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure".&lt;ref name=Thomas1981&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Robert L. |last2=Editor |first2=General |year = 1981 |title= New American standard exhaustive concordance of the Bible: |pages= 1674–75 |isbn= 0-87981-197-8 |publisher= A.J. Holman |location= Nashville, Tenn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christian apologetic views ====
In contrast to noted atheist [[Richard Dawkins]]' view of faith as "blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene. 2nd edn. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alister McGrath]] quotes the Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas (1861–1924), who states that faith is "not blind, but intelligent" and that it "commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...", which McGrath sees as "a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|title= The Order of Things: Explorations in Scientific Theology|year= 2008|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn= 1-4051-2556-X|page= 33|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WrRZBOxJzDcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American biblical scholar [[Archibald Thomas Robertson]] stated that the Greek word ''pistis'' used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered "assurance" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is "an old verb meaning "to furnish", used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robertson|first= Archibald Thomas|title= WORD PICTURES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT|pages= Chapter 17|url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/robertson_at/wp_acts.xviii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means "to be persuaded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Price|first= Thomas|title= Faith is about 'just trusting' God isn't It?|url= http://www.bethinking.org/bible-jesus/introductory/faith-is-about-just-trusting-god-isnt-it.htm|accessdate= 23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Christian apologist [[John Lennox]] argues that "faith conceived as belief that lacks warrant is very different from faith conceived as belief that has warrant". He states that "the use of the adjective 'blind' to describe 'faith' indicates that faith is not necessarily, or always, or indeed normally, blind". "The validity, or warrant, of faith or belief depends on the strength of the evidence on which the belief is based." "We all know how to distinguish between blind faith and evidence-based faith. We are well aware that faith is only justified if there is evidence to back it up." "Evidence-based faith is the normal concept on which we base our everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lennox|first= John|title= Gunning for God: Why the New Atheists Are Missing the Target|year=2011|publisher=Lion|location=United kingdom|isbn= 0-7459-5322-0|page= 55|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kxBRhMYsadwC&amp;dq=faith+defined+as+warranted+based+on+evidence&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter S Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterswilliams.com|title=Peter S. Williams|work=peterswilliams.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that "the classic Christian tradition has always valued rationality, and does not hold that faith involves the complete abandonment of reason while believing in the teeth of evidence."{{page needed|date=February 2015}} Quoting Moreland, faith is defined as "a trust in and commitment to what we have reason to believe is true."

Regarding [[doubting Thomas]] in John 20:24-31, Williams points out that "Thomas wasn't asked to believe without evidence". He was asked to believe on the basis of the other disciples' testimony. Thomas initially lacked the first-hand experience of the evidence that had convinced them... Moreover, the reason John gives for recounting these events is that what he saw is evidence... Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples...But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. John 20:30,31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Williams|first=  Peter S|title= A Faithful Guide to Philosophy: A Christian Introduction to the Love of Wisdom|year= 2013|publisher= Authentic Media|isbn= 1-84227-811-8|pages= Chapter 1.4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DCEVL-8d-J4C&amp;dq=A+Faithful+Guide+To+Philosophy:+A+Christian+Introduction+To+The+Love+Of+Wisdom&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[doubting Thomas]], Michael R. Allen wrote, "Thomas's definition of faith implies adherence to conceptual propositions for the sake of personal knowledge, knowledge of and about a person ''qua'' person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Michael|title=The Christ's Faith: A Dogmatic Account|date=2009|publisher=T&amp;T Clark Studies in Systematic Theology|location=London|isbn=978-0-567-03399-4|page=80}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman Jr. describe a classic understanding of faith that is referred to {{by whom|date=February 2015}}as ''[[evidentialism]]'', and which is part of a larger epistemological tradition called ''classical [[foundationalism]]'', which is accompanied by ''[[deontologism]]'', which holds that humans have an obligation to regulate their beliefs in accordance with evidentialist structures.

They show how this can go too far,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Boa|first= Kenneth|author2= Robert M.Bowman|title= Faith Has Its Reasons: Integrative Approaches to Defending the Christian Faith|date= March 1, 2006|publisher= IVP Books|location= USA|isbn= 978-0-8308-5648-0|pages= 253|url= https://www.amazon.com/Faith-Has-Its-Reasons-Integrative/dp/083085648X#reader_083085648X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Plantinga]] deals with it. While Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source (of the truth claims), yet he sees having faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. "Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Plantinga|first= Alvin|title= Warranted Christian Belief|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= USA|isbn= 0-19-513192-4|pages= 250, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catholicism ====

The four-part ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (CCC) gives Part One to "The Profession of Faith".  This section describes the content of faith.  It elaborates and expands particularly upon the [[Apostles' Creed]].  CCC 144 initiates a section on the "Obedience of Faith".

In the [[theology]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], faith is understood in personal terms as a trusting commitment of person to person and thus involves Christian commitment to the divine person of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====

Some alternative, yet impactful, ideas regarding the nature of faith were presented in a collection of sermons now presented as {{cite book|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/lectures-faith-historical-perspective/lectures-faith-1990-edited-version/lecture-1|title=Lectures on Faith|}}

# Lectures 3 and 4 make clear the necessary and unchanging attributes of God; 
# Lecture 5 deals with the nature of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; 
# Lecture 6 proclaims that the willingness to sacrifice all earthly things is prerequisite to gaining faith unto salvation;

=== Hinduism ===
{{Main|Hinduism}}
[[Ahimsa]], also referred to as [[nonviolence]], is the fundamental tenet of Hinduism which advocates harmonious and peaceful co-existence and evolutionary growth in grace and wisdom for all humankind unconditionally.

In Hinduism, most of the Vedic prayers begins with the chants of Om. Om is the Sanskrit symbol that amazingly resonates the peacefulness ensconced within one's higher self. Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Iman (concept)}}
In Islam, a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of [[Islam]] is called "Iman" ({{lang-ar|{{large|الإيمان}}}}), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestionable or blind belief.&lt;ref&gt;Farāhī, Majmū‘ah Tafāsīr, 2nd ed. (Faran Foundation, 1998), 347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick M. Denny, ''An Introduction to Islam, 3rd ed., p. 405''&lt;/ref&gt; A man must build his faith on well-grounded convictions beyond any reasonable doubt and above uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=gLi2X1rzeZIC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=build+his+faith+on+well-grounded+convictions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JAAqmVe6FQ&amp;sig=1rwgFIQDOphU5cSSPyGRBFOtACI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisooTPpZrZAhVFtY8KHavTD10Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=build%20his%20faith%20on%20well-grounded%20convictions&amp;f=false|title=Encountering the World of Islam|last=Swartley|first=Keith E.|date=2005-11-02|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=9780830856442|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to the Quran, Iman must be accompanied by righteous deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into [[Jannah|Paradise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|95|6|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hadith of Gabriel, ''Iman'' in addition to ''Islam'' and ''[[Ihsan]]'' form the three dimensions of the Islamic religion.

[[Muhammad]] referred to the six articles of faith in the [[Hadith of Gabriel]]: "Iman is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God]."&lt;ref&gt;Muslim, Al-Jami‘ al-sahih, 22, (no. 93).&lt;/ref&gt; The first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|8|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|9|24|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish principles of faith}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in [[Judaism]]. The ''faith in God'' is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] Chapter 15 verse 6 and in the [[Book of Exodus]] Chapter 4 verse 31 and in the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, in the 24 books of the [[Jewish Bible]]. The word translated as "faith" here is the Hebrew word אָמַן which can also be translated "believe", "reliable", and "trustworthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/539.htm|title=Strong's Hebrew: 539. אָמַן (aman) -- believe, reliable|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, the commandment to know [[God in Judaism|God]] is followed by the commandments to believe and to understand, thus denoting descending importance.&lt;ref name=beliefInGod&gt;{{cite web|last=Mizrachi|first=Yosef|title=Who God Is|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/who-hashem-is/|work=Audios English 5min:40sec-9min:02sec|publisher=DivineInformation.com|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Judaism does recognize the positive value of ''Emunah''&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1398519/jewish/Emunah.htm |title=What Is Emunah – Beyond Belief – Essentials |work=chabad.org |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (generally translated as faith, trust in God) and the negative status of the ''[[Epikoros|Apikorus]]'' (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in other religions, especially compared with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. It could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true [[knowledge]], true [[Prophecy#Judaism|prophecy]] and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed.&lt;ref name=beliefInGod /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002 /&gt; Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of [[Christian faith]], which is called [[Avodah Zarah]] in Judaism, a minor form of [[idolatry|idol worship]], a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honour a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of [[Jewish principles of faith]] which are mandatory for all (observant) [[Jews]].

In the Jewish scriptures trust in God – ''Emunah'' – refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the [[Torah]], notably&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |year=2002 |title=Reverberations of faith: a theological handbook of Old Testament themes |pages=76–78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=faith+in+the+old+testament |isbn=0-664-22231-5 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 7:9:

{{Quote|text= Know, therefore, that the Lord, your God He is God, the faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and loving kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations.&lt;ref&gt;(The [[Torah]] – A Modern Commentary; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, NY 1981 by W. G. Plaut)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Tanakh]]|source={{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|7:9|JPR}}}}

The specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, [[Orthodox Jew]]s have accepted [[Maimonides]]' Thirteen Principles of Belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html The 13 Principles and the Resurrection of the Dead] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208182008/http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html |date=2006-02-08 }} from ''The Wolf Shall Lie With the Lamb'', Rabbi Shmuel Boteach (Oxford University)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a wide history of this dispute see: Shapiro, Marc: ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised'' (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (Series).)&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional example of ''Emunah'' as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of [[Abraham]]. On a number of occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible (see [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12-15).
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Talmud]] describes how a thief also believes in G‑d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life—and the life of his victim—he cries out with all sincerity, 'G‑d help me!' The thief has faith that there is a G‑d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G‑d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G‑d’s will by stealing from others. For ''emunah'' to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation."&lt;ref name="chabad" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
{{Main|Sikhism|Five Ks}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or [[Five Ks]] (in Punjabi known as pañj kakkē or pañj kakār), are sometimes referred to as the ''Five articles of Faith''. The articles include ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kēs]]'' (uncut hair), ''[[Kanga (Sikhism)|kaṅghā]]'' (small wooden comb), ''[[Kara (Sikhism)|kaṛā]]'' (circular steel or iron bracelet), ''[[kirpan|kirpān]]'' (sword/dagger), and ''[[kaccha|kacchera]]'' (special undergarment). Baptised [[Sikhs]] are bound to wear those five articles of faith, at all times, to save them from bad company and keep them close to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1193703788&amp;ucat=5|title=Sikhism: Five Articles of Faith|work=realsikhism.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemological validity ==
There is a wide spectrum of opinion with respect to the [[epistemological]] validity of faith&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-065292-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[C.S. Lewis|Lewis, C.S.]] |title=[[Mere Christianity]]: a revised and amplified edition, with a new introduction, of the three books, Broadcast talks, Christian behaviour, and Beyond personality |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=[[San Francisco]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-06-065292-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; - that is, whether it is a reliable way to acquire true beliefs.

=== Fideism ===
{{Main|Fideism}}
Fideism is an [[epistemology|epistemological theory]] which maintains that faith is independent of [[reason]], or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular [[truth]]s (see [[natural theology]]). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of [[Catholic]] thought, in a movement called [[Traditionalism (Catholicism)|Traditionalism]]. The Roman Catholic [[Magisterium]] has, however, repeatedly condemned [[fideism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/|title=Fideism|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===
[[Religious epistemology|Religious epistemologists]] have formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/relig-ep/ |title=Religious Epistemology |author=Clark, Kelly James |date=2 October 2004 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[William James]] offers a similar argument in his lecture ''[[The Will to Believe]].''&lt;ref name=InternetReligious /&gt;&lt;ref name=WillToBelieve&gt;{{cite journal |last=James |first=William |title=1896 |journal=New World |volume=5 |pages=327–347 |url=http://educ.jmu.edu//~omearawm/ph101willtobelieve.html |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundationalism]] is a view about the structure of justification or [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="InternetFoundational"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/found-ep/ |title=Foundationalism |author=Poston, Ted |date=10 June 2010 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InternetFoundational" /&gt; Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and [[Theory of justification|justified belief]] are ultimately based upon what are called [[Basic belief|properly basic beliefs]]. This position is intended to resolve the [[Regress argument|infinite regress]] problem in [[epistemology]]. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of [[reformed epistemology]].&lt;ref name=InternetFoundational /&gt;

Reformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] develop this view.&lt;ref name=Plantinga1983&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |author2=Nicholas Wolterstorff |year=1983 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |isbn=0-268-00964-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga holds that an individual may rationally believe in God even though the individual does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and [[fideism]] is that the former requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=StanfordReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/ |title=The Epistemology of Religion |author=Forrest, Peter |date=11 March 2009 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga has developed reformed epistemology in ''Warranted Christian Belief'' as a form of [[externalism]] that holds that the [[Theory of justification|justification]] conferring factors for a belief may include external factors.&lt;ref name=Plantinga2000&gt;{{cite book |title=Warranted Christian Belief |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-513192-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Theism|theistic]] philosophers have defended theism by granting [[evidentialism]] but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive, or in the sense of having a [[probability|mathematical probability]] assigned to them.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious /&gt; Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]], whose arguments are based on [[Bayesian probability]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell1973&gt;{{cite book |title=The Justification of Religious Belief |last=Basic |first=Mitchell |authorlink=Basil Mitchell (academic) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1979&gt;{{cite book |title=The Existence of God |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.&lt;ref name=Forrest1996&gt;{{cite book |title=God without the Supernatural |last=Forrest |first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Forrest (philosopher) |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1997&gt;{{cite book |title=Is there a God? |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professor of Mathematics]] and [[philosopher of science]] at [[University of Oxford]] [[John Lennox]] has stated, "Faith is not a leap in the dark; it’s the exact opposite. It’s a commitment based on [[evidence]]… It is irrational to reduce all faith to blind faith and then subject it to ridicule. That provides a very anti-intellectual and convenient way of avoiding intelligent discussion.” He criticises [[Richard Dawkins]] as a famous proponent of asserting that faith equates to holding a belief without evidence, thus that it is possible to hold belief without evidence, for failing to provide evidence for this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lennox|first=John|title=God's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?|publisher=Lion UK|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=May 2018}}

=== Criticism ===
[[Bertrand Russell]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. [http://www.skeptic.ca/Russell_Religious_Faith.htm "Will Religious Faith Cure Our Troubles?"]. ''Human Society in Ethics and Politics''. Ch 7. Pt 2. Retrieved 16 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Christians hold that their faith does good, but other faiths do harm. At any rate, they hold this about the communist faith. What I wish to maintain is that all faiths do harm. We may define “faith” as a firm belief in something for which there is no evidence. Where there is evidence, no one speaks of “faith.” We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round. We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence. The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to lead to strife, since different groups substitute different emotions. Christians have faith in the Resurrection; communists have faith in [[Labor theory of value|Marx’s Theory of Value]]. Neither faith can be defended rationally, and each therefore is defended by propaganda and, if necessary, by war.| Will Religious Faith Cure Our Troubles?}}

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|publisher=Bantam Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, has no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.&lt;ref name="Is Science a Religion?"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawkins, Richard |date=January–February 1997 |url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |title=Is Science a Religion? |accessdate=15 March 2008 |publisher=American Humanist Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030144700/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which "claims about the world are likely true". Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives as an example of the belief held by that Muslims that [[Muhammad]] (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that [[Joseph Smith]] (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no "built-in corrective mechanism". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as "belief without evidence" or "pretending to know things you don't know".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Manual for Creating Atheists |author=Peter Boghossian |year=2013 |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |isbn=978-1-939578-09-9 |page=31}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freethought''' (or "free thought")&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt; is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[point of view (philosophy)|viewpoint]] which holds that positions regarding [[truth]] should be formed on the basis of [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[empiricism]], rather than [[authority]], [[tradition]], [[revelation]], or [[dogma]]. In particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker|title=Freethinker – Definition of freethinker by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/free+thought|title=Free thought – Define Free thought at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117115830/http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cognitive]] application of freethought is known as "freethinking", and practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |title=Nontracts |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to indicate people who inquired into the basis of traditional religious beliefs.

==Definition==
Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry,]] and logic. The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], or [[sectarianism]].

Modern freethinkers consider freethought as a natural freedom of all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freethinkers.com/who-are-the-freethinkers/|title=who are the Freethinkers?|work=Freethinkers.com|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist author Adam Lee defines freethought as thinking which is independent of revelation, tradition, established belief, and [[argument from authority|authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2010/02/what-is-freethought/|title=What Is Freethought?|work=Daylight Atheism|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as a "broader umbrella" than atheism "that embraces a rainbow of unorthodoxy, religious dissent, skepticism, and unconventional thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/daylight-atheism/9-great-freethinkers-and-religious-dissenters-in-history|title=9 Great Freethinkers and Religious Dissenters in History|author=Adam Lee|work=Big Think|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic summarizing statement of the essay ''The Ethics of Belief'' by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher [[William Kingdon Clifford]] is: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."&lt;ref&gt;William Kingdon Clifford, ''The Ethics of Belief'' (1879 [1877]).&lt;/ref&gt; The essay became a rallying cry for freethinkers when published in the 1870s, and has been described as a point when freethinkers grabbed the moral high ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Lawrence and Charlotte |date=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Ethics (article on "agnosticism") |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=44 |isbn=9781135350963 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford was himself an organizer of freethought gatherings, the driving force behind the Congress of Liberal Thinkers held in 1878.

Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers typically hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], "No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, [[creed]], or [[messiah]]. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth." and "Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/faq/feeds/item/18391-what-is-a-freethinker|title=What is a Freethinker?  - Freedom From Religion Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote the following in his 1944 essay "The Value of Free Thought:"
{{Quote |text=What makes a freethinker is not his beliefs but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought he finds a balance of evidence in their favour, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}
The whole first paragraph of the essay makes it clear that a freethinker is not necessarily an atheist or an agnostic, as long as he or she satisfies this definition:
{{Quote |text=The person who is free in any respect is free ''from'' something; what is the free thinker free from? To be worthy of the name, he must be free of two things: the force of tradition, and the tyranny of his own passions. No one is ''completely'' free from either, but in the measure of a man's emancipation he deserves to be called a free thinker. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}

[[Fred Edwords]], former executive of the [[American Humanist Association]], suggests that by Russell's definition, [[liberal religion]]ists who have challenged established orthodoxies can be considered freethinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |title=Saga Of Freethought And Its Pioneers |work=American Humanist Association |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715023327/http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |archivedate=15 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, according to Bertrand Russell, atheists and/or agnostics are not necessarily freethinkers. As an example, he mentions [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], whom he compares to a "[[pope]]":
{{Quote |text=what I am concerned with is the doctrine of the modern Communistic Party, and of the Russian Government to which it owes allegiance. According to this doctrine, the world develops on the lines of a Plan called [[Dialectical Materialism]], first discovered by [[Karl Marx]], embodied in the practice of a great state by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and now expounded from day to day by a Church of which Stalin is the Pope. […] Free discussion is to be prevented wherever the power to do so exists; […] If this doctrine and this organization prevail, free inquiry will become as impossible as it was in the middle ages, and the world will relapse into bigotry and obscurantism. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery}}

In the 18th and 19th century, many thinkers regarded as freethinkers were [[deists]], arguing that [[The nature of God in Western theology|the nature of God]] can only be known from a study of nature rather than from religious revelation. In the 18th century, "deism" was as much of a 'dirty word' as "atheism", and deists were often stigmatized as either atheists or at least as freethinkers by their Christian opponents.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to An Account of the Growth of Deism in England (1696) by William Stephens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04679b.htm |title=Deism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Francis |editor-last=Aveling |year=1908 |quote=The deists were what nowadays would be called freethinkers, a name, indeed, by which they were not infrequently known; and they can only be classed together wholly in the main attitude that they adopted, viz. in agreeing to cast off the trammels of authoritative religious teaching in favour of a free and purely rationalistic speculation.... Deism, in its every manifestation was opposed to the current and traditional teaching of revealed religion. |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deists today regard themselves as freethinkers, but are now arguably less prominent in the freethought movement than atheists.

==Symbol==
[[Image:Pansy aka.jpg|thumb|The [[pansy]], symbol of freethought]]

The [[pansy]] serves as the long-established and enduring symbol of freethought; literature of the [[American Secular Union]] inaugurated its usage in the late 1800s. The reasoning behind the pansy as the symbol of freethought lies both in the flower's name and in its appearance. The pansy derives its name from the [[French language|French]] word ''pensée'', which means "thought".  It allegedly received this name because the flower is perceived by some to bear resemblance to a human face, and in mid-to-late summer it nods forward as if deep in thought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120523184444/http://www.ffrf.org/fttoday/1997/june_july97/gaylor.html A Pansy For Your Thoughts, by Annie Laurie Gaylor, Freethought Today, June/July 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-modern movement===
Critical thought has flourished in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, in the repositories of knowledge and wisdom in [[Ireland]] and in the [[Iran]]ian civilizations (for example in the era of [[Omar Khayyám|Khayyam]] (1048–1131) and his unorthodox [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|''Rubaiyat'']] poems), and in other civilizations, such as the Chinese (note for example the seafaring renaissance of the [[Liu_Song_dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasty of 420–479),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song.html Chinese History – Song Dynasty 宋 (www.chinaknowledge.de)]&lt;/ref&gt; and on through [[Heresy|heretical]] thinkers on esoteric [[alchemy]] or [[astrology]], to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]].

French physician and writer [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] celebrated "rabelaisian" freedom as well as good feasting and drinking (an expression and a symbol of freedom of the mind) in defiance of the hypocrisies of [[conformist]] [[orthodoxy]] in his [[utopian]] [[Thelema#Fran.C3.A7ois Rabelais|Thelema]] Abbey (from θέλημα: free "will"), the device of which was ''Do What Thou Wilt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;So had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because free people ... act virtuously and avoid vice. They call this honor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Rabelais's hero [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] journeys to the "Oracle of The Div(in)e Bottle", he learns the lesson of life in one simple word: ''"Trinch!"'', Drink! Enjoy the simple life, learn wisdom and knowledge, as a free human. Beyond puns, irony, and satire, Gargantua's prologue-[[metaphor]] instructs the reader to "break the bone and suck out the substance-full marrow" ("''la substantifique moëlle''"), the core of wisdom.

===Modern movements===
The year 1600 is considered a landmark in the era of modern freethought. It was the year of the execution in Italy of [[Giordano Bruno]], a former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Monk, by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=gatti18&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Hilary|title=Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science: Broken Lives and Organizational Power|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cYumhwTQP8C|accessdate=21 March 2014|quote=For Bruno was claiming for the philosopher a principle of free thought and inquiry which implied an entirely new concept of authority: that of the individual intellect in its serious and continuing pursuit of an autonomous inquiry… It is impossible to understand the issue involved and to evaluate justly the stand made by Bruno with his life without appreciating the question of free thought and liberty of expression. His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=montano1&gt;{{cite book|last=Montano|first=Aniello|title=Le deposizioni davanti al tribunale dell'Inquisizione|date=24 November 2007|publisher=La Città del Sole|location=Napoli|page=71|editor=Antonio Gargano|quote=In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, become increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birx&gt;{{cite news|last=Birx|first=James|title=Giordano Bruno|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mobile Alabama Harbinger|date=11 November 1997|quote=To me, Bruno is the supreme martyr for both free thought and critical inquiry… Bruno's critical writings, which pointed out the hypocrisy and bigotry within the Church, along with his tempestuous personality and undisciplined behavior, easily made him a victim of the religious and philosophical intolerance of the 16th century. Bruno was excommunicated by the Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches for his heretical beliefs. The Catholic hierarchy found him guilty of infidelity and many errors, as well as serious crimes of heresy… Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
The term ''free-thinker'' emerged towards the end of the 17th century in England to describe those who stood in opposition to the institution of the [[Church of England|Church]], and the literal belief in the [[Bible]]. The beliefs of these individuals were centered on the concept that people could understand the world through consideration of nature. Such positions were formally documented for the first time in 1697 by [[William Molyneux]] in a widely publicized letter to [[John Locke]], and more extensively in 1713, when [[Anthony Collins]] wrote his ''Discourse of Free-thinking,'' which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacks the clergy of all churches and it is a plea for [[deism]].

''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' magazine was first published in Britain in 1881.

====France====
In France, the concept first appeared in publication in 1765 when [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Voltaire]] included an article on ''Liberté de penser'' in their [[Encyclopédie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.8:1431:4.encyclopedie0513.4781541|title=ARTFL Encyclopédie Search Results|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European freethought concepts spread so widely that even places as remote as the [[Jotunheimen]], in [[Norway]], had well-known freethinkers such as [[Jo Gjende]] by the 19th century.&lt;ref name="MEMIM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendesheim|url=http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|website=MEMIM|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808194917/http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|archivedate=8 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François-Jean de la Barre|François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre]] (1745–1766) was a young [[France|French]] nobleman, famous for having been [[torture]]d and [[Decapitated|beheaded]] before his body was burnt on a [[pyre]] along with Voltaire's ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]''.  La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a [[Roman Catholic]] religious procession, but the elements of the case were far more complex.&lt;ref name="Gregory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Mary Efrosini|title=Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433103735|page=192|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=9781433103735|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Christian [[religious intolerance]]; La Barre along with [[Jean Calas]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], was championed by Voltaire. A second replacement statue to de la Barre stands nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris]] at the summit of the butte [[Montmartre]] (itself named from the ''Temple of Mars''), the highest point in [[Paris]] and an [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]] street nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]] is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

====Germany====
In Germany, during the period 1815–1848 and before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]], the resistance of citizens against the dogma of the church increased. In 1844, under the influence of [[Johannes Ronge]] and [[Robert Blum]], belief in the [[Rights of Man|rights of man]], tolerance among men, and [[humanism]] grew, and by 1859 they had established the ''Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands'' (literally ''Union of Free Religious Communities of Germany''), an association of persons who consider themselves to be religious without adhering to any established and institutionalized church or sacerdotal cult. This union still exists today, and is included as a member in the umbrella organization of free humanists. In 1881 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Ludwig Büchner]] established the ''Deutscher Freidenkerbund'' ([[German Freethinkers League]]) as the first German organization for [[Atheism|atheists]] and agnostics. In 1892 the ''Freidenker-Gesellschaft'' and in 1906 the ''Deutscher Monistenbund'' were formed.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

Freethought organizations developed the "[[Jugendweihe]]" (literally ''Youth consecration''), a secular "[[confirmation]]" ceremony, and atheist funeral rites.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-472-06938-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese, Dagmar |title=Growing up female in Nazi Germany |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Mich |year=2006 |page=160 |isbn=0-472-06938-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5qA4My-C2nkC&amp;pg=PA160 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union of Freethinkers for Cremation was founded in 1905, and the Central Union of German Proletariat Freethinker in 1908. The two groups merged in 1927, becoming the German Freethinking Association in 1930.&lt;ref name="Reinhalter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Reinhalter|first=Helmut| editors=Bromiley, Geoffrey William; Fahlbusch, Erwin |chapter= Freethinkers|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity |publisher=Wm.

More "bourgeois" organizations declined after [[World War I]], and "proletarian" Freethought groups proliferated, becoming an organization of socialist parties.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt; European socialist freethought groups formed the International of Proletarian Freethinkers (IPF) in 1925.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt; Activists agitated for Germans to disaffiliate from their respective Church and for seculari-zation of elementary schools; between 1919–21 and 1930–32 more than 2.5 million Germans, for the most part supporters of the Social Democratic and Communist parties, gave up church membership.&lt;ref name="lamberti"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lamberti, Marjorie |title=Politics Of Education: Teachers and School Reform in Weimar Germany (Monographs in German History) |publisher=Berghahn Books |location=Providence |year=2004 |page= 185|isbn=1-57181-299-7 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jbmwM4wsMKEC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict developed between radical forces including the Soviet [[League of the Militant Godless]] and Social Democratic forces in Western Europe led by Theodor Hartwig and [[Max Sievers]].&lt;ref name="peris"&gt;{{cite book |author=Peris, Daniel |title=Storming the heavens: the Soviet League of the Militant Godless |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1998 |isbn=0-8014-3485-8 |pages=110–11 |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC2LSv5QNYkC&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 the Soviet and allied delegations, following a walk-out, took over the IPF and excluded the former leaders.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt;
Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, most freethought organizations were banned, though some right-wing groups that worked with so-called ''[[Völkisch]]e Bünde'' (literally ''"ethnic" associations'' with nationalist, xenophobic and very often racist ideology) were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Jochen-Christoph|title=Atheismus und religiöse Indifferenz|editor=Christel Gärtner|publisher=VS Verlag|year=2003|volume=Organisierter Atheismus|isbn=978-3-8100-3639-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXOr4xQFSJsC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====

The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], along with the two Circles of Free Inquiry (Dutch and French speaking), defend the freedom of critical thought, [[Laity|lay]] philosophy and [[ethics]], while rejecting the [[Appeal to authority|argument of authority]].

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, freethought has existed in organized form since the establishment of De Dageraad (now known as [[De Vrije Gedachte]]) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, [[Multatuli]], Adriaan Gerhard and [[Domela Nieuwenhuis]].

In 2009, Frans van Dongen established the Atheist-Secular Party, which takes a considerably restrictive view of religion and public religious expressions.

Since the 19th century, Freethought in the Netherlands has become more well known as a political phenomenon through at least three currents: liberal freethinking, conservative freethinking, and classical freethinking. In other words, parties which identify as freethinking tend to favor non-doctrinal, rational approaches to their preferred ideologies, and arose as secular alternatives to both clerically aligned parties as well as labor-aligned parties. Common themes among freethinking political parties are "freedom", "liberty", and "[[individualism]]".

====United States====
The Free Thought movement first organized itself in the United States as the "Free Press Association" in 1827 in defense of George Houston, publisher of ''The Correspondent'', an early journal of [[Biblical criticism]] in an era when blasphemy convictions were still possible.  Houston had helped found an [[Owenite]] community at Haverstraw, New York in 1826–27.  The short-lived ''Correspondent'' was superseded by the ''Free Enquirer'', the official organ of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] community in Indiana, edited by [[Robert Dale Owen]] and by [[Fanny Wright]] between 1828 and 1832 in New York.  During this time Robert Dale Owen sought to introduce the philosophic skepticism of the Free Thought movement into the [[Working Men's Party (New York)|Workingmen's Party]] in New York City.  The ''Free Enquirer'''s annual civic celebrations of Paine's birthday after 1825 finally coalesced in 1836 in the first national Free Thinkers organization, the "United States Moral and Philosophical Society for the General Diffusion of Useful Knowledge".  It was founded on August 1, 1836, at a national convention at the Lyceum in Saratoga Springs with Isaac S. Smith of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, as president.  Smith was also the 1836 [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]'s candidate for Governor of New York and had also been the Workingmen's Party candidate for Lt. Governor of New York in 1830.  The Moral and Philosophical Society published ''The Beacon'', edited by Gilbert Vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hugins|first= Walter|title= Jacksonian Democracy and the Working Class: A Study of the New York Workingmen's Movement 1829–1837|year= 1960|publisher= Stanford University Press|location= Stanford|pages= 36–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the 19th century saw an [[immigration]] of [[German people|German]] freethinkers and anti-clericalists to the United States (see [[Forty-Eighters]]).  In the United States, they hoped to be able to live by their principles, without interference from government and church authorities.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"&gt;

Many Freethinkers settled in German immigrant strongholds, including [[St. Louis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Texas]], where they founded the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]], Texas, as well as others.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

These groups of German Freethinkers referred to their organizations as ''Freie Gemeinden'', or "free congregations".&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt; The first Freie Gemeinde was established in St. Louis in 1850.&lt;ref name="American Irreligion 1966"&gt;Demerath, N.

Freethinkers tended to be liberal, espousing ideals such as racial, social, and sexual equality, and the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

The "Golden Age of Freethought" in the US came in the late 1800s.  The dominant organization was the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]] which formed in 1876 in Philadelphia. This group re-formed itself in 1885 as the American Secular Union under the leadership of the eminent agnostic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]. Following Ingersoll's death in 1899 the organization declined, in part due to lack of effective [[leadership]].&lt;ref name=ftt&gt;{{cite web|title= National Liberal League|url= http://www.freethought-trail.org/profile.php?By=Person&amp;Page=30|work= The Freethought Trail|publisher= freethought-trail.org|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freethought in the United States declined in the early twentieth century. Its anti-religious views alienated would-be sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The movement also lacked cohesive goals or beliefs. By the early twentieth century, most Freethought congregations had disbanded or joined other mainstream churches.

====Canada====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
In 1873 a handful of secularists founded the earliest known secular organization in [[English Canada]], the Toronto Freethought Association. Reorganized in 1877 and again in 1881, when it was renamed the Toronto Secular Society, the group formed the nucleus of the Canadian Secular Union, established in 1884 to bring together freethinkers from across the country.

A significant number of the early members appear to have come from the educated labour "aristocracy", including Alfred F. Jury, J. Ick Evans and J. I. Livingstone, all of whom were leading labour activists and secularists. The second president of the Toronto association, [[T. Phillips Thompson]], became a central figure in the city's labour and social-reform movements during the 1880s and 1890s and arguably Canada's foremost late nineteenth-century labour intellectual. By the early 1880s scattered freethought organizations operated throughout southern [[Ontario]] and parts of [[Quebec]], eliciting both urban and rural support.

The principal organ of the freethought movement in Canada was ''[[Secular Thought]]'' (Toronto, 1887–1911). Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker [[Charles Watts (secularist) |Charles Watts]] (1835–1906), it came under the editorship of Toronto printer and publisher James Spencer Ellis in 1891 when Watts returned to England.

In 1968 the [[Humanist Association of Canada]] (HAC) formed to serve as an umbrella group for humanists, atheists, and freethinkers, and to champion social justice issues and oppose religious influence on public policy—most notably in the fight to make access to abortion free and legal in Canada. HAC, also known as Humanist Canada, operates as an active voice for humanism in Canada{{cn|date=May 2018}} and supports the activities of groups who wish to raise awareness about secular issues.

The [http://www.secularalliance.ca Canadian Secular Alliance] is an active community.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

====Anarchism====
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
In the United States, "freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker.'' E.C. Walker was co-editor of the freethought/free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''."&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf|title=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|work=Mises Institute|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 143]&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith, and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin´s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and freethinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia" |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–32 |id= |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 |publisher=History of Education Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to "[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |archivedate=2010-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer's ideas, generally, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt;

The '''Great Commandment''' (or '''Greatest Commandment''')&lt;ref&gt;Although most English versions of the Bible use the word "great", (from the Greek feminine ''μεγάλη'' big, great) a few versions change the word to "greatest". See [http://studybible.info/compare/Matthew%2022:36 multi-version comparison of Matthew 22:36.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a name used in the [[New Testament]] to describe the first of two commandments cited by [[Jesus]] in {{bibleref2|Matthew|22:35-40|9|Matthew 22:35–40}} and {{bibleref2|Mark|12:28-34|9|Mark 12:28–34}}. These two commandments are [[paraphrase]]s taken from the [[Old Testament]] and are commonly seen as important to [[Jewish ethics|Jewish]] and [[Christian ethics]].

In Mark, when asked "which is the great commandment in the law?", the [[Greek New Testament]] reports that Jesus answered, "[[Shema Yisrael|Hear, O Israel!]] [[The Lord]] our God, The Lord is One; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind",&lt;ref name="OrigShema"&gt;({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:4–9|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|11:13-21|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Numbers|15:37–41|HE}})&lt;/ref&gt; before also referring to a second commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."&lt;ref name="brotherly love"&gt;({{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|126}})&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Christian denomination]]s consider these two commandments to be the core of correct [[Christianity|Christian]] lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Catholicity"&gt;[http://www.catholicity.com/baltimore-catechism/lesson15.html Catholicity] &amp;ndash; [http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment LDS] &amp;ndash; [http://www.greatbiblestudy.com/two_commandments.php GreatBibleStudy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament accounts==

===Gospel of Matthew===
{{Quote|And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”|{{bibleref2|Matthew| 22:35-40|ESV}}}}

===Gospel of Mark===
In the Gospel of Mark, the [[Shema Yisrael|Shema]] is included:
{{Quote|
And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”|{{bibleref2|Mark|12:28-31|ESV}}}}

===Gospel of Luke===
{{Quote|
And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”  And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.|
{{bibleref2|Luke|10:25-28|ESV}}}}

===Gospel of John===
{{Quote|
When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.' A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”|
{{bibleref2|John|13:31-35|ESV}}}}

And thou shalt love the {{LORD}} thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.|{{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|6:4-5|KJV}}}}

===Leviticus===
{{Quote|&lt;sup&gt;17[a]&lt;/sup&gt; You must not hate your brother in your heart. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;17[b]&lt;/sup&gt; You must surely reprove your fellow citizen &lt;br /&gt; &lt;sup&gt;17[c]&lt;/sup&gt; so that you do not incur sin on account of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18[a] &lt;/sup&gt;You must not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the children of your people, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[18b]&lt;/sup&gt; but you must love your neighbor as yourself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[18c]&lt;/sup&gt; I am the {{LORD}}.|{{bibleref2|Leviticus|19:17-18|NET}}}}

[[Matthew Henry]] sums up the question of which is the great commandment:
{{quote|It was a question disputed among the critics in the [[Law of Moses|Law]]. Some would have the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Law of Circumcision]] to be the Great Commandment, others the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Law of the Sabbath]], others the [[Korban#In Christianity|Law of Sacrifices]], according as they severally stood affected, and spent their zeal; now they would try what Christ said to this question, hoping to incense the people against him, if he should not answer according to the vulgar opinion; and if he should magnify one commandment, they would reflect on him as [[antinomianism|vilifying the rest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mhcw.biblecommenter.com/matthew/22.htm |title=Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible - Matthew 22 |publisher=Mhcw.biblecommenter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311054726/http://mhcw.biblecommenter.com/matthew/22.htm |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Adam Clarke]], in his ''Commentary on the Bible'', wrote:
{{quote|This is the first and great commandment. It is "first and greatest":
#In its ''antiquity''; being as old as the world, and engraved originally on our very nature.
#In its ''dignity''; as directly and immediately proceeding from and referring to God.
#In its ''excellence''; being the commandment of the new covenant, and the very spirit of the Divine adoption.
#In its ''justice''; because it alone renders to God his due, prefers him before all things, and secures to him his proper rank in relation to them.
#In its ''sufficiency''; being in itself capable of making men holy in this life, and happy in the other.
#In its ''fruitfulness''; because it is the root of all commandments, and the fulfilling of the law.
#In its ''virtue and efficacy''; because by this alone God reigns in the heart of humans, and humans are united to God.
#In its ''extent''; leaving nothing to the creature, which it does not refer to the Creator.
#In its ''necessity''; being absolutely indispensable.
#In its ''duration''; being ever to be continued on earth, and never to be discontinued in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Clarke, Commentary on the Bible [http://clarke.biblecommenter.com/matthew/22.htm Adam Clarke 1831 Commentary on the Bible - Matthew 22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829024635/http://clarke.biblecommenter.com/matthew/22.htm |date=2011-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God" is explained to mean "Act in such a manner that God will be beloved by all His creatures."&lt;ref&gt;Sifre, Deut. 32; Yoma 86a&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, [[Israelites|Israel]], being, as the priest-people, enjoined like the [[Kohen|Aaronite priest]] to sanctify the [[JHWH|name of God]] and avoid whatever tends to desecrate it (Lev. xxii. 32), is not only obliged to give his life as witness or martyr for the maintenance of the true faith (see Isa. xliii. 12, μάρτυρες; and Pesik. 102b; Sifra, Emor, ix.), but so to conduct himself in every way as to prevent the name of God from being dishonored by non-Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=499&amp;letter=E |title=Ethics |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twice every day the Jew recites the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'', which contains the words: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might" (Deut. vi. 5). This verse is understood to enjoin him to willingly surrender life and fortune whenever the cause of God demands it, while it at the same time urges him to make God beloved by all his creatures through deeds of kindness, as [[Abraham]] did (Sifre, Deut. 32).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=666&amp;letter=J&amp;search= |title=Judaism |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only asked about the first commandment, Jesus included the second commandment in his answer. This double reference has given rise to differing views with regard to the relationship that exists between the two commandments, although typically "love thy God" is referred to as "the first and greatest commandment", with "love thy neighbour" being referred to as "the second great commandment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.catholicweb.com/4Immaculateconception/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=288819&amp;From=Home |title=catholicweb.com |publisher=Home.catholicweb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408082856/http://home.catholicweb.com/4Immaculateconception/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=288819&amp;From=Home |archivedate=2013-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may simply reflect the "[[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael|seven rules (Middot) of Hillel]]", in this case the first one, called [[A minore ad maius|Ḳal wa-ḥomer]] (Hebrew: קל וחומר).

==Love thy neighbour as thyself==
{{Main|Golden Rule}}
When asked which is the greatest commandment, the ''Christian New Testament'' depicts Jesus paraphrasing the [[Torah]]: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind," before also paraphrasing a second passage; "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Most Christian denominations view these two commandments as, together, forming the core of the Christian religion. The second passage is considered to be a form of the [[Golden Rule#Christianity|Golden Rule]] (circa 1300 BCE).&lt;ref name="Plaut pp.892"&gt;[[Gunther Plaut|Plaut]], ''The Torah&amp;nbsp;— A Modern Commentary''; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York 1981; pp.892.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hierophany''' is a manifestation of the [[sacred]]. The word is a formation of the Greek adjective ''hieros'' ({{lang-gr|ἱερός}}; sacred/holy) and the verb ''phainein'' (φαίνειν; to reveal / to bring to light).

When the sacred is revealed in some form or other to an entity, it brings with it great pleasure and suffering, as one who has become familiar with the [[Divinity|Godhead]] would ascribe. This information can be then used by the recipient to assist others on their own path.

The word ''hierophany'' recurs frequently in the works of the religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]], which he preferred to the more constrictive word ''[[theophany]]'' (an appearance of a god).&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that religion is based on a sharp distinction between the sacred (God, gods, mythical ancestors, etc.) and the profane.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, for traditional man, myths describe "breakthroughs of the sacred (or the 'supernatural') into the World"—that is, hierophanies.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the hierophanies recorded in myth, the sacred appears in the form of ideal models (the actions and commandments of gods, heroes, etc.). By manifesting itself as an ideal model, the sacred gives the world value, direction, and purpose: "The manifestation of the sacred, ontologically founds the world".&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, all things need to imitate or conform to the sacred models established by hierophanies, in order to have true reality: to traditional man, things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Comos and History'', pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of religious pluralism''' is the fruit of a long development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in [[postmodernity]].

==Asia==
===India===
India has been a place of fertile religious endeavour since the latter part of the [[Vedic period]]. Jainism and Buddhism, which were part of the ''[[sramana]]'' movement have been from their inception religions motivated by compassion for all creatures as well as believers in the inherent rationality and reasonableness of true religion. They have thus sought and advocated rational debate concerning matters of truth. India is, in fact, as far as we can tell the home of the first written statement of religious pluralism, tolerance and interfaith dialogue. The [[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict XII]] by the Emperor [[Ashoka]] states the following:

::{{cquote|''The beloved of the gods, King Piyadasi (Ashoka), honors both ascetics and the householders of all religions, and he honors them with gifts and honors of various kinds. But the beloved of the gods, King Piyadasi, does not value gifts and honors as much as he values this - that there should be growth in the essentials of all religions. Growth in essentials can be done in different ways, but all of them have as their root restraint in speech, that is, not praising one's own religion, or condemning the religion of others without good cause. And if there is cause for criticism, it should be done in a mild way. But it is better to honor other religions for this reason. By so doing, one's own religion benefits, and so do other religions, while doing otherwise harms one's own religion and the religions of others. Whoever praises his own religion, due to excessive devotion, and condemns others with the thought "Let me glorify my own religion," only harms his own religion. Therefore contact between religions is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. The beloved of the gods, king Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions.

''Those who are content with their own religion should be told this: the beloved of the gods, King Piyadasi, does not value gifts and honors as much as he values that there should be growth in the essentials of all religions. And to this end many are working - dhamma [[Mahamatra]]s, Mahamatras in charge of the women's quarters, officers in charge of outlying areas, and other such officers. And the fruit of this is that one's own religion grows and the dhamma is illuminated also.''&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Ven S Dhammika&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Religious tolerance was promoted to varying degrees during the course of several [[Muslim]] settlements ([[Delhi Sultanate]] 1276-1526 AD and the [[Mughal Empire]] 1526–1857 AD). In the 8th century, [[Zoroastrianism]] was established in India as Zoroastrians fled from [[Iran|Persia]] to [[India]] in large numbers, where they were given refuge. The colonial phase ushered in by the British lasted until 1947 and furthered conversions to [[Christianity]] among low caste Hindus. In 1948 as many as 20,000 Jews [[Bene Israel|Bene Jews]] and [[Cochin Jews]] lived in India, though most of them have since emigrated to Israel.

Although in [[Japan]] Buddhism and [[Shinto]] have more or less co-existed for centuries, the arrival of Christianity through [[Francis Xavier]] led to widespread persecution of Christians and the eventual exclusion of Christianity for hundreds of years until the [[Meiji era]], as the rulers of Japan saw it as a threat. Christians and Buddhists were also persecuted under [[State Shinto]].

===Mongol Empire===
Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions during the early [[Mongol Empire]], and typically sponsored several at the same time. To avoid strife, Genghis Khan set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom, though he himself was a [[shamanist]]. Under his administration, all religious leaders were exempt from taxation, and from public service.&lt;ref name=Weatherford&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|year=2004|title=Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=0-609-80964-4|ref=harv|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongol emperors were known for organizing competitions of religious debates among clerics, and these would draw large audiences.

==Islamic world==
{{See also|Islamic ethics|Sharia|Islam and other religions|Divisions of the world in Islam}}

Religious pluralism existed in medieval [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic ethics]], as the [[religious law]]s and [[court]]s of other religions, including [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as exemplified in the [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=Weeramantry-138&gt;{{citation|last=Weeramantry|first=Judge Christopher G.|title=Justice Without Frontiers: Furthering Human Rights|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism|first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein|last=Sachedina|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-513991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Islamic societies, the ''[[qadi]]'' (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily choose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the ''[[dhimmi]]'' communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who would have their own ''[[Halakha]]'' courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R. Cohen]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgbib5exskUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&amp;q|accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic empires allowed non-believers to have their own laws and courts in exchange for a [[Jizya]] poll tax.

Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order.&lt;ref name = "al-Qattan-99"&gt;{{Citation | first=Najwa | last= al-Qattan | title= Dhimmis in the Muslim Court: Legal Autonomy and Religious Discrimination | journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=429–444 | publisher=University of Cambridge |year=1999 | doi=10.1017/S0020743800055501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of [[alcohol]] and [[pork]], as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292-1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A.

==Europe==

===Antiquity===
The polytheistic [[Roman empire]] saw the traditional Roman religion as one fundamentals of the Roman republic. They saw Roman virtues as an important link in their multi-ethnic empire. Being polytheistic, Romans did not mind if conquered nations went on worshiping their traditional gods, as long as they also presented token offerings to the Roman gods. In many cases this compromise was easily reached by identifying the traditional gods with similar Roman gods.  Failure to offer up this token worship was seen as disloyal to Rome, and an act of political rebellion against the Emperor. 

There was, though, a problem with people whose religion excluded the veneration of other gods - especially the Jews and the Christians. The Romans tended to view this as rebellion, and so it resulted in many conflicts arising from often unintended offenses, like putting a statue of an emperor in a prominent place in [[Jerusalem]] which resulted in a public revolt. Similarly difficult to understand for the Roman mindset was the attitude of Christians who rather chose [[torture]] or [[death]] instead of offering [[incense]] to the Roman emperor. From the Roman view, the refusal to venerate the Roman emperor was political treason.

The [[edict of Milan]] which decreed tolerance of Christianity was followed by a time of parallel existence of Christianity and paganism which was, though, far from an actual religious pluralism - the religion of the emperor was always at an advantage, and the [[Arianism|Arian]], [[Trinity|trinitarian]] and pagan emperors in the fourth century saw it as perfectly legitimate to take measures against religious leaders who did not share their belief.  By the fifth century, the western Roman Empire had crumbled, but the same patterns of behavior continued in the eastern Roman Empire along with the Gaulish, Celtic, and Germanic kingdoms that replaced the west.

===Middle Ages===
After the breakdown of the Roman Empire in the west, in western Europe the population was a huge, diverse mix of Latin peoples, Germanic peoples who had been absorbed into the Empire and its Legions over the course of hundreds of years, and newly arriving Germanic tribes that were migrating into western Europe.  In each of these vaguely defined categories were some Christians, some pagans, and some who subscribed to some elements of both. In the German tradition, the chief of the tribe was also religious leader, so conversion of the leaders (even if for political reasons) was followed in many cases by Christianization of the tribe - with the chief of the tribe being now the de facto head of the Christian church. There were very frequent instances of parallel pagan and Christian religion, but tolerance of old or new religion was up to the personal preference of the local lord.  

The tradition of the head of the tribe as head of the church was continued by the Kings which these chieftains eventually evolved into, with the king and/or emperor holding by virtue of office the right of investiture of [[bishop]]s and also of deciding in religious matters - [[Charlemagne]], e.g., took the [[Pope]] to task for not using the [[Filioque clause|filioque]] in the [[Nicene Creed]]. The religion of the ruler was the official religion of the people and, again, any tolerance of foreigners or remnants of pagans was up to the present ruler. The unity of religion was generally seen as a prerequisite for any worldly state - a divergent religion was in the consequence not regarded just as a religious problem but also an action against state and ruler punishable by criminal law.

In the high Middle Ages, the worldly powers clashed with the power of the pope on the matter of deciding about religious questions - 
while the details varied by country, the overall result was that the Roman Catholic Church was able to, for a short time, exercise control over the religious practices of countries, even against that Ruler's will.

===Protestant Reformation===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation }}
The Protestant Reformation broke away from the Catholic Church over religious policy and belief in Europe and touched off the [[30-years War]] which involved virtually every nation on the European continent.  Much of the fighting occurred between German and Swiss nobility who had sided with [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]'s Protestant movement, and French and Spanish forces under the command of the then-French Papacy.  After the religious wars, the general rule was "cuius regio, eius religio" - the countries and principalities had to adopt the religion of their respective ruler, while divergent people were left with the choice between submission or [[emigration]].

Restrictions on smaller Protestant sects who disagreed with the national churches in these countries prompted such groups as the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] to seek freedom in [[North America]], although when these became the majority they sometimes sought to deny this freedom to Jews and Roman Catholics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In [[Transylvania]] it was declared in 1568 at [[Turda]] the [[religious tolerance]] for every religion and it was realised the religious pluralism. The role of authority was to supervise the peaceful religious cohabitation between Catholics, Calvinist, Lutheran, antirtinitarians, orthodox, sabbatharians, Jews and Muslims. The Transylvanian situation remained for long time an isolated fearful model of "diabolic liberty" (Beze, Basel,1569)but was well known and appreciated between religious persecuted antitrinitarians in Holland and in England.

===Enlightenment===

{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
In the second half of the seventeenth century, partially out of being tired with the religious wars, partially influenced by early enlightenment, several countries adopted some sort of tolerance for other denominations, e.g. the [[Peace of Westphalia]] 1653 or the [[Edict of toleration|Edict of Tolerance]] in England in 1689.

Protestant and freethinking philosophers like [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Paine]], who argued for tolerance and moderation in religion, were strongly influential on the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], and the modern religious freedom and equality underlying religious pluralism in the [[United States]] are guaranteed by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], which states:

:"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

In the United States religious pluralism can be said to be overseen by the secular state, which guarantees equality under law between different religions, whether these religion have a handful of adherents or many millions. The state also guarantees the freedom of those who choose not to belong to any religion. 

While the United States had to begin with no dominant religion or denomination, this was very different in European countries who have, except for some Balkan states, a history with one dominant Christian denomination whose influence on their culture is felt until present times. Enlightenment in Europe did not so much promote the rights of minority religions but the rights of individuals to express beliefs diverging from the mainstream religion of the country, while belonging to that religion or being outside of it. While European countries generally went the way of gradually increasing the rights for minority denominations and religions, up to today the stress has been more on the freedom of belief of the individual, whereas the rights of religious organizations are often limited by the state to prevent them intruding upon the individual religious freedom.

The '''International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation''' ('''IHEYO''') is the [[youth wing]] of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), founded in 2002{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}. It aims to network young humanists around the world together, support training and promote humanist values for the age category of 18–35. It is an umbrella organisation representing around 40,000 young people&lt;ref name=Singapore&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://humanist.org.sg/ahc/about-iheyo-and-iheu/ |title=About IHEYO and IHEU |work=Humanist Society Singapore website |accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the world.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iheu.org/ihey/iheyo-about/ |title=About IHEYO |work=IHEYO website |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
[[File:IHEYO East European conference 2.png|left|thumb|IHEYO East European Conference in Bucharest, Romania in 2015.]]
The International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation (IHEYO) is the international umbrella organisation for Humanist youth organisations. IHEYO's main identity is to bring into active association youth groups and young humanist individuals throughout the world interested in promoting humanism, as is described in the IHEU [[Amsterdam Declaration]] 2002. IHEYO brings together people who describe themselves as humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, skeptics and similar views.

The vision of IHEYO is to give a voice to young humanists within the mission of IHEU. The mission of IHEU is to build and represent the global humanist movement that defends human rights and promotes humanist values worldwide. IHEYO does this by organising international networking events, offering training, connecting youth through social media and by its work in regional working groups. These activities empower IHEYO’s members to achieve their individual, local and regional goals.&lt;ref name=Singapore/&gt;

IHEYO members form the young humanist communities and campaign for political and cultural change in a diverse range of areas such as [[religious freedom]], [[women's rights]], [[education rights]], [[abortion rights]], [[LGBTIQ rights]], [[equal opportunity|equality]], [[human rights]], [[freedom of speech]]/[[Freedom of thought|thought/belief]], [[science communication|public communication of science]].&lt;ref name=Singapore/&gt;

== History ==
IHEYO was formally established in 2003, but it was not completely a 21st-century construct. The first version of IHEYO was launched in 1966, and lasted around ten years. In the ‘80s, it was again revived for a similar period of time. But it was not until 2001, when the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) started an internship programme, that the idea of re-establishing IHEYO as an international humanist youth network was revived in a lasting way.

== Structure ==
[[File:Washington May 2015.jpg|thumb|Americas WG launch event in Washington, DC 2015.]]
[[File:IHEYO Asian Working Group training.png|thumb|Asian WG training in Singapore, 2015.]]
IHEYO's Working Groups are the forum through which Humanist organisations can get in touch and work together with others in the same region. There are four Working Groups: the Asian Humanist Alliance, African Working Group, European Working Group and Americans Working Group.

=== African Working Group ===
The African Working Group (in short: AfWG)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/groups/468425919945991/ African Working Group on Facebook]&lt;br&gt;{{Twitter|https://twitter.com/IheyoAfWG|African Working Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; of IHEYO was established around 2005. It organises regional meetings in East and West Africa. The African Working Group is mainly organised in East Africa (Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, etc.) and West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Cameroon, etc.). The Fourth Annual IHEYO East African Regional Working Group Meeting was held in Kigali on 26–28 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rice |first=Lily |date=October 2015 |title=Learning humanism in Uganda |url=http://www.haleauganda.org/magazine/HALEA%20Magazine%20October.pdf |journal=Open Talk Magazine |publisher=Humanist Association for Leadership, Equity and Accountability |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=14 |accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Americas Working Group ===
The American Working group is the newest and launched in Washington DC in May 2015 at the Future of Ethical Societies Annual conference.&lt;ref name="Future of Ethical Societies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeu.org/our-community/future-of-ethical-societies/ |title=Future of Ethical Societies |website=American Ethical Union|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This working group covered Canada, the United States of America, Central America and South America.

=== Asian Humanist Alliance (Asian Working Group) ===
The Asian Working Group is a joint humanist effort in this continent to foster humanist values and ideas.  Since its inception in 2007, it has published information −bulletins, has had regular meetings and organised events. The Working Group has members in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines.

=== European Working Group ===
The European Working group (EWG) combines all IHEYO member organisations in Europe. The EWG has annual face-to-face meetings to coordinate the international exchanges taking place at events organised in Europe, including the European Humanist Youth Days (EHYD).&lt;ref name="EHYD"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehyd.eu/ |title=European Humanist Youth Days |work=EHYD website |publisher=IHEYO |accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jainism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|n|ɪ|z|əm}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Jainism" (ODE)|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Jainism|website=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally known as '''''Jain Dharma''''',{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=15}} is an ancient [[Indian religions|Indian religion]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=185, Quote: "Jainism is an ancient Indian religion and from ancient times to the present day, it has continued to flourish, along with other religions, in different parts of India".}} Followers of Jainism are called "Jains", a word derived from the Sanskrit word ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|jina]]'' (victor) and connoting the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths through an ethical and spiritual life&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tirthankara Tirthankara: Jainism], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Jains trace their history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as ''[[tirthankara]]s'', with the first being [[Rishabhanatha]], who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, and twenty-fourth being the [[Mahāvīra]] around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]'' with the ''tirthankaras'' guiding every cycle of the [[Jain cosmology]].

The main religious premises of Jainism are ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence"), ''[[Anekantavada|anekāntavāda]]'' ("many-sidedness"), ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-attachment") and ''[[asceticism]]''. Devout Jains take five main vows: ''[[Ahimsa|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence"), ''[[satya]]'' ("truth"), ''[[asteya]]'' ("not stealing"), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' ("celibacy or chastity"), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-attachment"). These principles have impacted Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. ''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam|Parasparopagraho Jīvānām]]'' ("the function of souls is to help one another") is the motto of Jainism. ''[[Namokar Mantra|Ṇamōkāra mantra]]'' is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism.{{sfn|Voorst|2015|p=107}}

Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, [[Digambara]]s and [[Śvētāmbara]]s; and several smaller sub-traditions that emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical. [[Jain monasticism|Jain mendicants]] are found in all Jain sub-traditions, with [[Laity|laypersons]] (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvakas]]'') supporting the mendicants' spiritual pursuits with resources.

Jainism has between four and five million followers, with most Jains residing in [[Jainism in India|India]].{{sfn|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=lix, 1395}} Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities are present in [[Jainism in Canada|Canada]], [[Jainism in Europe|Europe]], [[Jainism in Africa|Kenya]], the [[Jainism in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Jainism in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Suriname]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Jainism in the United States|United States]]. Major Jain festivals include [[Paryushana]] and Daslakshana, [[Mahavir Jayanti]], and [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].

==Main principles==
===Non-violence (''ahimsa'')===
{{anchor|ahiṃsā}}{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Ahinsa Parmo Dharm.jpg|thumb|Painting with the message ''Ahiṃsā Paramo [[Dharma (Jainism)|Dharma]]'' ("non-violence is the highest virtue or religion")]]

[[File:Ahimsa.svg|thumb|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes [[Ahimsa in Jainism|''Ahiṃsā'' in Jainism]]. The word in the middle is ''ahiṃsā''. The wheel represents the ''[[dharmachakra]]'', which stands for the resolve to halt the ''saṃsāra'' ('transmigration') through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]

The principle of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' ("non-violence" or "non-injury") is a fundamental tenet of Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} It believes that one must abandon all violent activity, and without such a commitment to non-violence all religious behavior is worthless.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and "non-violence is one's highest religious duty".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}}

Jain texts such as ''[[Acharanga Sutra|Acaranga Sūtra]]'' and ''[[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvarthasūtra]]'' state that one must renounce all killing of living beings, whether tiny or large, movable or immovable.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}} Its theology teaches that one must neither kill another living being, nor cause another to kill, nor consent to any killing directly or indirectly.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}} Furthermore, Jainism emphasizes non-violence against all beings not only in action but also in speech and in thought.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}} It states that instead of hate or violence against anyone, "all living creatures must help each other".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}}{{refn|group=note|This view, however, is not shared by all Jain sub-traditions. For example, the Terapanthi Jain tradition, with about 250,000 followers, considers both good karma such as compassionate charity, and bad karma such as sin, as binding one's soul to worldly morality. It states that any karma leads to a negation of the "absolute non-violence" principle, given man's limited perspective. It recommends that the monk or nun seeking salvation must avoid hurting or helping any being in any form.{{sfn|Flügel|2002|pp=1266-1267}}}} Violence negatively affects and destroys one's soul, particularly when the violence is done with intent, hate or carelessness, or when one indirectly causes or consents to the killing of a human or non-human living being.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}}

The idea of reverence for non-violence (''ahiṃsā'') is founded in Hindu and Buddhist canonical texts, and it may have origins in more ancient [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanical]] Vedic thoughts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}&lt;ref&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Izawa (2008), Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual, Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, Kokusai Bukkyōgaku Daigakuin Daigaku, Vol. 12, pages 78-81&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other Indian religion has developed the non-violence doctrine and its implications on everyday life as has Jainism.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|p=2}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=176–177}}{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=408–409}}

The theological basis of non-violence as the highest religious duty has been interpreted by some Jain scholars not to "be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures, nor a duty to rescue all creatures", but resulting from "continual self-discipline", a cleansing of the soul that leads to one's own spiritual development which ultimately affects one's salvation and release from rebirths.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=88–89, 257–258}} Causing injury to any being in any form creates bad [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] which affects one's rebirth, future well being and suffering.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The violence of non-violence: a study of some Jain responses to non-Jain religious practices |journal=The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies| volume=15| year= 1992| number = 1|author=Phyllis Granoff|url= https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8791/2698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late medieval Jain scholars re-examined the ''Ahiṃsā'' doctrine when one is faced with external threat or violence. For example, they justified violence by monks to protect nuns.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}}{{sfn|Lorenzen|1978|pp=61–75}} According to Dundas, the Jain scholar Jinadatta Suri wrote during a time of Muslim destruction of temples and persecution that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody would not lose any spiritual merit but instead attain deliverance".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=163}} However, such examples in Jain texts that condone fighting and killing under certain circumstances are relatively rare.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}}{{refn|group=note|Jain literature, like Buddhist and Hindu literature, has also debated the aspects of violence and non-violence in food creation.{{sfn|Olson|2014|pp=1–7}}}}

===Many-sided reality (''anekāntavāda'')===
{{Main|Anekāntavāda}}
The second main principle of Jainism is ''anekāntavāda'' or ''anekantatva'',{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}} a word derived from ''anekānta'' ("not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness" or "manifoldness") and ''vada'' ("doctrine", "way").{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}}&lt;ref name="grimes34"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 34; {{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Mystical Experience and Religious Doctrine: An Investigation of the Study of Mysticism in World Religions|url={{Google books|CBSn4dR087YC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=1982|publisher= Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-279-3160-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is ''Naya'', explained as "partial expression of the truth".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}} Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express Truth. From Truth, according to Mahāvīra, language returns and not the other way round.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}&lt;ref name=iepmahav/&gt; One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is ''syāt'', or valid "in some respect" but it remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".&lt;ref name=iepmahav&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ Jain philosophy], IEP, Mark Owen Webb, Texas Tech University&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, and language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}} Since reality is many-sided the great error, according to Jainism, is ''ekānta'' (one-sidedness) where some relative truth is treated as an absolute truth to the exclusion of others.&lt;ref name="The Metaphysics of Paradox"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Wm. Andrew |title=The Metaphysics of Paradox: Jainism, Absolute Relativity, and Religious Pluralism |date=2018 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9781498563925 |url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498563925/The-Metaphysics-of-Paradox-Jainism-Absolute-Relativity-and-Religious-Pluralism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anekāntavāda'' premise of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahāvīra's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (''syāt'').{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301–305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205–218}} These texts identify ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Mahāvīra and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Mahāvīra, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is", and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}} ''Syādvāda'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''nayavāda'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anekāntavāda''. ''Syādvāda'' recommends the expression of ''anekānta'' by prefixing the epithet ''syād'' to every phrase or expression describing the "permanent being".{{sfn|Koller|2000|pp=400–407}}{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=48-51}} There is no creator God in Jainism; existence has neither beginning nor end, and the permanent being is conceptualized as ''jiva'' ("soul") and ''ajiva'' ("matter") within a dualistic ''anekāntavāda'' framework.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90–99, 104–105, 229–233}}

According to Paul Dundas, in contemporary times the ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". Dundas states this is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahāvīra's teachings.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahāvīra is a doctrine about the nature of [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute reality]] and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=86-91}} However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, nor violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps" or "that is just one perspective" about them.{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98–106}} Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}

===Non-attachment (''aparigraha'')===
{{anchor|aparigraha}}{{Main|Aparigraha}}

The third main principle in Jainism is ''aparigraha'' which means non-attachment to worldly possessions.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}} For ascetics, Jainism requires a vow of complete non-possession of any property. For Jain laypersons, it recommends limited possession of property that has been honestly earned, and giving excess property to charity.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}} According to Natubhai Shah, ''aparigraha'' applies to both the material and the psychic. Material possessions refer to various forms of property. Psychic possessions refer to emotions, likes and dislikes, and attachments of any form. Unchecked attachment to possessions is said to result in direct harm to one's personality.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=112-113}}

Jainism views attachments to material or emotional possessions as what leads to passions, which in turn leads to violence.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} According to the ''aparigraha'' principle, a Jain monk or nun is expected to be homeless and family-less with no emotional longings or attachments.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=117, 152}} The ascetic is a wandering mendicant in the Digambara tradition, or a resident mendicant in the [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=117, 152}}

In addition, Jain texts mention that "attachment to possessions" (''parigraha'') is of two kinds: attachment to internal possessions (''ābhyantara parigraha''), and attachment to external possessions (''bāhya parigraha'').{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=76}} For internal possessions, Jainism identifies four key passions of the mind (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kashaya]]''): anger, pride (ego), deceitfulness, and greed. In addition to the four passions of the mind, the remaining ten internal passions are: wrong belief, the three sex-passions (male sex-passion, female sex-passion, neuter sex-passion), and the six defects (laughter, like, dislike, sorrow, fear, disgust).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=77}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=118–119}}

===Jain ethics and five vows===
{{Main|Ethics of Jainism}}
{{see also|Yamas#Five Yamas}}

Jainism teaches five ethical duties, which it calls five vows. These are called ''anuvratas'' ("small vows") for Jain laypersons, and ''mahavratas'' ("great vows") for Jain mendicants.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}} For both, its moral precepts preface that the Jain has access to a ''[[guru]]'' ("teacher", "counsellor"), ''deva'' ("Jina", "god"), doctrine, and that the individual is free from five offences: doubts about the faith, indecisiveness about the truths of Jainism, sincere desire for Jain teachings, recognition of fellow Jains, and admiration for their spiritual pursuits.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} Such a person undertakes the following Five vows of Jainism:
# ''[[Ahiṃsā]]'', "intentional non-violence" or "noninjury":{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} The first major vow taken by Jains is to cause no harm to other human beings, as well as all living beings (particularly animals).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} This is the highest ethical duty in Jainism, and it applies not only to one's actions, but demands that one be non-violent in one's speech and thoughts.&lt;ref name=pkshah5v&gt;{{citation |last=Shah |first=Pravin K | title=Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas) of Jainism |url= http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm |publisher=Harvard University Literature Center |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vijay K.

# ''[[Brahmacharya]]'', "celibacy": Abstinence from sex and sensual pleasures is prescribed for Jain monks and nuns. For laypersons, the vow means chastity, faithfulness to one's partner.&lt;ref name=pkshah5v/&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}}
# ''[[#aparigraha|Aparigraha]]'', "non-possessiveness": This includes non-attachment to material and psychological possessions, avoiding craving and greed.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}} Jain monks and nuns completely renounce property and social relations, own nothing and are attached to no one.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}}{{sfn|Long|2009|p=109}}

==Practices==
===Asceticism===
{{Main|Asceticism}}
Of all the major Indian religions, Jainism has had the strongest austerity-driven ascetic tradition, and it is an essential part of a mendicant's spiritual pursuits.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=118-122}}{{sfn|Caillat|2003b|p=113}}{{sfn|Flügel|2003|pp=169-174, 178-198 with footnotes}} Ascetic life may include nakedness symbolizing non-possession of even clothes, fasting, body mortification, penance, and other austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, both of which are believed in Jainism to be essential for reaching ''siddha'' and ''moksha'' ("liberation from rebirths", and "salvation").{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=118-122}}{{sfn|Fujinaga|2003|pp=205-212 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=144–150}}

Jain texts like ''Tattvartha Sūtra'' and ''Uttaradhyayana Sūtra'' discuss ascetic austerities to great lengths and formulations. Six outer and six inner practices are most common, and oft-repeated in later Jain texts.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-121}} According to John Cort, outer austerities include complete fasting, eating limited amounts, eating restricted items, abstaining from tasty foods, mortifying the flesh, and guarding the flesh (avoiding anything that is a source of temptation).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-122}} Inner austerities include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation, and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-122}}

Lists of internal and external austerities in Jainism varies with the text and tradition.{{sfn|Flügel|2003|p=182 with footnote 3}}{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=196–197}} Asceticism is viewed as a means to control desires, and a means to purify the ''jiva'' ("soul").{{sfn|Flügel|2003|pp=169-174, 178-198 with footnotes}} The ''tirthankaras'' of Jainism, such as the Mahāvīra (Vardhamana) set an example of leading an ascetic life by performing severe austerities for twelve years.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=121-122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Jain|first1=Shanti Lal|title=ABC of Jainism|year=1998|publisher=Jnanodaya Vidyapeeth |isbn=81-7628-0003|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=15–18, 41–43}}

===Food and fasting===
{{Main|Jain vegetarianism|Fasting in Jainism}}

The practice of non-violence towards all living beings has led to Jain culture being [[Jain vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Devout Jains practice [[lacto-vegetarianism]], that is eat no eggs, but accept dairy products if there is no violence against animals during their production. [[Veganism]] is encouraged if there are concerns about animal welfare.{{sfn|Voorst|2015|p=105}} Jain monks and nuns do not eat [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]] such as potatoes, onions and garlic because tiny organisms are injured when the plant is pulled up, and because a bulb or tuber's ability to sprout is seen as characteristic of a higher living being.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=260}}{{refn|group=note|In Jainism, the ''ahiṃsā'' precept for a mendicant requires avoidance of touching or disturbing any living being including plants. It also mandates never swimming in water, nor lighting or fire or extinguish one, nor thrashing arms in the air as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}}}

Jains fast on different occasions throughout the year, particularly during festivals.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} This practice is called ''upavasa'', ''tapasya'' or ''vrata''.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=85-86}} According to Singh, this takes on various forms and may be practised based on one's ability.{{sfn|Ram Bhushan Prasad Singh|2008|pp=92–94}} Some examples include Digambara fasting for ''Dasa-laksana-parvan'' where a Jain layperson eats only one or two meals per day, drinking only boiled water for ten days, or fasting completely on the first and last day of the festival.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=72}} With these practices the layperson mimics the practices of a Jain mendicant during the festival.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=72}} A similar practice is found among Śvētāmbara Jains on eight day ''paryusana'' with ''samvatsari-pratikramana''.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=72, 85-86}}

The fasting practice is believed to remove karma from one's soul and allow one to gain merit (''punya'').{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} A "one day" fast in Jain tradition lasts about 36 hours, starting at sunset before the day of the fast and ending 48 minutes after the sunrise the day after.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} Among laypeople, fasting is more commonly observed by women, where it is believed that this shows her piety, religious purity, gains her and her family prestige, leads to merit earning and helps ensure future well-being for her family. Some religious fasts are observed as a group where Jain women bond socially and support each other.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=86}} Long fasts are celebrated by friends and families with special ceremonies.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=86}}

Jainism considers meditation (''dhyana'') a necessary practice, but its goals are very different from those in Buddhism and Hinduism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}} In Jainism, meditation is concerned more with stopping karmic attachments and activity, not as a means to transformational insights or self-realization in other Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}} Meditation in early Jain literature is a form of austerity and ascetic practice in Jainism, while in late medieval era the practice adopted ideas from other Indian traditions. According to Paul Dundas, this lack of meditative practices in early Jain texts may be because substantial portions of ancient Jain texts were lost.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}}

{{anchor|samayika}}According to [[Padmanabh Jaini]], ''[[Sāmāyika]]'' is a practice of "brief periods in meditation" in Jainism that is a part of ''siksavrata'' ("ritual restraint").{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–181}} The goal of ''Sāmāyika'' is to achieve equanimity, and it is the second ''siksavrata''.{{refn|group=note|The first is desavakasika (staying in a restrained surrounding, cutting down worldly activities). The third is ''posadhopavasa'' (fasting on the 8th and 14th days on lunar waxing and waning cycles). The fourth is ''dana'' (giving alms to Jain monks, nuns or spiritual people).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–181}}}} The ''samayika'' ritual is practiced at least three times a day by mendicants, while a layperson includes it with other ritual practices such as ''Puja'' in a Jain temple and doing charity work.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–182}}{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=261}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=128–131}} According to Johnson, as well as Jaini, ''samayika'' connotes more than meditation, and for a Jain householder is the voluntary ritual practice of "assuming temporary ascetic status".{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=189–190}}{{refn|group=note|According to Dundas, ''samayika'' seems to have meant "correct behavior" in early Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=170}}}}

The Digambara Jain scholar Kundakunda, in his ''Pravacanasara'' states that a Jain mendicant should meditate on "I, the pure self". Anyone who considers his body or possessions as "I am this, this is mine" is on the wrong road, while one who meditates, thinking the antithesis and "I am not others, they are not mine, I am one knowledge" is on the right road to meditating on the "soul, the pure self".{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=137–143}}{{refn|group=note|This meditative focus contrasts with the ''[[anatta]]'' focus of Buddhism, and the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' focus in various ''[[vedanta]]'' schools of Hinduism such as ''[[advaita]]'' and ''[[vishistadvaita]]'' schools.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993| pp=74, 102, Part I: 1–3, 10–11, 24, Part II: 20–28}}{{sfn|Mahony|1997|pp= 171-177, 222}}}}

===Rituals and worship===
{{Main|Jain rituals}}
[[File:Shravanbelgola Gomateshvara feet prayer1.jpg|thumb|Praying at the feet of a statue of [[Bahubali]]]]

There are many rituals in Jainism's various sects. According to Dundas, the ritualistic lay path among Śvētāmbara Jains is "heavily imbued with ascetic values", where the rituals either revere or celebrate the ascetic life of Tirthankaras, or mendicants, or progressively get closer to psychologically and physically living ever more like an ascetic.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=162-165, 295-296}} The ultimate ritual is ''sallekhana'', a religious death through ascetic abandonment of food and drinks.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}} The Digambara Jains follow the same theme, but the details differ from Śvētāmbaras, and according to Dundas, the life cycle and religious rituals are closer to the liturgy found among Hindu traditions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}} The overlap in Jain and Hindu rituals is largely in the life cycle (rites-of-passage) rituals, according to Padmanabh Jaini, and likely one that developed over time because Jains and Hindus societies overlapped, and rituals were viewed as necessary and secular ceremonies.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=291-299}}{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=186-187}}

Jains do not believe in a creator god, but do ritually worship numerous deities.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=162-165, 295-296}} The Jinas are prominent and a large focus of this ritualism, but they are not the only ''deva'' in Jainism. A Jina as ''deva'' is not an [[avatar]] (incarnation) in Jainism, but the highest state of omniscience that an ascetic ''tirthankara'' achieved.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=295-299}} Out of the 24 Tirthankaras, Jain devotional worship is predominantly addressed to four: Mahāvīra, [[Parshvanatha]], [[Neminatha]] and [[Rishabhanatha]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=40}} Among the non-''tirthankara'' saints, devotional worship is common for [[Bahubali]] among the Digambaras.{{sfn|Cort|2010|pp=182-184}} Some of Jaina rituals remember the five life events of the ''tirthankaras'', called the ''[[Panch Kalyanaka]]'', are rituals such as the ''[[Panch Kalyanaka Pratishtha Mahotsava]]'', ''Panch Kalyanaka Puja'' and ''Snatrapuja''.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=196, 343, 347}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=196–199}}

[[File:A Jain ritual offerings and puja recital at a temple, worship in Jainism.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Jain worship may include ritual offerings and recitals.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=45-46, 215}}]]
The basic worship ritual practised by Jains is ''darsana'' ("seeing") of ''deva'', which includes Jina,{{sfn|Lindsay Jones|2005|p=4771}} or other [[Yaksha|yaksas]], gods and goddesses such as Brahmadeva, 52 Viras, Padmavati, Ambika and 16 Vidyadevis (Sarasvati, Lakshmi, others).{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=33, 59, 92, 138, 191}}{{sfn|Cort|1987|pp=235–255}}{{sfn|Mishra|Ray|2016|pp=141–148}} The Terapanthi sub-tradition of Digambaras do not worship many of the deities popular among mainstream Digambaras, and they limit their ritual worship to Tirthankaras.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=365}} The worship ritual is called the ''devapuja'', is found in all Jaina sub traditions, which share common features.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=199–200}} Typically, the Jaina layperson enters the temple inner sanctum in simple clothing and bare feet, with a plate filled with offerings, bows down, says the [[namaskar]]a, completes his or her litany and prayers, sometimes is assisted by the temple priest, leaves the offerings and then departs.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=199–200}}

Jain practices include performing ''[[abhisheka]]'' ("ceremonial bath") of the images.{{sfn|Pal|1986|p=29}} Some Jain sects employ a ''pujari'' (also called ''upadhye'') for rituals, who may be a non-Jain (a Hindu), to perform special rituals and other priestly duties at the temple.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=204-205}}{{sfn|Salvadori|1989|pp=169–170}} More elaborate worship includes ritual offerings such as rice, fresh and dry fruits, flowers, coconut, sweets, and money. Some may light up a lamp with camphor and make auspicious marks with sandalwood paste. Devotees also recite Jain texts, particularly the life stories of the tirthankaras.{{sfn|Babb|1996|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=45-46, 215}}

The traditional Jains, like Buddhists and Hindus, believe in the efficacy of [[mantra]]s and that certain sounds and words are inherently auspicious, powerful and spiritual.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=81-82}}&lt;ref name="Nayanar 2005b, p.35 Gāthā 1.29"&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.{{nbsp}}35 Gāthā 1.29&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of the mantras, broadly accepted in various sects of Jainism, is the "five homage" (''[[Namokar Mantra|panca namaskara]]'') mantra which is believed to be eternal and existent since the first ford-maker's time.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=81-82}} The medieval era Jain worship practices, according to Ellen Gough, also developed tantric diagrams of the ''Rishi-mandala'' where the ''tirthankaras'' are portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Gough (2012), Shades of Enlightenment: A Jain Tantric Diagram and the Colours of the Tirthankaras, International Journal of Jaina Studies, Volume 8, Number 1, pages 1-47; [http://gsas.yale.edu/news/studying-jainism-and-its-tantric-ritual-diagrams-india Summary Archive: Studying Jainism and its Tantric Ritual Diagrams in India, Ellen Gough]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric traditions within Jainism use mantra and rituals that are believed to accrue merit for rebirth realms.{{sfn|Cort|2001b|pp=417–419}}

===Festivals===
{{Main|Jain festivals}}
[[File:Das Lakshana (Paryusana) celebrations, New York City Jain temple 2.JPG|thumb|Celebrating [[Das Lakshana]] (Paryusana), [[Jain Center of America]], New York City]]
Jains celebrate many annual festivals. Many of the major festivals in Jainism fall in and around the ''comasu'' (Sanskrit: ''chaturmasa'') period of the calendar. {{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=146-147}} It is the four month monsoon period when the Jain ascetics are mandated to remain in residence at one place in the Jain tradition, rather than be traveling or going around Indian villages and towns and never staying in one place for more than a month. The ''comasu'' period allows the four orders of the Jain community to be together and participate in the festive remembrances.

The most important annual Jain festival is called the ''Paryushana'' by Svetambaras and ''Dasa lakshana parva'' by the Digambaras. It is celebrated from the 12th day of waning moon in the traditional luni-solar month of [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadrapada]] in the [[Hindu calendar|Indian calendar]]. This typically falls in August or September of the Gregorian calendar.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}}{{sfn|Melton|2011|p=673}} It lasts eight days for Svetambaras, and ten days among the Digambaras.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}} It is a time when lay people fast and pray. The five vows are emphasized during this time.{{sfn|Melton|2011|p=673}} Svetambaras recite the ''Kalpasūtras'', while Digambaras read their own texts. The festival is an occasion where Jains make active effort to stop cruelty towards other life forms, freeing animals in captivity and preventing slaughter of animals.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}}

{{Quote box

}}
The last day involves a focused prayer/meditation session known as ''[[Samvatsari]]''. Jains consider this as a day of atonement, granting forgiveness to others, seeking forgiveness from all living beings, physically or mentally asking for forgiveness and resolving to treat everyone in the world as friends.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}} Forgiveness is asked by saying "''[[Micchami Dukkadam]]''" or "''Khamat Khamna''" to others. This means, "If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or action, then I seek your forgiveness." The literal meaning of ''Paryushana'' is "abiding" or "coming together".{{sfn|Cort|1995|p=160}}

[[Mahavir Jayanti]] celebrates the birth of Mahāvīra. It is celebrated on the 13th day of the luni-solar month of [[Chaitra]] in the traditional Indian calendar. This typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=220}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=211}} The festivities include visiting Jain temples, pilgrimages to shrines, reading Jain texts and processions of Mahāvīra by the community. At his legendary birthplace of Kundagrama in [[Bihar]], north of Patna, special events are held by Jains.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=220}}

[[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]] is observed by Jains as the anniversary of Mahāvīra's attainment of ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]''.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=86}} The Hindu festival of [[Diwali]] is also celebrated on the same date (''Kartika Amavasya''). Jain temples, homes, offices, and shops are decorated with lights and [[Diya (lamp)|''diyas'']] ("small oil lamps"). The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Sweets are often distributed. On Diwali morning, ''Nirvan Ladoo'' is offered after praying to Mahāvīra in all Jain temples across the world. The Jain new year starts right after Diwali.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=86}} Some other festivals celebrated by Jains are [[Akshaya Tritiya]] and [[Raksha Bandhan]], similar to those in the Hindu communities.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=85}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=164}}

Jainism monastic organization is a part of Jain society called ''sangh''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}} A ''sangh'' has a four-fold order, or ''caturvidh, sakal sangh''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}} This consists of ''sadhu'' (male ascetics, ''muni''), ''sadhvi'' (female ascetics, ''aryika''), ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvaka]]'' ("laymen"), and ''śrāvikā'' ("laywoman").{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2009|p=17}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=2–3}} The latter two support the ascetics and their monastic organizations called ''gacch'' or ''samuday'', in autonomous regional Jain congregations.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}}

Digambar tradition has two main monastic orders [[Mula Sangh]] and the [[Kashtha Sangh]], both led by [[Bhattaraka]]s. Other notable monastic orders include the [[Digambara Terapanth]] which emerged in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;John E.

According to Śvētāmbara Jain texts, from ''Kalpasūtras'' onwards, its monastic community has had more ''sadhvis'' than ''sadhus'' (female than male mendicants). In ''Tapa Gacch'' of the modern era, the ratio of ''sadhvis'' to ''sadhus'' (nuns to monks) is about 3.5 to 1.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=47}} In contrast to Śvētāmbara, the Digambara sect monastic community has been predominantly male.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=314–331, 353–361}} In the Digambara tradition, a male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve his soul's liberation from rebirths through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in the Digambara sect of Jainism.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}} The Śvētāmbaras disagree with the Digambaras, believing that women can also achieve liberation from ''[[Saṃsāra]]'' through ascetic practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=55–59}}

The Jain monastic organization shares many parallels with those found in Buddhist and Brahmanical-Hindu monasticism.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}}{{sfn|Caillat|2003a|pp=30-34 with footnote 28}} They all have similar rules, hierarchical structure, practices such as not traveling during the four-month monsoon season and celibacy.{{sfn|Caillat|2003a|pp=30-34 with footnote 28}} According to William Johnston, this is not likely from mutual borrowing of ideas, but because these traditions emerged from the same ancient Indian monastic traditions that preceded the Buddha and the Mahāvīra.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} There are some differences. For example, the Jain and Hindu monastic community has been traditionally more mobile and had an itinerant lifestyle, while Buddhist monks have favored belonging to a ''sangha'' (monastery) and staying in its premises.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1993|pp=4–7}} Buddhist monastic rules forbid a monk to go outside without wearing the sangha's distinctive ruddy robe, or to use wooden bowls.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} In contrast, Jain monastic rules have either required no clothes (Digambara) or white (Śvētāmbara) and the use of wooden or empty gourd as the begging bowl.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} The Jain monastic rules have encouraged the use of mouth cover, as well as a broom to gently remove any insect that comes in their path.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2013|p=197}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=152, 163–164}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=190}}

===Supplementary vows and ''Sallekhana''===
Jainism also prescribes seven supplementary vows which include three ''guņa vratas'' ("merit vows") and four ''śikşā vratas''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=87–88}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=5}}

The ''[[Sallekhana]]'' (or ''Santhara'') vow is a "religious death" ritual vow observed at the end of life, historically by Jain monks and nuns, but rare in the modern age.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179-180}} In this vow, there is voluntary and gradual reduction of food and liquid intake to end one's life by choice and with dispassion,{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=16}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=7}} In Jainism this is believed to reduce negative karma that affects a soul's future rebirths.{{sfn|Williams|1991|pp=166–167}}

The Jain community is divided into two major [[Religious denomination|denominations]], [[Digambara]] and [[Śvētāmbara]]. Monks of the Digambara ("sky-clad") tradition do not wear clothes. Female monastics of the Digambara sect wear unstitched plain white [[saree]]s and are referred to as ''[[Aryika]]s''. Śvētāmbara ("white-clad") monastics, on the other hand, wear seamless white clothes.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=45}}

During Chandragupta Maurya's reign, Jain tradition states that ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu predicted a twelve-year-long famine and moved to Karnataka with his disciples. [[Sthulabhadra]], a pupil of ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu, stayed in Magadha.{{sfn|Clarke|Beyer|2009|p=326}} Later, when followers of ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu returned, they found those who had remained at Magadha had started wearing white clothes, which was unacceptable to the others who remained naked.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=47}} This is how Jains believe the Digambara and Śvētāmbara schism began, with the former being naked while the latter wore white clothes.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=46}} Digambara saw this as being opposed to the Jain tenet of ''aparigraha'' which, according to them, required not even possession of clothes, i.e. complete nudity. In the 5th-century CE, the Council of Valabhi was organized by Śvētāmbara, which Digambara did not attend. At the council, the Śvētāmbara adopted the texts they had preserved as canonical scriptures, which Digambara have ever since rejected. This council solidified the historic schism between these two major traditions of Jainism.{{sfn|Price|2010|pp=104–105}}{{sfn|Fohr|2015|pp=21–22}} The earliest record of Digambara beliefs is contained in the Prakrit ''Suttapahuda'' of [[Kundakunda]].{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=3}}

Other than rejecting or accepting different ancient Jain texts, Digambaras and Śvētāmbara differ in other significant ways such as:
* Śvētāmbaras trace their practices and dress code to the teachings of Parshvanatha, the 23rd ''tirthankara'', which they believe taught only Four restraints (a claim, scholars say are confirmed by the ancient Buddhist texts that discuss Jaina monastic life). Mahāvīra taught Five vows, which Digambara follow.{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=211}}{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=5}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=31–33}} The Digambara sect disagrees with the Śvētāmbara interpretations,{{sfn|Jaini|2000|pp=27–28}} and reject the theory of difference in Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra's teachings.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=5}}
* Digambaras believe that both Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra remained unmarried, whereas Śvētāmbara believe the 23rd and 24th did indeed marry. According to the Śvētāmbara version, Parshva married Prabhavati,{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=12}} and Mahāvīra married Yashoda who bore him a daughter named Priyadarshana.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=73–74}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}} The two sects also differ on the origin of [[Trishala]], Mahāvīra's mother,{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=73–74}} as well as the details of Tirthankara's biographies such as how many auspicious dreams their mothers had when they were in the wombs.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=17}}
* Digambara believe Rishabha, [[Vasupujya]] and [[Neminatha]] were the three ''tirthankaras'' who reached omniscience while in sitting posture and other ''tirthankaras'' were in standing ascetic posture. In contrast, Śvētāmbaras believe it was Rishabha, Nemi and Mahāvīra who were the three in sitting posture.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|pp=79-80}}
* Digambara monasticism rules are more rigid.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=167}}
* Digambara [[iconography]] are plain, Śvētāmbara icons are decorated and colored to be more lifelike.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=167}}

Excavations at Mathura revealed Jain statues from the time of the [[Kushan Empire]] (c.{{nbsp}}1st century CE). ''Tirthankara'' represented without clothes, and monks with cloth wrapped around the left arm, are identified as the ''Ardhaphalaka'' ("half-clothed") mentioned in texts. The [[Yapaniya]]s, believed to have originated from the ''Ardhaphalaka'', followed Digambara nudity along with several Śvētāmbara beliefs.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=167}}

===Other sub-traditions===
Both of the major Jain traditions evolved into sub-traditions over time. For example, the devotional worship traditions of Śvētāmbara are referred to as ''[[Murtipujaka|Murti-pujakas]]'', those who live in and around Jain temples became ''Deravasi'' or ''Mandira-margi''. Those who avoid temples and pursue their spirituality at a designated monastic meeting place came to be known as ''[[Sthānakavāsī]]''.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=341}}&lt;ref name=sthanakavasibrit&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sthanakavasi Sthanakavasi], JAIN SECT, Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; About the 18th century, the Śvētāmbara and Digambara traditions saw an emergence of separate Terapanthi movements.&lt;ref name=sthanakavasibrit/&gt;{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=41, 60}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=155-157, 249-250, 254-259}} Some scholars such as Malvaniya state that these ideas entered Jainism from an influence of Islam, while others such as Dundas state that these ideas, debates and movements can be traced in more ancient texts than the start of Islam.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=249}}

In the modern era, according to Flügel, new Jaina religious movements that are a "primarily devotional form of Jainism" have developed which resemble "Jain Mahayana" style devotionalism.{{sfn|Flügel|2005|pp=194–243}}

===Gender and spiritual liberation===
A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. In the Digambara traditional belief, women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}} However, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Śvētāmbara sect that believes that women too can achieve spiritual liberation from rebirths in ''Saṃsāra''.{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp= 55–59}} The ''Śvētāmbaras'' state the 19th ''Tirthankara'' [[Māllīnātha]] was female.{{sfn|Vallely|2002|p=15}}  However, Digambara reject this, and worship Mallinatha as a male.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=56}}

===''Dravya'' ("Substance")===
{{Main|Dravya}}
[[File:Dravya.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.15|Chart showing the classification of ''dravya'' and ''astikaya'']]
The ''dravya'' in Jainism are fundamental entities, called ''astikaya'' (literally, "collection that exists").{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} They are believed to be eternal, and the [[ontology|ontological]] building blocks that constitute and explain all existence, whether perceived or not.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81–89}}

According to the Śvētāmbara tradition of Jainism, there are five eternal substances in existence: Soul (''jiva''), Matter (''pudgala''), Space (''akasha''), motion (''Dharma'') and rest (''Adharma'').&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The ontological categories and definition of ''dharma'' as motion, and ''adharma'' as rest, is unique to Jainism among Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=95}} However, like other Indian religions, ''dharma'' also means "moral virtue" in Jainism, while ''adharma'' also means "immorality, unethical behavior".&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;}} To this list of five, the Digambara Jain tradition adds "Time" (''kala'') as the sixth eternal substance.&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} In both traditions, the substance of space is conceptualized as "world space" (''lokakasha'') and "non-world space" (''alokiakasha''). Further, both soul and matter are considered as active ontological substances, while the rest are inactive.&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt; Another categorization found in Jain philosophy is ''jiva'' and ''ajiva'', the latter being all ''dravya'' that is not ''jiva''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81–89}}

====''Jīva'' ("Soul"), ''Ajīva'' ("Non-Soul")====
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)| Ajiva}}

''Jiva'' means "soul" in Jainism, and is also called ''jivatman''.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}} It is a core concept and the fundamental focus of the Jain theology.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=97–101}} The soul is believed to be eternal, and a substance that undergoes constant modifications, in every life, after every rebirth of a living being.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} ''Jiva'' consists of pure consciousness in the Jain thought, has innate "free will" that causes it to act but is believed to be intangible and formless.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} It is the soul that experiences existence and gains knowledge, not mind nor body both believed to a heap of matter.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}}{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|pp=15-16}} Jain philosophy further believes that the soul is the mechanism of rebirth, and karma accumulation. It is the same size in all living beings, such as a human being, a tiny insect and a large elephant. ''Jiva'' is everywhere, filling and infused in every minuscule part of the entire ''loka'' (realm of existence), according to Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}} The soul has the potential to reach omniscience and eternal bliss, and end the cycles of rebirth and associated suffering, which is the goal of Jain spirituality.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=97–106}}

The ''jiva'' is believed to rely on other ''dravya'' to function.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} The Jain philosophy completely separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness).&lt;ref name=britdravyajain&gt;{{citation |title=Dravya – Jainism |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Souls reside in bodies and journey endlessly through ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'' (that is, realms of existence through cycles of rebirths and redeaths).{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=91}}

''Jivas'' are believed to be of two types, stationary and mobile. Illustration of the former are plants, while moving ''jivas'' include examples such as human beings, animals, gods, hell beings and insects.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}} ''Jivas'' are further classified in Jain philosophy by assigned number of senses which range from one sensory organ to five sensory organs.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}} Inert world such as air, fire or clod of dirt, considered non-sensate in contemporary science, are asserted in historic texts of Jainism to be living and with sensory powers.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (2001), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027724 The Living Cosmos of Jainism: A Traditional Science Grounded in Environmental Ethics], ''Daedalus'', MIT Press, Vol. 130, No. 4, pages 207-224&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ajiva'' consists of everything other than ''jiva''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-96}} Life processes such as breath, means of knowledge such as language, all emotional and biological experiences such as pleasure and pain are all believed in Jainism to be made of ''pudgala'' ("matter"). These interact with ''tattva'' or reality to create, bind, destroy or unbind karma particles to the soul.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96-98}}{{sfn|Soni|1991|pp=75–88}}

According to Dundas, ''Dharma'' as a metaphysical substance in Jain philosophy may be understood as "that which carries" instead of the literal sense of ordinary physical motion. Thus, ''dharma'' includes all verbal and mental activity, that contribute to karma and purification of the soul.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}}

===''Tattva'' ("Reality")===
{{Main|Tattva (Jainism)}}
[[File:Tattva.jpg|thumb|The 7 [[Tattva (Jainism)|Tattvas]] of Jain philosophy]]
''Tattva'' connotes "Reality, Truth" in Jain philosophy, and is the framework for salvation. According to Digambara Jains, there are seven ''tattvas'', while Śvētāmbaras believe in nine ''tattvas'':{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=177-187}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96-98}}
* The sentient (''jiva'', soul)
* The insentient (''ajiva'')
* The karmic influx (''[[Asrava|Āsrava]]'') to the soul
* Good karma (''punya'', merits), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
* Bad karma (''papa'', negatives), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
* The bondage (''[[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]]'') of karmic particles to the soul, thereby causing its change, which cumulatively determines the future rebirths{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=188-190}}{{sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=219–228}}
* The stoppage (''[[Saṃvara]]'') of karmic influx
* The dissociation and wiping away of past karmic particles (''[[Nirjara|Nirjarā]]'') from the soul
* The liberation (''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'')

The true insight in Jain philosophy is considered as "faith in the ''tattvas''".{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}} The spiritual goal in Jainism is to reach ''[[moksha]]'' for ascetics, but for most Jain laypersons and ascetics it is to accumulate good karma that leads to better rebirth and a step closer to liberation.{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=108}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=18, 98-100}}

===Soul and Karma===
{{Main|Karma in Jainism}}
According to Jainism, the existence of "a bound and ever changing soul" is a self-evident truth, an axiom which does not need to be proven.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=103}} There are numerous souls, but every one of them has three qualities (''[[Guṇa]]''): consciousness (''caitanya'', most important quality of soul), bliss (''sukha'') and vibrational energy (''virya'').{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=104-106}} The vibration draws karmic particles to the soul and creates bondages, but is also what adds merit or demerit to the soul.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=104-106}}

Karma, like in other Indian religions, connotes in Jainism the universal cause and effect law. However, it is envisioned as a material substance (subtle matter) that can bind to the soul, travel with the soul substance in bound form between rebirths, and affect the suffering and happiness experienced by the ''jiva'' in the ''lokas''.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=92-95}} Karma is also believed to obscure and obstruct the innate nature and striving of the soul, as well as its spiritual potential in the next rebirth.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=99-103}}

The relationship between the soul and karma, states Padmanabh Jaini, can be explained with the analogy of gold. Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold. One can exert effort and purify gold, similarly, Jainism states that the defiled soul can be purified by proper refining methodology.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=107}} Karma either defiles the soul further, or refines it to a cleaner state, and this affects future rebirths.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=107-115}} Karma is thus an [[efficient cause]] (''nimitta'') in Jain philosophy, but not the [[material cause]] (''upadana''). The soul is believed to be the material cause.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=117-118}}

''Tirthankara-nama-karma'' is a special type of karma, bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=48}}

[[File:Jiva.jpg|thumb|left|Classification of ''Saṃsāri Jīvas'' (transmigrating souls) in Jainism]]
Jain texts state that souls exist as "clothed with material bodies", where it entirely fills up the body.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=194}} There are five types of bodies in the Jaina thought: earthly (e.g. most humans, animals and plants), metamorphic (e.g. gods, hell beings, fine matter, some animals and a few humans who can morph because of their perfections), transference type (e.g. good and pure substances realized by ascetics), fiery (e.g. heat that transforms or digests food), and karmic (the substrate where the karmic particles reside and which make the soul ever changing).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=195-196}}

Jain philosophy further divides the earthly body by symmetry, number of sensory organs, vitalities (''ayus''), functional capabilities and whether one body hosts one soul or one body hosts many.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=195-198}} Every living being has one to five senses, three ''balas'' (power of body, language and mind), respiration (inhalation and exhalation), and life-duration.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=198-201}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=34}} All living beings, in every realm including the gods and hell beings, accrue and destroy eight types of karma according to the elaborate theories in Jain texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=185-194}} Elaborate descriptions of the shape and function of the physical and metaphysical universe, and its constituents, are also provided in the [[Jain texts]].&lt;ref&gt;Shah, R. S. "JAINA MATHEMATICS: LORE OF LARGE NUMBERS." Bulletin of the Marathwada Mathematical Society 10.1 (2009): 43–61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=241}} All of these elaborate theories attempt to illustrate and consistently explain the Jain karma theory in a deeply moral framework, much like Buddhism and Hinduism but with significant differences in the details and assumptions.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=180-182}}

===Saṃsāra===
{{main|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|right|thumb|[[Soul]]s are reborn in various realms of existence depending on their [[karma]]s, according to Jainism.]]
The conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (''jiva'') is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions. It is not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=226}} The Jaina theosophy, unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=228}}{{sfn|Jaini|2000|pp=130–131}} As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=223-224}} With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=224-225}}{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=30-31}}

Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=227}} Some evolve to a higher state; some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=227-228}} Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' ("incapable"), or a class of souls that can never attain ''[[moksha]]'' ("liberation").{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=104-105}} The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=225}} Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-samsara cycle, and does not subscribe to ''[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]]''-style ("not two") [[nondualism]] of Hinduism, or ''[[Madhyamaka|Advaya]]''-style nondualism of Buddhism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=104-105}} A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond ''Saṃsāra'', is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''Siddha''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}}

===Cosmology===
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}

[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|left|Rebirth ''loka'' (realms of existence) in Jain cosmology.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90-92}}]]

Jain texts propound that the universe consists of many eternal ''lokas'' ("realms of existence"). As in Buddhism and Hinduism, Jain cosmology believes both time and the universe are eternal without beginning and end, and that the universe is transient (impermanent in attributes) at the same time.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=241}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}} The universe, body, matter and time are considered in Jain philosophy as separate from the soul (''jiva'' or ''jivatman''). Their interaction explains life, living, death and rebirth.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}}

[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Division of time in Jain cosmology.]]
According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into three parts, the upper, middle, and lower worlds, called respectively ''urdhva loka'', ''madhya loka'', and ''adho loka''.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=25}} As with the realms of existences, ''Kāla'' ("time") is without beginning and eternal;{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} the cosmic wheel of time, called ''kālachakra'', rotates ceaselessly. According to Jain texts, in this part of the universe, there are six periods of time within two aeons (''ara''), and in the first aeon the universe generates, and in the next it degenerates.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=46}} Thus, the worldly cycle of time is divided into two parts or half-cycles, ''utsarpiṇī'' ("ascending") and ''[[avasarpiṇī]]'' ("descending").{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} ''Utsarpiṇī'' is a period of progressive prosperity, where happiness increases, while ''avasarpiṇī'' is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=313}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=271–272}} According to Jain cosmology, it is currently the fifth ''ara'' of ''avasarpiṇī'' (half time cycle of degeneration). The present age is one of sorrow and misery, of religious decline, where the height and shape of living beings shrink. Jain thought holds that after the sixth ''ara'', the universe will be reawakened in the new cycle and the start of ''utsarpiṇī'' ''aras''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=13}}{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=124}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=27}}

According to Jain texts, sixty-three illustrious beings, called ''[[śalākāpuruṣa]]s'', are born on this earth in every ''Dukhama-sukhamā'' ''ara''.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135}} The Jain universal history is a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious persons.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=12}} They comprise twenty-four ''Tīrthaṅkaras'', twelve ''[[chakravartin]]s'', nine ''[[balabhadra]]'', nine ''narayana'', and nine ''pratinarayana''.{{sfn|Joseph|1997|p=178}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135, 285}}{{refn|group=note|Balabhadra is also referred to as Baladeva, Narayana as Vasudeva or Vishnu, and Pratinarayana as Prativasudeva in Jain texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135, 285}}}}

A ''chakravartī'' is an emperor of the world and lord of the material realm.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135}} Though he possesses worldly power, he often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the vastness of the cosmos. Jain ''[[purana]]s'' give a list of twelve ''chakravartins'' ("universal monarchs"). They are golden in complexion.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=72}} One of the ''chakravartins'' mentioned in Jain scriptures is [[Bharata Chakravartin]]. Jain texts like ''[[Harivamsa Purana]]'' and Hindu Texts like ''Vishnu Purana'' state that Indian subcontinent came to be known as ''Bharata varsha'' in his memory.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=106}}{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=5}}

There are nine sets of ''balabhadra'', ''narayana'', and ''pratinarayana''. The ''balabhadra'' and ''narayana'' are brothers.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=377}} ''Balabhadra'' are nonviolent heroes, ''narayana'' are violent heroes, and ''pratinarayana'' the villains. According to the legends, the ''narayana'' ultimately kill the ''pratinarayana''. Of the nine ''balabhadra'', eight attain liberation and the last goes to heaven. On death, the ''narayana'' go to hell because of their violent exploits, even if these were intended to uphold righteousness.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|pp=73–76}}

[[Jain cosmology]] divides the worldly cycle of time into two parts (''avasarpiṇī'' and ''utsarpiṇī''). According to Jain belief, in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four ''tīrthaṅkaras'' are born in the human realm to discover and teach the Jain doctrine appropriate for that era.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2015|p=175}}{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Lindsay Jones|2005|p=4764}} The word ''tīrthankara'' signifies the founder of a ''[[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]'', which means a fordable passage across a sea.

{{Main|God in Jainism}}
{{See also|Pañca-Parameṣṭhi}}
According to Jainism, the universe was never created, nor will it ever cease to exist. It is independent and self-sufficient, does not require a creator nor any superior power to govern it, nor a judge nor destroyer.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=241-242}} In this belief, it is distinct from the monotheistic Abrahamic religions; it is similar to Buddhism. It shares premises with the non-theistic part of the spectrum of diverse beliefs found in different traditions within Hindu philosophy and distinct from theistic Hindu traditions.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=241-243}}

Jain texts reject the idea of a creator, ruler or destroyer god and postulate an [[Jainism and non-creationism|eternal universe]]. However, Jainism believes in the world of gods and hell beings who are born, and who die to be reborn like living beings in the earthly realm of existence.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=247-249, 262-263}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=20-21, 34-35, 74, 91, 95-96, 103}} Those souls who live in the body of a god do so because of their positive karma. They have a metamorphic body, that is they are believed in Jain thought to be able to change their body at will. The gods live a life of happiness, fun and frolic, whose wishes are automatically fulfilled.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}} They also possess a more transcendent knowledge about material things and can anticipate events in the human realms.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}} However, once their past karmic merit is exhausted, the souls leave the "god body" and are reborn again as humans, animals or other beings.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=91, 95-96}}

===Epistemology===
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
Jain philosophy accepts three reliable means of knowledge (''[[pramana]]''). It holds that correct knowledge is based on perception (''pratyaksa''), inference (''anumana'') and testimony (''sabda'' or the word of scriptures).&lt;ref&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jsoni367&gt;Jayandra Soni (2000), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400179 Basic Jaina Epistemology], Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press, Vol. 50, No. 3, pages 367-377&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are elaborated in Jain texts such as ''Tattvarthasūtra'', ''Parvacanasara'', ''Nandi'' and ''Anuyogadvarini''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=75-76, 131, 229-230}}&lt;ref name=jsoni367/&gt; Some Jain texts add analogy (''upamana'') as the fourth reliable means, in a manner similar to [[pramana|epistemological theories]] found in other Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-230}}

In Jainism, ''jnāna'' ("knowledge") is said to be of five kinds—''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' ("Omniscience"), ''Śrutu Jñāna'' ("Scriptural Knowledge"), ''Mati Jñāna'' ("Sensory Knowledge"), ''Avadhi Jñāna'' ("Clairvoyance"), and ''Manah prayāya Jñāna'' ("Telepathy").{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=16}} According to the Jain text ''Tattvartha sūtra'', the first two are indirect knowledge and the remaining three are direct knowledge.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=6}}

===Salvation, liberation===
{{Main|Moksha (Jainism)||Ratnatraya|Gunasthana}}
[[File:MahaveeJi.jpg|thumb|The three [[Shikhara|shikhar]] (top) of a [[Jain temple]] represents ''Ratnatraya'' (three jewels)]]

According to Jainism, purification of soul and liberation can be achieved through the path of three jewels:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=6}}{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=6-7}}{{sfn|Fohr|2015|pp=9–10, 37}}
# ''Samyak darśana'' ("Correct View") {{nsndns}} Faith in basic tenets of Jainism, acceptance of the self-evident truth of soul (''jīva''){{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=141-147}}
# ''Samyak jnana'' ("Correct Knowledge") {{nsndns}} Knowledge of the ''tattvas'' without any doubt or misapprehension{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=148, 200}}
# ''Samyak charitra'' (Correct Conduct) {{nsndns}} behavior consistent with the Five vows{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=148, 200}}

Jain texts often add ''samyak tap'' (Correct Asceticism) as the fourth jewel, thereby emphasizing their belief in ascetic practices as the means to liberation ([[moksha]]).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=7}} The four jewels of orthodox Jain ideology are called ''moksha marg''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=6-7}} According to Jain texts, the liberated pure soul (''Siddha'') goes up to the summit of universe (''[[Siddhashila]]'') and dwells there in eternal bliss.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=282–283}}

==Scriptures and texts==
{{Main|Jain literature|Jain Agamas}}
[[File:Suryaprajnapati Sutra.jpg|thumb|The Suryaprajnaptisūtra, a 4th or 3rd century BCE astronomy text of Śvētāmbara Jains.

[[File:Jain Agamas.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.85|Stela depicting ''Śhrut Jnāna'', or complete scriptural knowledge]]

Jain scriptures are called ''Agamas''. They are believed to have been verbally transmitted by the [[oral tradition]] from one generation to the next, much like the ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-61}} The Jain tradition believes that their religion is eternal, and the teachings of their first ''Tirthankara Rishabhanatha'' were their scriptures millions of years ago.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp= 109–110}} The mythology states that the ''tirthankara'' taught in a divine preaching hall called ''[[samavasarana]]'', which were heard by the gods, the ascetics and laypersons. The discourse delivered is called ''Śhrut Jnāna'' and comprises eleven ''[[Jain Agamas#Angas|angas]]'' and fourteen ''[[purvas]]''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=135}} The discourse is remembered and transmitted by the ''[[Ganadhara]]s'' ("chief disciples"), and is composed of twelve ''angas'' ("departments"). It is symbolically represented by a tree with twelve branches.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=136}}

According to the Jain tradition, an ''araha'' ("worthy one") speaks meaning that is then converted into ''sūtra'' (''sutta'') by his disciples, and from such ''sūtras'' emerge the doctrine.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}} The creation and transmission of the ''Agama'' is the work of disciples in Jainism. These texts, historically for Jains, have represented the truths uttered by their ''tirthankaras'', particularly the Mahāvīra.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}} In every cycle of Jain cosmology, twenty-four ''tirthankaras'' appear and so do the Jain scriptures for that ''ara''.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=109–110}} The spoken scriptural language is believed to be ''[[Magadhi Prakrit|Ardhamagadhi]]'' by the Śvētāmbara Jains, and a form of sonic resonance by the Digambara Jains. These then become coded into ''duvala samgagani pidaga'' (twelve limbed baskets by disciples), but transmitted orally.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-61}} In the 980th year after Mahāvīra's death (~5th century CE), the texts were written down for the first time by the Council of Valabhi.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=110–111}}

The Śvētāmbaras believe that they have the original Jain scriptures. The Śvētāmbara belief is denied by the Digambaras, who instead believe the scriptures were lost.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=121-122}} The Śvētāmbaras state that their collection of 45 works represent a continuous tradition, though they accept that their collection is also incomplete because of a lost Anga text and four lost Purva texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=112-113}} The Digambara sect of Jainism believes that Āchārya [[Bhutabali]] was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. According to them, Digambara ''Āchāryas'' recreated the oldest-known Digambara Jain texts, including the four ''anuyoga''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2016|p=xii}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=78-81}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=124}} According to von Glasenapp, the Digambara texts partially agree with the enumerations and works of older Śvētāmbara texts, but in many cases there are also gross differences between the texts of the two major Jain traditions.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=121-122}}

The Śvētāmbara consider their 45 text collection as canonical.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=112-113}} The Digambaras created a secondary canon between 600 and 900 CE, compiling it into four groups: history, cosmography, philosophy and ethics.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=123-124}} This four-set collection is called the "four ''Vedas''" by the Digambaras.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=123-124}}{{refn|group=note|Not to be confused with the four ''[[Veda]]s'' of Hinduism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164-165}}}}

The most popular and influential texts of Jainism have been its non-canonical literature. Of these, the ''[[Kalpa Sūtra]]s'' are particularly popular among Śvētāmbaras, which they attribute to Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE). This ancient scholar is revered in the Digambara tradition, and they believe he led their migration into the ancient south Karnataka region, and created their tradition.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=125-126}} Śvētāmbaras disagree, and they believe that Bhadrabahu moved to Nepal, not into peninsular India.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=125-126}} Both traditions, however, consider his ''Niryuktis'' and ''Samhitas'' as important texts. The earliest surviving Sanskrit text by [[Umaswati]] called the ''[[Tattvarthasūtra]]'' is considered authoritative Jain philosophy text by all traditions of Jainism. {{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=439–440}}{{Sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=xi–xiii, Quote: "That Which Is, known as the ''Tattvartha Sūtra'' to Jains, is recognized by all four Jain traditions as the earliest, most authoritative and comprehensive summary of their religion."}}{{sfn|Dundas|2006|pp=395–396}} His text has the same importance in Jainism as ''[[Vedanta Sūtras]]'' and ''[[Yogasūtras]]'' have in [[Hinduism]].{{Sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=xiii}}{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=439–440}}{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=46–51, 91–96}}

In the Digambara tradition, the texts written by Kundakunda are highly revered and have been historically influential.{{sfn|Finegan|1989|p=221}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2003|pp=25-34}}{{sfn|Chatterjee|2000|p=282–283}} Other important Jain texts include: ''[[Samayasara]]'', ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]'', and ''[[Niyamasara]]''.{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=32–33}}

===Influence on Indian literature===
[[File:Mangulam inscription.jpg|thumb|[[Mangulam]] inscription dated 2nd century BCE]]
Parts of the [[Sangam literature]] in Tamil are attributed to Jaina authors. The authenticity and interpolations are controversial, because the Sangam literature presents Hindu ideas.{{sfn|Cush|Robinson|York|2012|pp=515, 839}} Some scholars state that the Jain portions of the Sangam literature were added about or after the 8th-century CE, and they are not the ancient layer.{{sfn|Zvelebil|1992|pp=13–16}}

Tamil Jain texts such as the ''[[Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi]]'' and ''[[Nālaṭiyār]]'' are credited to Digambara Jain authors.{{sfn|Cort|1998|p=163}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}} These texts have seen interpolations and revisions. For example, it is generally accepted now that the Jain nun Kanti inserted a 445-verse poem into ''Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi'' in the 12th century.{{sfn|Zvelebil|1992|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Spuler|1952|pp=24–25, context: 22-27}} The Tamil Jain literature, according to Dundas, has been "lovingly studied and commented upon for centuries by Hindus as well as Jains".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}} The themes of two of the Tamil epics, including the ''Silapadikkaram'', have an embedded influence of Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}}

Jain scholars also contributed to [[Kannada literature]].{{sfn|Cort|1998|p=164}} The Digambara Jain texts in Karnataka are unusual, in that they were written under the patronage of kings and regional aristocrats. These Jain texts describe warrior violence and martial valor as equivalent to a "fully committed Jain ascetic". They thus set aside the religious premise of absolute non-violence, possibly reflecting an effort to syncretise various doctrines and beliefs found in Hinduism and Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=118-120}}

Jain manuscript libraries, called ''bhandaras'' inside Jain temples, are the oldest surviving in India.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=83}} Jain libraries, including the Śvētāmbara collections at [[Patan, Gujarat]] and [[Jaisalmer|Jaiselmer, Rajasthan]], as well as the Digambara collections in Karnataka temples, have a large number of well-preserved manuscripts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=83}}&lt;ref name="metmu"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jaim/hd_jaim.htm | title=Jain Manuscript Painting | publisher=Heilburnn Timeline of Art History | work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=January 2012 |last=Guy| first= John }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts in the Jain libraries include Jaina literature, as well as Hindu and Buddhist texts. Almost all their texts have been dated to about, or after, the 11th century CE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=83–84}} The largest and most valuable libraries are found in the [[Thar Desert]], hidden in the underground vaults of Jain temples. These collections have witnessed insect damage, and only a small portion of these manuscripts have been published and studied by scholars.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=83–84}}

==Comparison with Buddhism and Hinduism==
{{main|Buddhism and Jainism|Jainism and Hinduism}}
Jainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. All of them believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates, amongst other things, the premise of ''[[anatta]]'' ("non-self", "no eternal self or soul"). Hinduism incorporates the premise of an eternal unchanging ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' ("self", "soul"), while Jainism incorporates the premises of a ''jiva'' ("self", "soul") that is both eternal and changing.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87-88}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2-5}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} In Jaina thought, there are infinite eternal ''jivas'', predominantly all of which are in their cycles of rebirth, and a few who have liberated themselves through an ascetic life and become ''siddhas'' ("a perfect one").{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=157–158, 168-169}} In contrast to Jainism, Hindu philosophies express a spectrum of views, ranging from [[advaita|nondualism]] where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one, to [[dvaita|dualism]] where souls are same and have Brahman-nature but are different from Brahman, and to other ideas.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=54–62, 77-82, 132}}{{sfn|Perrett|2013|pp=247–248}}{{sfn|Bartley|2013|pp=1-10, 76-79, 87-98}} Further, in Hindu thought, Jainism-style asceticism is not emphasized, rather liberation is achievable through alternate paths such as [[Jnana yoga]], [[Karma yoga]] and [[Bhakti yoga]].{{sfn|Raju|1985|pp=7–8}}{{sfn|Fowler|2012|pp=89–93}}{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007|pp=119–120}}

While both Hinduism and Jainism believe "soul exists" to be a self-evident truth, most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and the constant (''[[vibhu]]'') but some Hindu scholars proposed soul to be atomic. The Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and [[Brahman]] through a monistic or dualistic framework. In contrast, the Jaina thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=58, 102-105}}

Some early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the caste system in Hinduism.{{sfn|Nesfield|1885|pp=116–117}}{{sfn|Pope|1880|pp=40–41}} Later scholars, such as Gombrich state that this notion is an error for which "mainly Western authors are responsible".{{sfn|Alberts|2007|pp=258–259}} A caste system has been a historic part of Jain society.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=147-149, 304 footnote 24}}{{sfn|Babb|1996|pp=137–145, 54, 172}} According to Vilas Adinath Sangave, "caste system is a universal feature of the Jaina community", and the focus of Jainism has been the spiritual liberation of the individual rather than social reforms.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|pp=73, 316-317}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Richard Gombrich]] and other scholars, Buddhism too was not a rejection or rebellion against any ancient caste system and it too was focused on individual's liberation from rebirths and suffering. The caste system in Buddhist societies and monasteries outside India have been documented. Gombrich states, "Some modernists go so far as to say that the Buddha was against caste altogether: this is not the case, but is one of the mistakes picked up from western authors."{{sfn|Gombrich|2012|pp=344–353 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Alberts|2007|pp=258–259}}{{sfn|Florida|2005|pp=134–137}}}} According to Padamnath Jaini, the 8th-century Digambara scholar [[Jinasena]] stated that Jain king Bharata, the son of first ''tirthankara'' named [[Rishabhanatha]], invented the caste system by performing the ''ahiṃsā'' (non-violence) test, with Jain [[Brahmin]]s being those who followed the non-violence precept.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=288-289, 78}}

All three religions share concepts and doctrines such as karma and rebirth, and have similar ritual festival grammar, mythologies and monastic traditions.{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=11–22}}{{sfn|Appleton|2016|pp=1–21, 25–27, 57–58, 82–84}}{{sfn|McFaul|2006|pp=27–28}} They do not believe in eternal heaven or hell or judgment day. Jainism, like Buddhism and Hinduism, grants the freedom to choose beliefs such as in gods or no-gods, agree or disagree with core teachings, participate or not participate in prayers, rituals and festivals. They all consider ethical values such as non-violence to be important,{{sfn|Shaw|Demy|2017|p=635|quote=Ahiṃsā (to do no harm) is a significant aspect of three major religions: Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism}} and link suffering to craving, individual's actions, intents and karma, and believe spirituality is a means to enlightened peace, bliss and eternal liberation (''moksha'').{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18–22}}{{sfn|McFaul|2006|pp=27–40}}

Jainism is similar to Buddhism in [[epistemology|epistemically]] rejecting the Vedas and the Hindu metaphysical concept for Reality called Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe "soul exists" as a self-evident truth, and in their historic theology and practice have been more similar than with Buddhism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010b|pp=174–175}}{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18–22}} Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried over their history, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Kelting|2009|pp=206 note 4}}

==Art and architecture==

Jainism has contributed significantly to Indian art and architecture. Jain arts depict life legends of ''tirthankara'' or other important people, particularly with them in a seated or standing meditative posture. ''[[Yaksha]]s'' and ''[[yakshini]]s'', attendant spirits who guard the ''tirthankara'', are usually shown with them.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=184}} The earliest known Jain image is in the [[Patna]] museum.

''Ayagapata'' is a type of [[votive]] tablet used in Jainism for donation and worship in the early centuries. These tablets are decorated with objects and designs central to Jain worship such as the ''[[stupa]]'', ''[[dharmacakra]]'' and ''[[triratna]]''. They present simultaneous trends or image and symbol worship. Numerous such stone tablets were discovered during excavations at ancient Jain sites like [[Kankali Tila]] near [[Mathura]] in Uttar Pradesh, India. The practice of donating these tablets is documented from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishore|first=Kanika|date=2015-06-16|title=Symbol and Image Worship in Jainism|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0376983615569814|journal=Indian Historical Review|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=17–43|doi=10.1177/0376983615569814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayagapata|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46406/ayagapata|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jain|Fischer|1978|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Samavasarana]]'', a preaching hall of ''tirthankaras'' with various beings concentrically placed, is an important theme of Jain art.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=184}}

The [[Kirti Stambh|Jain tower in Chittor]], Rajasthan, is a good example of Jain architecture.{{sfn|Owen|2012|pp=1–2}} Decorated manuscripts are preserved in Jain libraries, containing diagrams from Jain cosmology.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=183}} Most of the paintings and illustrations depict historical events, known as ''Panch Kalyanaka'', from the life of the ''tirthankara''. Rishabha, the first ''tirthankara'', is usually depicted in either the [[lotus position]] or ''kayotsarga'', the standing position. He is distinguished from other ''tirthankara'' by the long locks of hair falling to his shoulders. Bull images also appear in his sculptures.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=113}} In paintings, incidents from his life, like his marriage and [[Indra]] marking his forehead, are depicted. Other paintings show him presenting a pottery bowl to his followers; he is also seen painting a house, weaving, and being visited by his mother Marudevi.{{sfn|Jain|Fischer|1978|p=16}} Each of the twenty-four ''tirthankara'' is associated with distinctive emblems, which are listed in such texts as ''Tiloyapannati'', ''Kahavaali'' and ''Pravacanasaarodhara''.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=187}}

A Jain temple, ''Derasar'' or ''Basadi'' is a [[place of worship]] for [[Jains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kamat.com/glossary/?whoID=234 |title=Basadi |work=kamat.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain temples are built with various architectural designs,{{sfn|Singhvi|Chopra|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} but there are mainly two type of Jain temples:
# [[Shikhara|Shikar]]-''bandhi'' Jain temple (one with a dome)
# ''Ghar'' Jain temple ([[Jain house temple]] – one without a dome).

There is always a main deity also known as ''moolnayak'' in every Jain temple placed inside a sanctum called ''[[Garbhagriha|"Gambhara"]]'' (Garbha Griha). A ''[[manastambha]]'' ("column of honor") is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples.

There are 26 caves, 200 stone beds, 60 inscriptions, and over 100 sculptures in and around [[Madurai]]. This is also the site where Jain ascetics wrote great epics and books on grammar in Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=S. S.

The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves dating back to the 2nd–1st century BCE are dedicated to Jainism. They are rich with carvings of Jain ''tirthanakars'' and deities with inscriptions including the [[Hathigumpha inscription|''Hathigumpha'' inscription]] ("Elephant Cave" inscription).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.proel.org/index.php?pagina=alfabetos/dravidi |title=Source |work=proel.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=460}} Jain cave temples at [[Badami cave temples|Badami]], [[Mangi-Tungi]] and the Ellora Caves are considered important.{{sfn|Owen|2012|p=50}}

The [[Sittanavasal Cave]] temple is regarded as one of the finest examples of Jain art. It is the oldest and most famous Jain centre in the region. It possesses both an early Jain cave shelter, and a medieval rock-cut temple with excellent fresco paintings comparable to Ajantha paintings; the steep hill contains an isolated but spacious cavern. Locally, this cavern is known as ''"Eladipattam"'', a name that is derived from the seven holes cut into the rock that serve as steps leading to the shelter. Within the cave there are seventeen stone beds aligned in rows; each of these has a raised portion that could have served as a pillow-loft. The largest stone bed has a distinct [[Tamil-Brahmi]] inscription assignable to the 2nd century BCE, and some inscriptions belonging to the 8th century BCE are also found on the nearby beds. The Sittannavasal cavern continued to be the Holy Sramana Abode until the 7th and 8th centuries. Inscriptions over the remaining stone beds name mendicants such as Tol kunrattu Kadavulan, Tirunilan, Tiruppuranan, Tittaicharanan, Sri Purrnacandran, Thiruchatthan, Ilangowthaman, Sri Ulagathithan, and Nityakaran Pattakali as monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=S.

===Pilgrimages===
{{Main|Tirtha (Jainism)}}
Jain ''Tirtha'' ("pilgrim") sites are divided into the following categories:{{sfn|Titze|1998|p=}}
* ''Siddhakshetra''{{snds}}Site of the [[Moksha (Jainism)|''moksha'']] of an ''arihant'' (''kevalin'') or ''tirthankara'', such as: [[Mount Kailash|Ashtapada]], [[Shikharji]], [[Girnar]], [[Pawapuri]], [[Palitana]], [[Mangi-Tungi]], and [[Champapuri]] (capital of [[Anga]]).
* ''Atishayakshetra''{{snds}}Locations where divine events have occurred, such as: [[Mahavirji]], [[Rishabhdeo]], [[Kundalpur]], [[Tijara Jain Temple|Tijara]], and [[Aharji]].
* ''Puranakshetra''{{snds}} Places associated with the lives of great men, such as: [[Ayodhya]], [[Vidisha]], [[Hastinapur]], and [[Rajgir]].
* ''Gyanakshetra''{{snds}} Places associated with famous ''[[acharya]]s'', or centers of learning, such as [[Shravanabelagola]].

Outside contemporary India, Jain communities built temples in locations such as [[Nagarparkar]], [[Sindh]] ([[Pakistan]]). However, according to a UNESCO tentative world heritage site application, Nagarparkar was not a "major religious centre or a place of pilgrimage" for Jainism, but it was once an important cultural landscape before "the last remaining Jain community left the area in 1947 at Partition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6111/ Nagarparkar Cultural Landscape], Tantative List, UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statues and sculptures===
{{Main|Jain sculpture}}

Jain sculptures are mainly images depicting ''tīrthaṅkaras''. A sculpture could depict any of the twenty-four ''tīrthaṅkaras{{'}}s'' images. Parshvanatha, Rishabhanatha and Mahāvīra are among the more popular. These ''tīrthaṅkaras'' usually depicted in the lotus position or ''kayotsarga''.{{sfn|Arora||p=405}} Sculptures of ''chaumukha'' ("quadruple") images are also popular in Jainism. Sculptures of Arihant, [[Bahubali]], and protector deities like [[Ambika (Jainism)|Ambika]] are also found. ''Tirthanakar'' idols look similar and are differentiated by the symbol belonging to each ''tirthanakar'' except Parshvanatha. Statues of Parshvanath have a snake crown on head. There are a few differences between the Digambara and the Śvētāmbara depictions of idols.{{sfn|Cort|2010}} Digambara images are naked without any beautification, whereas Śvētāmbara depictions are clothed and decorated with temporary ornaments.{{sfn|Cort|2010}}

A monolithic, {{convert|18|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off}} statue of Bahubali, referred to as ''[[Gommateshvara]]'', built in 981 CE by the Ganga minister and commander [[Chavundaraya]], is situated on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the [[Hassan district]] of Karnataka state. This statue was voted first in the SMS poll Seven Wonders of India conducted by ''[[The Times of India]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2256323.cms |title=And India's 7 wonders are |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date= 5 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statue of Ahiṃsā]] (depicting Rishabhanatha) was erected in the [[Nashik district]] in 2015; it is {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/70-crore-plan-for-idol-installation-at-Mangi-Tungi/articleshow/50037188.cms |title=70-crore plan for idol installation at Mangi-Tungi |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=4 December 2015 |last=Botekar |first=Abhilash |agency=TNN |location=[[Nashik]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Idols made from ''[[Ashtadhatu]]'' (literally "eight metals"), [[Akota Bronzes|Akota Bronze]], [[brass]], [[gold]], [[silver]], stone [[monolith]]s, [[Rock-cut architecture|rock cut]], and precious stones are popular in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url={{Google books|clUmKaWRFTkC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700|publisher=Los Angeles County Museum of Art|first=Pratapaditya|last=Pal|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jais/hd_jais.htm|title=Met Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of ''ayagapata'', [[votive]] tablets for offerings and the worship of ''tīrthankara'', were excavated from [[Kankali Tila]], [[Mathura]]. These sculptures date from the 2nd century BCE to the 12th century CE.{{sfn|Jain|Fischer|1978|pp=9–10}}

===Symbols===
{{Main|Jain symbols}}
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|The Jain emblem]]
Jain icons and arts incorporate symbols such as swastika, om, and the ''Ashtamangala''.

====Swastika====
The [[swastika]] is an important Jain symbol. Its four arms symbolise the four realms of existence in which rebirth occurs according to Jainism: humans, heavenly beings, hellish beings and non-humans (plants and animals).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=17}}{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=123}} This is conceptually similar to the six realms of rebirth represented by ''[[bhavachakra]]'' in Buddhism.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=17}} It is usually shown with three dots on the top, which represent the three jewels mentioned in ancient texts such as ''Tattvartha sūtra'' and ''Uttaradhyayana sūtra'': correct faith, correct understanding and correct conduct. These jewels are the means believed in Jainism to lead one to the state of spiritual perfection, a state that is symbolically represented by a crescent and one dot on top representing the liberated soul.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=17-18}}

====Symbol of ''Ahiṃsā''====
The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes [[Ahimsa in Jainism|''ahimsā'' in Jainism]] with ''ahiṃsā'' written in the middle. The wheel represents the ''[[dharmachakra]]'' ("Wheel of the Dharma"), which stands for the resolve to halt the ''saṃsāra'' ("wandering") through the relentless pursuit of ''ahimsā'' ("compassion").

====''Om''====
[[File:Om_jaïn_orange.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Om#Jainism|Om]] in Jainism]]
In Jainism, [[Om#Jainism|''Om'']] is considered a condensed form of reference to the ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'', by their initials ''A+A+A+U+M'' (''{{IAST|o[[pluti|3]]}}{{IAST|m}}''). According to the ''[[Dravyasamgraha]]'' by Acharya [[Nemicandra]], ''AAAUM'' (or just ''Om'') is a one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: "''Arihant'', ''[[Ashiri]]'', ''[[Acharya]]'', ''[[Upajjhaya]]'', ''Muni''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/om.html |title=Om – significance in Jainism, Languages and Scripts of India, Colorado State University|work=cs.colostate.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=410–411}} The ''Om'' symbol is also used in ancient Jain scriptures to represent the five lines of the [[Namokara Mantra|''Ṇamōkāra'' Mantra]].{{Sfn|Agarwal|2012|p=135}}{{Sfn|Agarwal|2013|p=80}}

====Jain emblem====
In 1974, on the 2500th anniversary of the nirvana of Mahāvīra, the Jain community chose one image as an emblem to be the main identifying symbol for Jainism.{{Sfn|Robinson|2006|p=225}} The overall shape depicts the three ''loka'' ("realms of rebirth") of Jain cosmology i.e., heaven, human world and hell. The semi-circular topmost portion symbolizes ''Siddhashila'', which is a zone beyond the three realms. The Jain swastika is present in the top portion, and the symbol of ''Ahiṃsā'' in the lower portion. At the bottom of the emblem is the Jain mantra, ''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam|Parasparopagraho Jīvānām]]''. According to Vilas Sangave, the mantra means "all life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence".{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=123}} According to Anne Vallely, this mantra is from sūtra 5.21 of Umaswati's ''Tattvarthasūtra'', and it means "souls render service to one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Vallely|editor=Stephen Bullivant and Michael Ruse|title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism|url={{Google books|93VoAgAAQBAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-166739-8|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jain flag ====
[[File:Jain flag.jpg|thumb|Jain Flag]]
The five colours of the [[Jain flag]] represent the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]'' and the five vows, small as well as great:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=iv}}
* White – represents the ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihants]]'', souls who have conquered all passions (anger, attachments, aversion) and have attained omniscience and eternal bliss through self-realisation. It also denotes peace or ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence ").
* Red – represents the ''[[Siddha]]'', souls that have attained salvation and truth. It also denotes ''satya''  ("truthfulness")
* Yellow – represents the [[Acharya (Jainism)|''acharya'']] the Masters of Adepts. The colour also stands for ''achaurva'' ("non-stealing").
* Green – represents the ''[[upadhyaya]]'' ("adepts"), those who teach scriptures to monks. It also signifies ''[[brahmacharya]]'' ("chastity").
* Black – represents the [[Jain ascetics]].  It also signifies ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-possession").

====''Ashtamangala''====
The ''[[Ashtamangala]]'' are a set of eight auspicious symbols, which are different in the Digambara and Śvētāmbar traditions.{{sfn|Titze|1998|p=234}}

In the Digambara tradition, the eight auspicious symbols are [[Chatra (umbrella)|Chatra]], ''[[Dhvaja]]'', ''[[Kalasha]]'', [[Chaamara]], [[Mirror]], Chair, [[Hand fan]] and Vessel. In the Śvētāmbar tradition, these are Swastika, ''[[Srivatsa]]'', ''[[Nandavarta]]'', ''Vardhmanaka'' ("food vessel"), ''Bhadrasana'' ("seat"), ''[[Kalasha]]'' ("pot"), ''Darpan'' ("mirror") and pair of fish.{{Sfn|Titze|1998|p=234}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Jainism}}
[[File:Photo of lord adinath bhagwan at kundalpur.JPG|thumb|[[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdev]], believed to have lived over a million years ago, is considered the traditional founder of Jainism.]]

===Origins===
{{See also|Timeline of Jainism|Śramaṇa}}

The origins of Jainism are obscure.{{sfn|Rankin|Mardia|2013|p=975}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=13}} The Jains claim their religion to be eternal, and consider [[Rishabhanatha]] to be the founder in the present time-cycle, the first of 24 Jain ''tirthankaras'' in Jain belief, and someone who lived for 8,400,000 purva years.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=16}} According to one hypothesis, such as one by [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], the first vice president of India, Jainism was in existence before the Vedas were composed.{{sfn|Jambuvijaya|2002|p=114}}{{sfn|Pande|1957|p=353}} According to historians, the first 22 of the 24 ''tirthankaras'' were mythical figures. These figures were supposed to have lived more than 85,000 years ago. They were five to hundred times taller than average human beings and lived for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Rishabhanatha, in ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rishabhanatha |publisher=Editors of the Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sangave|2001|pp=104, 129}}{{sfn|Saraswati|1908|p=444}} The 23rd ''tirthankara'', [[Parshvanatha]], is generally accepted to be based on an ancient historic human being{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|pp=183}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Paul |last=Dundas |title=Jainism |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |date=2013 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/299478/Jainism }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=10}} of uncertain dates, possibly 8th–7th century BCE.

Some confessional Jain scholars such as Parikh have argued that some images such as those of the bull in [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seal may be related to Jainism, but such claims are highly speculative and a subjective interpretation. This theory has not been accepted by most scholars because very little is known about the Indus Valley iconography and script.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=53-54}} Jainism, like Buddhism, is one of the ''[[Sramana]]'' traditions of ancient India, those that rejected the [[Veda]]s and developed their own scriptures.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=639}}&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

There is inscriptional evidence for the presence of Jain monks in south India by the second or first centuries BC, and archaeological evidence of Jain monks in Saurashtra in Gujarat by the second century CE.{{sfn|Cort|2010|p=202}} Statues of Jain ''tirthankara'' have been found dating back to second century BC.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=444}}

===Political history===
[[File:Udayagiri Caves - Rani Gumpha 01.jpg|thumb|[[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves]] built by [[King Kharavela]] of [[Mahameghavahana dynasty]] in 2nd century BCE]]
Information regarding the political history of Jainism is uncertain and fragmentary. Jains consider the king [[Bimbisara]] (c. 558–491 BCE), [[Ajatashatru]] (c. 492–460 BCE), and [[Udayin]] (c. 460-440 BCE) of the [[Haryanka dynasty]] as a patron of Jainism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=41}}

Jain tradition states that [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (322–298 BCE), the founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]] and grandfather of [[Ashoka]], became a monk and disciple of Jain ascetic [[Bhadrabahu]] during later part of his life. According to historians, Chandragupta's story appears in various versions in Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu texts.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=4–21, 232–237}} Broadly, Chandragupta was born into a humble family, abandoned, raised as a son by another family, then with the training and counsel of Chanakya of ''[[Arthashastra]]'' fame ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient India.&lt;ref name=britchandrag&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chandragupta Chandragupta Maurya, EMPEROR OF INDIA], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothermund2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|author=Roger Boesche|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url={{Google books|K85NA7Rg67wC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-0607-5|pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jain history, late in his life, Chandragupta renounced the empire he built and handed over his power to his son, became a Jaina monk, and headed to meditate and pursue spirituality in the Deccan region, under the Jaina teacher Bhadrabahu at Shravanabelagola.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=42}} There state Jain texts, he died by fasting, a Jaina ascetic method of ending one's life by choice (''Sallenkana vrata'').&lt;ref name=britchandrag/&gt;{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=39–46, 234-236}}&lt;ref name="Rothermund2004p63"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hermann Kulke|author2=Dietmar Rothermund|title=A History of India|url={{Google books|RoW9GuFJ9GIC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-32920-0|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd century BCE emperor Ashoka, in his pillar edicts, mentions several ancient Indian religious groups including the ''Niganthas'' (Jaina).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=43}}

According to another Jain legend, King [[Salivahana]] of the late 1st century CE was a patron of Jainism, as were many others in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE. But von Glasenapp states that the historicity of these stories is difficult to establish.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=51}} Archeological evidence suggests that Mathura was an important Jain centre between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE. Inscriptions from the 1st and 2nd century CE show that the schism between Digambara and Śvētāmbara had already taken place.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=49}}

King Harshavardhana of the 7th century grew up in [[Shaivism]], following his family, but he championed Jainism, Buddhism and all traditions of Hinduism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=52}} King Ama of the 8th century converted to Jainism, and the Jaina pilgrimage tradition was well established in his era.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=52-54}} Mularaja, the founder of [[Chalukya dynasty]], constructed a Jain temple, even though he was not a Jain.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=56}}

In the second half of the 1st century CE, Hindu kings sponsored and helped build major Jaina cave temples. For example, the Hindu [[Rashtrakuta]] dynasty started the early group of Jain temples,&lt;ref name=pereira21&gt;{{cite book|author=José Pereira|title=Monolithic Jinas|url={{Google books|LMTgiygj4-oC|page=PA24|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1977|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-2397-6|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava dynasty]] built many of the middle and later Jain group of temples at the [[Ellora Caves]] between 700 and 1000 CE.&lt;ref name=asiintro&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_ellora.asp World Heritage Sites - Ellora Caves], Archeological Survey of India (2011), Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 178|editor=K.S.

Buddhist texts refer to Mahāvīra as ''Nigantha Nataputta''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=105}}

Beyond the times of the Mahāvīra and the Buddha, the two ascetic ''sramana'' ("seeker") religions competed for followers as well as the merchant trade networks that sustained them.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1993|pp=4–7}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Neelis|title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia|url={{Google books|GB-JV2eOr2UC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18159-8|pages=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mutual interaction, along with those of Hindu traditions, have been significant. In some cases the titles of the Buddhist and Jaina texts are the same or similar but present different doctrines.{{sfn|Dundas|2003b|pp=ix–xi, 151–162}}

Royal patronage has been a key factor in the growth as well as the decline of Jainism.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=69–70}} The Pallava King [[Mahendravarman I]] (600{{nsndns}}630 CE) converted from Jainism to Shaivism under the influence of [[Appar]].{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=409}} His work ''[[Mattavilasa Prahasana]]'' ridicules certain Shaiva sects and the Buddhists and also expresses contempt towards Jain ascetics.{{sfn|Arunachalam|1981|p=170}} Sambandar converted the contemporary [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]] king to Shaivism. During the 11th century, [[Basava]], a minister to the Jain [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalachuri]] king [[Bijjala II|Bijjala]], succeeded in converting numerous Jains to the [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] Shaivite sect. The Lingayats destroyed various temples belonging to Jains and adapted them to their use.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=75–77}} The [[Hoysala Dynasty|Hoysala]] King [[Vishnuvardhana]] (c.{{nbsp}}1108{{nsndns}}1152 CE) became a follower of the [[Vaishnava]] sect under the influence of [[Ramanuja]], after which Vaishnavism grew rapidly in what is now Karnataka.{{sfn|Das|2005|p=161}}

[[File:La grotte Jain Indra Sabha Ellora Caves, India.jpg|thumb|left|The Indra Sabha cave at the [[Ellora Caves]], are co-located with Hindu and Buddhist monuments.]]
Jainism and Hinduism influenced each other. Jain texts declare some of the Hindu gods as blood relatives of legendary ''tirthankara''. Neminatha, the 22nd ''tirthankara'' for example is presented as a cousin of Krishna in Jain Puranas and other texts.&lt;ref name=britneminatha&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arishtanemi Arishtanemi: JAINA SAINT], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Long|2009|p=42}} However, Jain scholars such as [[Haribhadra]] also wrote satires about Hindu gods, mocking them with novel outrageous stories where the gods misbehave and act unethically.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=236-237}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

In other stories, one or more Jinas easily defeat the Hindu deities such as [[Vishnu]], or [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] who come to pay respect to a Jina at a major Jain pilgrimage site such as Mount Satrunjaya.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=113-115, 222-223, 236-237}}

The Jain and Hindu communities have often been very close and mutually accepting.

Jainism faced persecution during and after the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=145-146, 124}} Muslims rulers, such as [[Mahmud Ghazni]] (1001), [[Mohammad Ghori]] (1175) and [[Alauddin Khalji|Ala-ud-din Muhammed Shah Khalji]] (1298) further oppressed the Jain community.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=74–75}} They vandalised idols and destroyed temples or converted them into mosques. They also burned Jain books and killed Jains. There were significant exceptions, such as Emperor [[Akbar]] (1542{{nsndns}}1605) whose legendary religious tolerance, out of respect for Jains, ordered the release of caged birds and banned the killing of animals on the Jain festival of Paryusan.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=146}} After Akbar, Jains faced an intense period of Muslim persecution in the 17th century.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=220-221}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Truschke|first=Audrey|date=2015-09-01|title=Dangerous Debates: Jain responses to theological challenges at the Mughal court*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies/article/dangerous-debates-jain-responses-to-theological-challenges-at-the-mughal-court/8A3F928B34C46E3583FF6577968805A4|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=49|issue=5|pages=1311–1344|doi=10.1017/S0026749X14000055|issn=0026-749X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain community were the traditional bankers and financiers, and this significantly impacted the Muslim rulers. However, they rarely were a part of the political power during the Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Cort|1998|pp=85-86}}

===Colonial era===
Colonial era reports and Christian missions variously viewed Jainism as either a sect of Hinduism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=British India|title=Various Census of India: 1871-1872|url={{Google books|4AEJAAAAQAAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=1867|publisher=Government of India|pages=31 note 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Buddhism, or as a distinct religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Washburn Hopkins|title=The Religions of India|url={{Google books|O0IvAAAAYAAJ|page=PA283|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1902|publisher=Ginn &amp; Company|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J.

These criticisms, states [[John E. Cort|John Cort]], were flawed and also ignored similar practices within sects of Christianity.{{sfn|Cort|2010|pp=12-16, 200-207, 218-219, 251 with note 10}}

The British colonial government in India, as well as Indian princely states, passed laws that made monks roaming naked in streets a crime, one that led to arrest. This law particularly impacted the Digambara monks.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=348–349}} The Akhil Bharatiya Jaina Samaj opposed this law, and argued that it interfered with the religious rights of Jains. Acharya [[Shantisagar]] entered Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1927, but was forced to cover his body. He then led an India-wide tour as the naked monk with his followers, to various Digambara sacred sites, and was welcomed by kings of the Maharashtra provinces.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=348–349}} Shantisagar fasted to oppose the restrictions imposed on Digambara monks by the [[British Raj]] and prompted their discontinuance.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=56}} The colonial era laws that banned naked monks remained effective through World War II, but they were abolished by independent India after it gained independence.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=359–360}}

&lt;/ref&gt; used to invoke spiritual guidance and protection.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;"[http://maori.otago.ac.nz/reo-tikanga-treaty/te-reo/karakia Karakia]", Otago University website. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Karakia'' are generally used to increase the spiritual goodwill of a gathering, so as to increase the likelihood of a favourable outcome. They are also considered a formal greeting when beginning a [[ceremony]]. According to legend, there was a curse on the [[Waiapu River]] which was lifted when [[George Gage (Ringatū minister)|George Gage]] (Hori Keeti) performed ''karakia''. In the [[Māori religion]], ''karakia'' are used to [[ritual|ritually cleanse]] the homes of the deceased after a burial. 

The missionary [[Richard Taylor (missionary) | Richard Taylor]] gives a 19th-century view of the traditional role and scope of ''karakia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word ''karakia'', which we use for prayer, formerly meant a spell, charm, or incantation [...] [Maori] have spells suited for all circumstances - to conquer enemies, catch fish, trap rats, and snare birds, to make their kumara grow, and even to bind the obstinate will of woman; to find anything lost; to discover a stray dog; a concealed enemy; in fact, for all their wants. These karakias are extremely numerous [...]&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = The word ''karakia'', which we use for prayer, formerly meant a spell, charm, or incantation [...] [Maori] have spells suited for all circumstances - to conquer enemies, catch fish, trap rats, and snare birds, to make their kumara grow, and even to bind the obstinate will of woman; to find anything lost; to discover a stray dog; a concealed enemy; in fact, for all their wants. These karakias are extremely numerous [...]
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the nineteenth-century introduction of Christianity to New Zealand, Māori adopted (or wrote new)  karakia to acknowledge the new faith. Modern karakia tend to contain a blend of Christian and traditional influence, and their poetic language may make literal translations into English not always possible.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;"[http://maori.otago.ac.nz/reo-tikanga-treaty/te-reo/karakia Karakia]", Otago University website. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Māori society, performances of ''karakia'' frequently open important meetings and ceremonies, both within a Māori context (such as tribal [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]], [[tangihanga|tangi]], or the inauguration of new [[marae]]), and in a wider New Zealand setting in which both Māori and [[Pākehā]] participate (such as the beginning of public meetings or at the departure of official delegations for overseas).

'''''Libertas ecclesiae''''' ("freedom of the Church" in [[Latin]]) is the notion of freedom of ecclesiastical authority from secular or the temporal power, which guided the [[Gregorian Reform|Reform]] movement which began in the 11th century.

==Description==
After the decentralization of the post-Carolingian period, this became the slogan of the Church in light of disapproval over lay warlords installing themselves as abbots and other high-profile churchmen. Unfit to perform theological functions, much less to defend the interests of the Church, these warlords viewed Church property as an extension of their own landholdings.

What resulted was the plunder of movable wealth (of which the monasteries had become the keepers during the period of Viking invasion) and the parcelling out of land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.

In addition to calling for spiritually pure figures at the helm of the Church, Gregory VII addressed the practical problems of pluralism (holding more than one church office) and poorly educated clerics.

[[Neopaganism]] (also [[modern paganism]] or contemporary paganism) encompasses a wide range of religious groups and individuals. These may include old [[occult]] groups, those that follow a [[New Age]] approach, those that try to reconstruct old [[ethnic religion]]s, and followers of the pagan religion of [[Wicca]]. For organizations, the founding year is given in brackets.

== Early movements ==

{{main|Wicca|Contemporary witchcraft}}
{{see also|Category: Wiccan traditions}}
Wicca originated in 1940s Britain and became the mainstream of [[Neopaganism in the United States]] in the 1970s. There are two core traditions of Wicca which originated in Britain, Gardnerian and Alexandrian, which are sometimes referred to as British Traditional Wicca. From these two arose several other variant traditions. Wicca has also inspired a great number of other [[witchcraft]] traditions in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], most of which base their beliefs and practices on Wicca. Many movements are influenced by the [[Goddess movement|Movement of the Goddess]], and [[New Age]] and [[feminism|feminist]] worldviews.

The declaration has been widely welcomed. Some commentators called for consistent legal and practical follow through of the sentiments expressed including in the country where the declaration was forged, which does not recognise its own indigenous Christians and persecutes and imprisons them,&lt;ref name=Ibrahim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2016/02/01/history-suggests-marrakesh-declaration-no-guarantee-religious-freedom-commentary/ |title=History suggests Marrakesh Declaration no guarantee of religious freedom |last=Ibrahim |first=Ayman |date=1 February 2016 |publisher=[[Religion News Service]] |language=English |accessdate=2 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6f0Ie8tSk?url=http://www.religionnews.com/2016/02/01/history-suggests-marrakesh-declaration-no-guarantee-religious-freedom-commentary/ |archive-date=2 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persecution.org/awareness/persecuted-countries/morocco |title=Country profile Morocco from International Christian Concern |publisher=International Christian Concern |language=English |accessdate=2 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6f0YWJuEk?url=http://www.persecution.org/awareness/persecuted-countries/morocco |archive-date=3 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the [[Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia| birthplace of Islam]], where there are reportedly many Saudi Christians.&lt;ref name= Ibrahim/&gt;

The concept originated in the mid 19th century, continued into the mid 20th century as a low-key phenomenon, and expanded rapidly through the 1980s and 1990s; it is widely seen across the US in the early 21st century. 
==History==
[[Image:NorthRidge church Plymouth Michigan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|NorthRidge megachurch [[Plymouth, Michigan]]]]
The origins of the megachurch movement, with a large number of local congregants who return on a weekly basis can be traced to the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt; Anne C. Loveland, Otis B.

Examples include [[Charles Spurgeon]]'s Baptist [[Metropolitan Tabernacle]] in London which attracted 5,000 weekly for years in the late 19th century, and [[televangelism|religious broadcaster]] [[Aimee Semple McPherson]]'s [[Angelus Temple]] in Los Angeles, of similar size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2136&amp;ResourceType=Building ''Angelus Temple''.] [[National Historic Landmarks Program]], NPS&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''minority religion''' is a [[religion]] held by a [[Minority group|minority]] of the population of a country, state, or region. Minority religions may be subject to [[Social stigma|stigma]] or [[discrimination]]. An example of a stigma is using the term [[cult]] with its extremely negative connotations for certain [[new religious movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/115621228/Why-the-Bruderhof-is-not-a-cult-by-Bryan-Wilson|title=Why the Bruderhof is not a cult - by Bryan Wilson {{!}} Cult And Sect {{!}} Religion And Belief|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who belong to a minority religion may be subject to discrimination and prejudice, especially when the religious differences correlate with [[ethnic]] differences.

Laws are made in some countries to protect the rights of religious minorities, such as protecting the minorities' culture and to promote harmony with the majority.

{{Ayyavazhi}}
'''Neetham''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:&lt;small&gt;நீதம்&lt;/small&gt;) are the primary virtues to be followed according to the [[Akilam]] the holy text of [[Ayyavazhi]]. They are found in [[Akilam one]], which is the first section of the [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]], and in the middle of the [[meta-narrative]] events of the [[:Category:Eight Yugas|eight yugas]]. This shows that the society, its people, and the ruling king once lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of God in all their works, deeds, and activities during early ages.

The [[Akilam]] points this out as an example, and describes how the people should live in the world. It also forms a part of [[Ayyavazhi]] ethics. The Neethams are split into three. They are,

# '''Manu Neetham''': How an individual should personify him/herself with good morality.
# '''Raja Neetham''': How an individual should be to the society or Nation, and in turn how the Nation should be to a common man.
# '''Deiva Neetham''': How an individual should be before God.

== Manu Neetham — Justice of Common Man==

The '''Manu Neetham''' describes how a person should act in society. It also describes the correct [[moral]] character of the people, and their way of life in harmony with nature (particularly women) in the early ages.

Followers believe that all the events and actions that happen in their lives are activated by [[God]]. Therefore, they prefer not to seek any individual supremacy for any of their activities or achievements. All faithful followers believe that everyone is equal, in spite of the presence of different castes.

In addition, they do not find anyone inferior or superior to others with respect to the jobs they do. They neither do any menial jobs nor make others do so. In turn, they live with a mutual understanding of others not unlike the innocence of children.

===Morality===

*[[virginity]] is treated with highest respect, especially in women.
**This not only means physical virginity, but a kind of mental "virginity" as well.
***This is described as keeping one's mind clear, and not allowing the mind to become "instable" or "impure". In other words, virginity also means preserving moral and virginal thinking.
**Because of this, [[Women]] do not speak often.
*Followers are to respect their [[father]] and [[mother]], and keep them at equal status with [[God]].
*Honesty is considered an important virtue.
*Women are taught to respect their [[husband]]s.
**[[Wives]] sleep only after making their husbands sleep.
***For example, women will wake up and bathe before dawn, [[prayer|pray]], then clean the house as part of her daily routine.

Thus the people of the [[society]] would live: always striving to be role models for others. This [[ethical]] code is considered by followers to have been given by [[Ayyavazhi]] scriptures to mankind.

== Raja Neetham — Justice of Governance==

This '''Raja Neetham''' or '''Arasa Neetham''' says, how an individual should be to the [[society]] or [[nation]], and in turn how the nation should be to a common [[man]]. This was derived from the meta-narrative events, one practiced in the society.

The king ruled the country with great care, by giving more importance to individual needs. He respect each and every individual with equal status. The king consider the comfort of the subjects of the nation as the comfort of himself. In all the 1008 Pathis (The place where [[God]] is) the [[puja (Hinduism)|pooja]]s were conducted rightly and in timely manner. The [[temples]], the watermeans such as [[pond]]s, [[Water well|well]]s were supervised and were repaired frequently. [[Anna Dharmam]], the charity on food is conducted frequently at choultries. The people of the nation always respect religious persons and [[pilgrims]], and help them by all possible means, and consider that serving them (religious persons) is like serving God.

The king collects one-sixth of the means of people as [[tax]]. If  any one says that they will not be able to give one-sixth of their means, the king don't use to compel them. If any one pays tax without any pending for about twelve years the King use to discount their tax for two years. The judgement from the king for the judicial cases of people will be accurate. He gives more importance for his people than for himself.

===Right Judgement===

This story tells about a king who follows the Raja Neetham rightly and so his accuracy in judgement.

Once a [[hunter]] choose a bird as his target and points his arrow towards it. The bird notes this and flies away and the hunter follows the bird. The bird flew and fell in front of the Chozha king and asked him to rescue from the hunter. Following this the hunter came in front of the king and demanded the bird. He also says, "whole of my today's time is wasted behind this bird. I and my family has to fulfill our hunger by this bird." On the other hand, the bird demanded the king to save it from the hunter.

The king feels that both of them are right from their own view point and sensed both the fulfillment of the hunger of hunter and saving the life of the bird is his duty as a king. So taking care the two subjects, the king cut an equal quantity of [[flesh]] to the bird from his limb and gave it to the hunter. So he saved the life of the bird and on the other hand saved the hunter's family from being hungry. As king, he treated both of his subjects equally and also fulfilled both of their needs.

&lt;small&gt;''Note: This story is not fully narrated as above in [[Akilam]] and only quoted.''&lt;/small&gt;

== Deiva Neetham — Justice of Divinity==

This '''Deiva Neetham''' tells about the thought of people about the Almighty and about their religious harmony during that (old) age, and tells the way by which one should be get divinized. The most important point is, this part says that when the other two Neethams are correctly followed the Deiva Neetham will be automatically fall in the right path. This concept was reveals from the [[mythical]] narration.

The reign of the king (above in Raja Neetham) was identified as a good rule by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]. [[Narayana]], [[Brahma]], [[Lekhsmi]] and all devas appreciated this rule. They went to [[Mount Kailash|kayilai]] to meet [[Shiva|Siva]] to tell about this.

They met Siva in Kayilai and told that the King chozha is ruling his country genuinely. They also told Siva about the judgement of the king in the matter of the '''Hunter and the Bird'''. Also they brought to his attention, other merits of the reign of the king. They also demanded that, since the king is so genuine, talented and accurate in following the principles, he should order the devas to do the duties to his nation correctly. Hearing this Siva ordered the [[Krishna|Mayon]] to order the devas to do all duties timidly. As per this Mayon ordered,

*  [[Bhoomaadevi]], goddess of [[earth]] to protect his nation.
*  [[Varuna]], the [[God of Rain]] to shed rain thrice a month in the country of that king.
*  The [[clouds]] to act as an umbrella and protect his nation.
*  [[Vayu]], the [[God of Wind]] to fan his nation with gentle breeze.
*  [[Sivayu]]s to be alert on the places where the poojas are held in his nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">'''Nirankar''' ({{Lang-pa|ਨਿਰੰਕਾਰ}} ) is one of the many attributes associated to God in Sikh philosophy and means ''The Formless One''. The word has its roots in {{Lang-sa|ਨਿਰਾਕਾਰਾ/निराकारा}} ''nirākārā'' and is a compound of two words "Nir" meaning Without and Akar (or Akaar), Shape or Form; hence, The Formless. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/god-in-sikhism-3|title=God in Sikhism 3|website=www.speakingtree.in|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as a name for The Almighty in [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

{{Quote|text=ਸਚ ਖੰਡਿ ਵਸੈ ਨਿਰੰਕਾਰੁ ॥

सच खंडि वसै निरंकारु ॥

Sacẖ kẖand vasai nirankār.

In the realm of Truth abides the Formless Lord.|sign=SGGS. Pg 8|source=}}

"The actual meaning of "Nirankar" is Waheguru, Allah, God, and Ishbar. It describes that God is formless and omnipresent. We all are made by Nirankar. Only the name of "Religions" are different. But the supreme power is same in actual. We all are one and belongs to one Lord master(Nirankar)."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28041">This article on '''nudity in religion''' deals with the differing attitudes to [[nudity]] and [[modesty]] among world [[religion]]s.

==Ancient Greek religion==
[[File:Venere di Milo 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of ''[[Aphrodite of Milos]]'', the Greek goddess of love and beauty, ({{circa|100}} BC), [[Louvre]]]]
[[Hesiod]] the writer of the poem ''[[Theogony]]'', which describes the origins and genealogies of the [[Greek gods]] in [[Ancient Greek religion]], suggested that farmers should "Sow naked, and plough naked, and harvest naked, if you wish to bring in all [[Demeter]]'s fruits in due season."{{sfn|Villing|2010|p=40}} [[Demeter]] is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, who presided over grains and the fertility of the earth.

== Abrahamic religions ==

The [[Abrahamic religion]]s of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all recount the legend of the [[Garden of Eden]], found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] are unaware of their nakedness until they eat the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]].  After this, they feel ashamed and try to cover themselves with fig leaves.{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:74|NIV}} Judaism does not share the Christian association of nakedness with [[original sin]], an aspect integral to the doctrine of redemption and salvation. In Islam the garden is in Paradise, not on Earth. {{efn|when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies.{{Cite quran|7|22}} }} This is to show that women and men should be covered in clothing, for nudity has the stigma of shame attached to it.{{efn|O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame, and (clothing) for beauty and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best.{{Cite quran|7|26}} }} Each of these religions has its own unique understanding of what is meant to be taught with the recounting of the story of Adam and Eve.

=== Judaism ===
{{see also|Tzniut}}

In Judaism, nudity is an aspect of [[body modesty]] which is regarded as very important in most social and familial situations. Attitudes to modesty vary between the different movements within Judaism as well as between communities within each movement. In more strict (orthodox) communities, modesty is an aspect of [[Tzniut]] which generally has detailed rules of what is appropriate behaviour. [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]] generally promote modesty values but do not regard the strict Tzniut rules as binding, with each person being permitted (at least in principle) to set their own standards. With the exception of the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community, Jewish communities generally tend to dress according to the standards of the society in which they find themselves.

A person who enters a ritual bath (a ''[[mikveh]]'') does so without clothing, and with no jewelry or even bandages.

Care needs to be taken when reading the Bible, where some references to nakedness serve as a euphemism for intimate sexual behaviour.{{sfn|Telushkin|1977|p=17-18}} For example, in the story of Noah we see the hesitancy of two of [[Noah]]'s sons when they have to cover their father's nakedness, averting their eyes, after Noah's youngest son "saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside" what he had done to his father.{{efn|[Noah] drank the wine [of his vineyard] and became drunk. He uncovered himself inside his tent. Ham saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their backs, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And when Noah awoke and learned what [Ham] had done to him, he said "Cursed be Canaan [Ham's son], the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:21-25|NIV}} }}{{efn|it has been suggested that this episode involved Ham doing more than just viewing his father's nakedness.{{sfn|Edwards|1978|p=113}} }} Nakedness may also be a metaphor for empty-handedness, specifically in situations where a sacrifice or offering to God is expected.

=== Christianity ===

[[File:Baptism - Marcellinus and Peter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Representation of baptism in early Christian art]]
[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|upright|Baptism of [[Clovis I]] (496)]]
''{{Main article|Christian naturism}}''

The early Christian Church reflected the contemporary attitudes of Judaism towards nudity. The Old Testament is not positive towards nudity.{{sfn|Knights|1999}} In the [[Old Testament]], Isaiah in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|20|NIV}} walk nude as a sign of shame against Egypt. 

The first recorded [[liturgy]] of [[baptism]], written down by Saint [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in his ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', required men, women and children to remove all clothing, including all foreign objects such as jewellery and hair fastenings.{{sfn |Hippolytus|2013|p=33}} {{harvtxt|Guy|2003}}, however argues that complete nudity for baptism candidates (especially women) would not be the norm. He notes that at certain times and in certain places candidates may have been totally naked at the point of baptism, but the Jewish taboo of female nakedness would have mitigated widespread practice of naked baptism.

Later [[Christian]] attitudes to nudity became more restrictive, and baptisms were segregated by sex and then later were usually performed with clothed participants. Some of the [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es today maintain the early church's liturgical use of baptismal nudity, particularly for infants but also for adults.

Several saints, such as a number of the [[Desert Fathers]] as well as [[Basil Fool for Christ]], practiced nudity as a form of [[ascetic]] poverty.

Early Christian art included depictions of nudity in baptism. When artistic endeavours revived following the [[Renaissance]], the [[Catholic Church]] was a major sponsor of art bearing a religious theme, many of which included subjects in various states of dress and including full nudity. Painters sponsored by the Church included [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Michelangelo]], but there were many others. Many of these paintings and statues were and continue to be displayed in churches, some of which were painted as murals, the most famous of which are at the [[Sistine Chapel]] painted by Michelangelo.

{{harvtxt|Smith|1966}}, in discussing [[logion]] 37{{efn|Jesus' disciples ask, "When will you be revealed to us and when will we see you? Jesus said: When you unclothe yourselves without being ashamed and take off your clothes and put them under your feet as little children and tread on them, then [shall you see] the Son of the Living One and you shall not fear"&lt;ref name="free_Gosp"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Gospel of Thomas Translated by Paterson Brown | author =  | work = freelyreceive.net | date =  | accessdate = 2016-07-18 | url = http://freelyreceive.net/metalogos/files/thomas.html#37 | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 }} of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], notes that early Christian art depicts,{{sfn|Wilpert|1929}} as one would expect, Adam and Eve in Paradise naked. The only other Old Testament figures who are depicted nude are [[Jonah]] emerging from the mouth of the Great Fish, [[Daniel]] emerging from the Lion's Den, and the resurrected in [[Ezekiel]]'s vision of the dry bones:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref |Ezekiel|37:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; these Old Testament scenes containing nude figures are precisely those which were held to be types of the [[resurrection]]. Among the New Testament illustrations, apart from baptismal scenes, there are nudes only in one representation of the raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and one representation of the [[Miracle at Cana]].

In 1981, [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed the Catholic Church's attitude to the exposure of the human body in ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'': "The human body can remain nude and uncovered and preserve intact its splendour and its beauty... Nakedness as such is not to be equated with physical shamelessness... Immodesty is present only when nakedness plays a negative role with regard to the value of the person... The human body is not in itself shameful... Shamelessness (just like shame and modesty) is a function of the interior of a person."{{sfn|Wojtyla|2013|p=}}

=== Christian sects ===

Sects have arisen within [[Christianity]] from time to time that have viewed nudity in a more positive light. For example, to the [[Adamites]] and the [[Freedomites]] social nudity was an integral part of their ritual.

Today, [[Christian naturist]]s maintain that [[naturism|social nudity]] is a normal part of Christianity and is acceptable. {{harvtxt|De Clercq|2011}} argues that the significance of the human need for clothing by far exceeds its theological meaning.

=== Islam ===

''{{Main article|Intimate parts in Islam}}''

In [[Islam]] the area of the body not meant to be exposed in public is called the ''[[awrah]]'', and while referred to in the [[Qur'an]], is addressed in more detail in [[hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bukhari:6:60:282|url=http://www.sultan.org/books/bukhari/060.htm#006.060.282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4091|url=http://www.2muslims.com/directory/hadith/sunnan_abu_dawud/32/4091}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sunni tradition, the male ''awrah'' is from the navel to knees. Other denominations have differing interpretations. For women, there are different classifications of ''awrah''. In public, many Muslim women wear the [[hijab]] and long dresses which covers most of their head and body, with only specific body parts such as hands and face exposed. But in front of direct family (parents, children, siblings), the ''awrah'' is relaxed further, allowing them to be uncovered, except between the chest and the thighs. [[Sharia]] law in some Islamic countries requires women to observe [[purdah]], covering their entire bodies, including the face (see [[niqab]] and [[burqa]]), However, the degrees of covering vary according to local custom and/or interpretation of Sharia law.

* '''For men''', the [[awrah]] is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (not inclusive according to the [[Shafi'i]]s, [[Hanbali]]s and [[Maliki]]s; inclusive according to the [[Hanafi]]s). However, in most Islamic cultures, a man is frowned upon should he walk around in public without covering the upper half of his body.
* '''For women''', in front of non-[[mahram]] men and non-Muslim women, the [[awrah]] is the whole body, apart from the hands and the face (and, solely according to the Hanafis, the feet). In front of Muslim women it is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (not inclusive according to the [[Shafi'i]]s, [[Hanbali]]s and [[Maliki]]s, inclusive according to the [[Hanafi]]s), and with [[mahram]] men there are three opinions:
# It is from the shoulders (inclusive) down to the knees (inclusive). ([[Hanbali]] opinion)
# It is from the stomach (inclusive) down to the knees (inclusive according to the [[Hanafis]], but not according to the [[Shafi'i]]s and [[Maliki]]s). ([[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Maliki]] opinion)
# It is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (inclusive) when with either. (Alternate [[Hanafi]] opinion)

* '''For both genders''', it is encouraged to wear loose clothing. Note that the awrah is not necessarily what is preferable to wear but what is the bare minimum. It is reported that [[Muhammad]] said, "Modesty is a part of faith."&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari and Muslim&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian religions ==

[[File:Naga baba.jpg|thumb|right|Naga mystics, at the Hindu bathing ceremony of Ardha [[Kumbh Mela]], at [[Allahabad]]]]

In ancient [[Indian Subcontinent|Indian]] cultures, there was a tradition of extreme asceticism (obviously [[minoritarian]]) that included full nudity. This tradition continued from the [[gymnosophists]] (philosophers in antiquity) to certain holy men (who may however cover themselves with ashes) in present-day [[Hindu]] devotion and in [[Jainism]].

=== Hinduism ===
====Philosophical basis====
The philosophical basis of nudity arises out of the concept of ‘Purushartha’ (four ends of human life). ‘Purushartha’ ([[Puruṣārtha]]) are ‘Kama’ (enjoyment), ‘Artha’ (wealth), ‘Dharma’ (virtue) and ‘Moksha’ (liberation). It is ‘Purushartha’ which impels a human being towards nudity or any of its related aspect(s) either for spiritual aim or for the aim of enjoyment. Practice of ‘Dharma’ (virtue) brings good result(s) and non-practice of ‘Dharma’ leads to negative result(s).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) pp.9 and 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;
=====Spiritual basis=====
In the spiritual aspect of Hinduism nudity symbolizes renunciation ('tyaga' in Hindi) of the highest type. A nude person or deity (for example [[Kali]] is a nude deity) denotes one who is devoid of [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] or attachment to the body and one who is an embodiment of infinity. &lt;ref&gt;Pravrajika Vedantaprana, Saptahik Bartaman, Volume 28, Issue 23, Bartaman Private Ltd., 6, JBS Haldane Avenue, 700 105 (ed. 10 October, 2015) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Trailanga Swami]], the famous nude saint of India, had given an explanation for nudity in religion in the following words, “Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him. While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received that perfect Self-realization which I have sought by renouncing everything – even my loincloth!”&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 31: An Interview with the Sacred Mother, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Material basis=====
In comparison in the material aspect nudity is considered an art. This view is supported by Sri Aurobindo in his book ''The Renaissance in India''. He says about Hinduism in the book – “Its spiritual extremism could not prevent it from fathoming through a long era the life of the senses and its enjoyments, and there too it sought the utmost richness of sensuous detail and the depths and intensities of sensual experience. Yet it is notable that this pursuit of the most opposite extremes never resulted in disorder…”&lt;ref&gt; SRINVANTU Magazine, 63, College Street, Kolkata – 700 073(ed. 8th June, 2018) pp.26 and 28 (Website: http://srinvantu.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;
Extreme hedonists and materialists like the [[Charvaka]]s are very candid with regard to pursuing of sensual pleasures. They say, “Marthakamaveva purusharthau” (Riches and pleasure is the summum bonum of life). ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;There is another sloka in support of their view – “Anganalingananadijanyam sukhameva purusatha” (The sensual pleasure arising from the embrace of a woman and other objects is the highest good or end) ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
For non-hedonists pursuing [[kama]] (sensual pleasures) accompanied with [[dharma]] (virtue) can be the highest ideal or goal in life. There is nothing wrong in it. ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occurrence====
Some of the famous nude male and female yogi (male and female saints of India) of Hinduism include Lalla Yogishwari ([[Lalleshwari]]) &lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 20: We Do Not Visit Kashmir, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;, Trailanga Swami, Harihar Baba, Tota Puri. &lt;ref&gt;Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) pp. 187 and 251&lt;/ref&gt;Also in the biography of saint Gorakhnath we have reference to  nude male and female yogis who had visited the famous Amarnath Temple during medieval period of India.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the Hindu religious sects, only the [[sadhu]]s (monks) of the [[Nāga]] sect can be seen nude.{{sfn|Crooke|1919}} They usually wear a loin-cloth around their waist, but not always; and usually remain in their [[Akhara]] or deep forest or isolation and come out in public only once every four years during [[Kumbh Mela]]. They have a very long history and are warrior monks, who usually also carry a ''[[talwar]]'' ([[sword]]), ''[[trishula|trishul]]'' ([[trident]]), ''bhala'' ([[javelin]]) or such weapons, and in medieval times have fought many wars to protect Hindu temples and shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siddharth|first1=Gautam|title=Nagas: Once were warriors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/Nagas-Once-were-warriors/articleshow/18026313.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times Syndication Service|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===

In the ''[[Digambara]]'' sect of [[Jainism]], monks and nuns are "sky-clad" and the members of this sect also keep their holy statues naked. However, the ''[[Śvētāmbara|Shwetambar]]'' sect is "white-clad" and their holy statues wear a loin cloth.{{sfn|Sharma| Sharma|2004|p=262}}

== New religious movements ==

[[File:Raëlian Women at the Seoul, Korea Love Hug Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|Raelians in South Korea]]

=== Neopaganism ===

In many modern [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] [[religious movement]]s, such as [[Wicca]], social and ritual nudity is (relatively) commonplace. In Wicca, the term [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|''skyclad'']] refers to ritual nudity instead of social nudity.{{sfn|Zimmermann|Gleason|2006|p=77}}

=== Raëlism ===

In [[Raëlism]], nudity is not problematic. Raëlists in North America have formed GoTopless.org, which organizes demonstrations in support of [[topfreedom]] on the basis of the legal and public attitudes to the gender inequality. GoTopless sponsors an annual "[[Go Topless Day]]" protest (also known as "National GoTopless Day", "International Go-Topless Day", etc.) in advocacy for women's right to go topless on gender equality grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moye|first1=David|title=Take Off Your Shirt Everybody! It's Go Topless Day|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/24/go-topless-day-_n_5698006.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5148">'''OTSEM''' (''Old Testament Studies: Epistemologies and Methods'') is a research network of several Northern European universities. Originally Nordic-German in nature, it now includes British universities as well, which gives it a Nordic-German-Anglo profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stenström|authorlink1=Unity and Diversity in Nordic Biblical Scholarship|editor1-last=Boer|editor1-first=Roland|title=The Future of the Biblical Past: Envisioning Biblical Studies on a Global Key|date=2012|publisher=SBL|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization focuses on research into the [[Hebrew Bible]] and promotes the development of young scholars in particular, especially through annual seminars and special lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Together at the OTSEM Meeting in Hamburg {{!}} Changes in Sacred Texts and Traditions|url = http://blogs.helsinki.fi/sacredtexts/2014/09/17/learning-together-at-the-otsem-meeting-in-hamburg/|website = blogs.helsinki.fi|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though encompassing theological faculties and using the term [[Old Testament]], OTSEM is non-confessional, with members from Christian (both Protestant and Catholic), Jewish, Muslim, and secular backgrounds.

==Institutions==

Currently, OTSEM consists of sixteen institutions from eight different countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Institutions|url=http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/204017.html|website=OTSEM Research Network|publisher=University of Göttingen|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Denmark'': [[University of Copenhagen]], [[Aarhus University]]
* ''Estonia'': [[University of Tartu]] (affiliated through Helsinki)
* ''Finland'': [[University of Helsinki]], [[Åbo Akademi University]]
* ''Germany'': [[University of Göttingen]], [[University of Hamburg]]
* ''Iceland'': [[University of Iceland]]
* ''Great Britain'': [[University of Oxford]], [[King's College London]], [[University of Edinburgh]]
* ''Norway'': [[University of Oslo]], [[MF Norwegian School of Theology]], Norwegian School of Mission and Theology
* ''Sweden'': [[Uppsala University]], [[Lund University]]

==History==

The history of OTSEM divides into three distinct periods: Proto-OTSEM, OTSEM I, and OTSEM II (the present iteration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OTSEM History|url=http://www.otsem.uni-hamburg.de/index.php/about-otsem/otsem-history|website=OTSEM|publisher=University of Hamburg|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-OTSEM===

OTSEM's antecedents reach back to the 1970s. At that time, Helsinki and Göttingen had a student and professor exchange between their theological faculties. Beginning in the 1990s, bi- and trilateral doctoral seminars took place among the various institutions that would later become members of OTSEM.

* 1994: Helsinki visited Hamburg (where current Göttingen affiliates previously were)
* 1995: Aarhus visited Hamburg
* 1996: Hamburg visited Aarhus
* 1997: Lund visited Hamburg
* 1998: Hamburg visited Lund
* 2000: Göttingen visited Lund
* 2001: Lund and Oslo visited MF 
* 2002: MF visited Göttingen
* 2003: Lund, Göttingen, and Oslo visited MF

In addition to arranging doctoral seminars, future members also organised professorial exchanges.

* 1995: Hamburg visited Aarhus
* 1998: Lund visited Aarhus
* 1999: Helsinki visited Göttingen; Aarhus visited Lund and MF; Lund visited MF
* 2000: Helsinki visited Göttingen; Göttingen visited Lund; Lund visited MF; MF visited Lund
* 2001: Lund visited MF; Helsinki visited MF

===OTSEM I===

From 2004 through 2008, the Nordic Council (''NordForsk'') co-funded the research network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nordic Research Gems: Success stories from NORIA|date=2008|publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers|pages=26–27|url=http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A707825&amp;dswid=1563|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Granerød|first1=Gard|title=Abraham and Melchizedek: Scribal Activity of Second Temple Times in Genesis 14 and Psalm 110|date=2010|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, OTSEM saw formalization and expansion. This expansion included an increase in not only the number of members and member institutions but also meetings and individual exchanges. In particular, the now formal organization commenced its annual conferences (Oslo in 2004, Göttingen in 2005, Aarhus in 2006, Helsinki in 2008, and Lund in 2008). With the end of funding from the Nordic Council came the end of OTSEM I and start of OTSEM II.

===OTSEM II===

Since 2009, OTSEM has been financed solely by its associated institutions. Nevertheless, the research network has continued its annual conference and individual exchanges.

==Notable members==

OTSEM members with a high international profile have included the following:

*[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]]
*Fredrik Lindström
*[[Reinhard Gregor Kratz]]
*[[Martti Nissinen]]
*[[Hermann Spieckermann]]
*Terje Stordalen

Serious changes in the [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian church]] occurred under the Arab rule, when the Catholicos Nerses I Bakur (688-704) attempted to convert to Chalcedonism, thus recognizing the spiritual authority of [[Constantinople]]. He was deposed by the Grand Duke of Albania Shero and other feudal lords who remained faithful to the Albanian church, and cursed at the national church cathedral. In the second half of the 10th century, the population of the left-bank Albania (Hereti) was included in the sphere of influence of the decision of the Chalcedon Council of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Church]], adopted in the 7th century and got a great impact of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgW_HEcULMYC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=catholicosate+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=catholicosate%20albania&amp;f=false|title=From the Gulf to Central Asia: Players in the New Great Game|last=Ehteshami|first=Anoushiravan|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859894517|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the territories of [[Transcaucasia]] entered the [[Russian Empire]], the Albanian Catholicos of the church in 1813 by the decree of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] passed into the status of the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolite]] of the Albanian church.

Orthodoxy became wide spread in Azerbaijan at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multiculturalism.preslib.az/en_a4.html|title=Azerbaijani Multiculturalism|last=Huseynzadeh|first=Tunjay|website=multiculturalism.preslib.az|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.aliyev-heritage.org/en/7855792.html|title=Welcome to Heydar Aliyevs Heritage Research Center|website=lib.aliyev-heritage.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodoxy in Azerbaijan nowadays ==
In 1815, the first Russian Orthodox church appeared in [[Baku]]. Later such churches were built in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Goranboy (city)|Goranboy]] (Borisi-Russian village, 1842), [[Shamakhi|Shemakha]] (Alty-Aghadj village, 1834), [[Lankaran]] (Vel village, 1838), and [[Gadabay District|Gedabek]] (Slavyanka village, 1844).

There were 21 sectarian villages in Baku during 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_GeneralInfo/_TraditionReligion/_traditionReligion_e.html|title=Azerbaijan - Religion In Azerbaijan|website=www.azerbaijan.az|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the Baku Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. During the Soviet era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/articles/volume33/issue2/BlittBoyd33U.Pa.J.Int'lL.363(2011).pdf|title=Religion in USSR|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authorities repressed the priests of the Baku diocese, but in 1944 two churches were opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://myangle.net/en/angle/899-russian-orthodox-church-baku|title=Russian Orthodox Church in Baku|work=MyAngle|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Baku-Caspian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. On March 22, 2011, the decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church was changed to the Baku-Caspian diocese in Baku-Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mospat.ru/en/2010/12/25/news33364/|title=Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church takes decisions on external church activities {{!}} The Russian Orthodox Church|website=mospat.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 there were six Christian Orthodox churches in the country. Five of them belong to the Russian Orthodox church (ROC): three of them are located in Baku one in Ganja and one in [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]].

Another temple belongs to the jurisdiction of the Georgian Orthodox Church - the church of [[Saint George|St. George]] in the village of Gakh-Inguila in the [[Qakh District|Qakh district]], where the [[Ingiloy people|Ingiloi]] Georgians&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/activity-of-russian-orthodox-church-among-the-muslim-natives-of-the-caucasus-in-imperial-russia/|title=ACTIVITY OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH AMONG THE MUSLIM NATIVES OF THE CAUCASUS IN IMPERIAL RUSSIA|date=2010-08-16|work=მატიანე|access-date=2018-05-31|language=ka-GE}}&lt;/ref&gt; live compactly (about 7,500 people).

In 2013, November, President [[Ilham Aliyev]] participated in the opening ceremony of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy. Firstly&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; The President visited the [[Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/azerbaijani-president-attends-opening-of-orthodox-religious-and-cultural-center-of-baku-and-azerbaijan-eparchy/|title=Azerbaijani President attends opening of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy|date=2013-11-16|work=News {{!}} Orthodoxy Cognate PAGE|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Archangel’s Temple in the capital city Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archangel-mikhail-baku.com/en/about-us/|title=About us – Church of St. Archangel Michael of Baku|website=archangel-mikhail-baku.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Albanian-Udin Christian community ==
In 2001, during his visit to Azerbaijan, Patriarch Alexe II met with representatives of the Udin community who expressed the desire of their people to join the ROC. However, this did not lead to any real results, and the community of Udin remained outside the church's nourishment.

In May 28, 2003, the Albanian-Udin Christian community was established in Azerbaijan. The Chairman of the community was Robert Mobilea. This was due to the restoration of the ancient Kish temple in [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]] (according to legend, the foundation was laid by the apostle Eliseus). In 2006, the restoration of the second Udin temple, the church in the village of Nijgabalinsky district, was completed. Restoration works are also continued in the village of Gum of the Gakh region and the basilica in the village of Gyumriuk with the intention of restoration of the Albanian basilica which is related to the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai113_folder/113_articles/113_udins_konanchev.html|title=Udins Today - Ancestors of the Caucasian Albanians|last=|first=|date=|website=www.azer.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the bishop of Baku and the Caspian Sea, Alexander (Ishchein), reported that Orthodox worship will be performed in Udin churches, and priests for them are trained in Russian religious schools. The Baku diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church took part in some solemn events, and even held baptisms, but there is no general progress on the involving of Udin into the ROC. Meanwhile, the Albanian-Udin Christian community exists in the form of a separate ethno-religious group with its own ideas about the "Udin Church", in which rituals are conducted not by canonical clergymen, but by the members of the community.

H. Chamgon Kenting Tai Situ Rinpoche &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhismus-austria.at/website/output.php?id=1077/ ''European Seat of the Palpung Kongregation of Chamgon Kenting Tai Situ Rinpoche''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122151611/http://www.buddhismus-austria.at/website/output.php?id=1077%2F |date=2015-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established by and is under the direction of [[Gelongma Lama Palmo|Chöje Lama Palmo]]. The City Institute is based in the Viennese Forest in [[Purkersdorf]], the Rural Institute lies in the Bohemian Forest in the border triangle of Austria, Germany and Czech Republique, in [[Langschlag]].

In 1997 [[Pema Tönyö Nyinje|Chamgon Kenting Tai Situ Rinpoche]] bestowed the original name. In 2004, after [[Gelongma Lama Palmo|Chöje Lama Palmo]] had completed her three-year retreat under [[Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche]] in the USA, she was upon the request of individuals sent to Austria by Chamgon Tai Situ Rinpoche. First the center had its house in a rented apartment, until a house in [[Purkersdorf]] was purchased in December 2009 and the farm in [[Langschlag]] in 2014.

The activities are dedicated to preserving the lineage Buddha Shakyamuni's and to bring peace and harmony into the world. H. H. [[Dalai Lama]] and H. H. Karmapa conferred their personal blessing on March 8, 2006. Interreligious exchanges according to the [[Rimé movement]] are an important objective.

The '''Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding''' ('''ACMCU''') is an interfaith institution based at the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Overview==
The institution was founded at [[Georgetown University]] in 1993 as the '''Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding'''. It is housed within the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Caryle Murphy, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/12/AR2005121200591.html Saudi Gives $20 Million to Georgetown], ''Washington Post'' (December 13, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a wealthy Saudi [[House of Saud|Saudi prince]] and businessman, [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]] in 2005, gave $20 million to the Center to promote interfaith understanding and the study of Islam and the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; The center was renamed in his honor.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafferty"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/saudi-prince-gives-gu-20m/ |title= Saudi Prince Gives GU $20M |first= Steve |last= Rafferty |date= January 12, 2006|work= [[The Hoya]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $20 million gift was the second-largest ever given to the Georgetown at that point.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; Bin Talal simultaneously gave $20 million to [[Harvard University]]'s interdisciplinary Islamic studies program and $15 million to establish [[American studies]] programs at the [[American University in Beirut]] and [[American University in Cairo]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

The founding director of the center was [[John Esposito]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=3762 Press Release: Georgetown University Receives $20 Million Gift From Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal To Expand Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904131933/http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=3762 |date=2006-09-04 }}, December 12, 2005.  Accessed 24 November, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito was succeeded by John O. Voll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pluralism.org/profiles/view/74161 Center Profile: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (2005)], Pluralism Project at Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center is co-publisher (with the UK's [[Birmingham University]] Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations) of the journal ''Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17357/ISIM_4_The_Center_for_Muslim-Christian_Understanding-History_and_International_Affairs.pdf?sequence=1 Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001, is a statute passed by the Victorian Parliament during the Premiership of [[Steve Bracks]]. The Act makes behavior that incites or encourages hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group of people because of their race and/or religion unlawful in Victoria

The Act criminalises racist graffiti, racist posters, racist stickers, racist comments made in a publication, including the Internet and email, statements at a meeting or at a public rally. The Act explicitly criminalises public behavior – not personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2001 |title=The Racial and Religious Tolerance Act  |url=https://www.humanrightscommission.vic.gov.au/home/the-law/racial-and-religious-tolerance-act |website=Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission |location=Melbourne |access-date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catch the Fire Ministries - Vilification of Muslims lawsuit==

In a landmark ruling on 17 December 2004, a VCAT tribunal ruled that [[Danny Nalliah]], [[Daniel Scot]] and Catch the Fire Ministries had breached the law. The pair stood accused of making fun of Muslim beliefs and conduct that was "hostile, demeaning and derogatory of all Muslim people, their god, Allah, the prophet Muhammad and in general Muslim religious beliefs and practices". Nalliah publicly condemned the verdict and declared his intention to continue fighting the case, potentially as far as the [[High Court of Australia]]. ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper quoted him as stating, "We may have lost the battle, but the war is not over. The law has to be removed, there is no question."&lt;ref name="TheAgeHistoric"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Historic-win-in-religious-hatred-case/2004/12/17/1102787271940.html Historic win in religious hatred case] [[The Age]], 18 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter was eventually resolved without a VCAT hearing after mediation between the two parties. On 22 June 2007 VCAT published a statement agreed to by both parties which affirmed everyone's rights to "robustly debate religion including the right to criticise the religious belief of another, in a free, open and democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hosen |first1=Nadirsyah |last2=Mohr |first2=Richard |date=2011 |title=Law and religion in public life: The contemporary debate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21963547-1702,00.html |title=Church and Islamic council bury hatchet |last=Turnbull |first=Jeff |date=25 June 2007 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625063604/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21963547-1702,00.html |archivedate=25 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Patriots Front - Inciting Serious Contempt of Muslims==
In September 2017 three prominent members of the far-right [[United Patriots Front]]; Blair Cottrell, Neil Erikson and Chris Shortis, were charged with serious religious vilification, among other offenses. In September that same year they were convicted for inciting serious contempt of Muslims, each were fined $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-05/three-men-found-guilty-of-inciting-serious-contempt-for-muslims/8874804|title=Far-right nationalists found guilty of inciting serious contempt for Muslims|date=2017-09-05|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Former state shadow [[Attorney general]] [[Andrew McIntosh (Australian politician)|Andrew McIntosh]] announced prior to the 2006 election that the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal Party]] would repeal the religious section of the "fundamentally flawed" Act.&lt;ref name="The Age2"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/libs-coy-over-hatred-laws/2006/08/09/1154802962877.html "libs coy over hatred laws"] 9 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2006, nineteen Christian leaders from Melbourne's largest churches wrote to the Premier requesting the removal of the civil provisions in the act, claiming that aspects of the religious vilification law undermines multiculturalism. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/religious-vilification-law-undermines-multiculturalism/2006/04/30/1146335604488.html "religious vilification law undermines multiculturalism"] [[The Age]] 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent MP [[Russell Savage]], whose support helped Bracks form Government in 1999, described the act as "the worst legislation he had ever seen passed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/speaking-freely-is-risky-business-rally-told/2006/08/08/1154802889839.html "speaking freely is risky business"] [[The Age]] 8 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and etymology==
{{See also|Religio}}
''Religion'' (from O.Fr. ''religion'' religious community, from L. ''religionem'' (nom. ''religio'') "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods, sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "obligation, the bond between man and the gods"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) is derived from the Latin ''[[Religio|religiō]]'', the ultimate origins of which are obscure. One possible interpretation traced to [[Cicero]], connects ''{{lang|la|lego}}'' read, i.e. ''re'' (again) with ''lego'' in the sense of choose, go over again or consider carefully. The definition of ''religio'' by [[Cicero]] is ''cultum deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' II, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar used ''religio'' to mean "obligation of an oath" when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caesar |first1=Julius |last2=Translated by |first2=W.A.

In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root ''religio'' was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts; never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature: From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=254|chapter=10.

In the ancient Greece, the Greek term ''threskeia'' was loosely translated into Latin as ''religio'' in late antiquity. The term was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the first century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others; to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word ''deisidaimonia'' which meant too much fear.&lt;ref name="threskeia greece"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=8.

The modern concept of religion, as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines, is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226184487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521892933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt;

Jewish ideologies of Peace and Peacemaking|pages=86-87|quote=Yet despite its ingrained theological tradition, one must acknowledge that the Jewish people did not begin to think of Judaism as a religion until fairly recently. To be clear, the contemporary religious category popularly known as Judaism can be traced back to an ancient Jewish culture traditionally entailing certain fixed ideas about God. That culture also involved unique rites and behaviors related to the worship of God later to be construed as key elements of the Jewish faith. But these cultural effects did not constitute a religion in the formal sense of the word (Nongbri 2013, 46-50). They entailed no compulsory system of belief or regulatory ritual program by which to measure one's Jewish identity. To be a Jew was primarily a matter of national or ethnic identification, a function of being born into a family of Jewish descent or choosing to disavow one's own ancestral culture to become a Jew. By and large, it was not a matter of confession or creed (Satlow 2006, 1-19). It was not until the nineteenth century that Jewish thinkers began to conceive of their ancestral culture in systematized religious terms. Seeking entry into a European civil society dominated by Christian values, many Jews touched by the liberal values of the European Enlightenment undertook to interpret their Judaism in terms analogous to Christianity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term ''ioudaismos'', which some translate as Judaism today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; It was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Burns Jewish" /&gt; The Greek word ''threskeia'', which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the New Testament. ''Threskeia'' is sometimes translated as religion in today's translations, however, the term was understood as worship well into the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300154160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran, the Arabic word ''[[Din (Arabic)|din]]'' is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed ''din'' as law.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; 

The [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as religion, also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]]. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between imperial law and universal or Buddha law, but these later became independent sources of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshio Kuroda|Kuroda, Toshio]] and Jacqueline I.

Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and [[world religions]] first entered the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015|page=101 |quote=The first recorded use of "Boudhism" was 1801, followed by "Hindooism" (1829), "Taouism" (1838), and "Confucianism" (1862) (see figure 6).

This construction of "religions" was not merely the production of European translation terms, but the reification of systems of thought in a way strikingly divorced from their original cultural milieu. The original discovery of religions in different cultures was rooted in the assumption that each people had its own divine "revelation," or at least its own parallel to Christianity. In the same period, however, European and American explorers often suggested that specific African or Native American tribes lacked religion altogether.

But these diverse identities were united, each an integral part of life; no part existed in a separate sphere identified as "religious." Nor were the diverse traditions lumped together under the term "Hinduism" unified by sharing such common features of religion as a single founder, creed, theology, or institutional organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hindu" has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=brian111&gt;{{citation|last=Pennington|first=Brian K.|title=Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7drluePK-acC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803729-3|pages=111–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|title=Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFKBAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42935-6|pages=10–11}}, Quote: "It is often said that Hinduism is very ancient, and in a sense this is true (...).

(...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...)

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]] (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean diligence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history.

Religion is  a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM.  2002).

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A.M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017| citeseerx=10.1.1.613.6995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference US]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010" /&gt;

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0034412504007462|title='Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited|journal=Religious Studies|volume=41|pages=81–94|year=2005|last1=Finlay|first1=Hueston E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"/&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Aspects==

===Beliefs===
{{Main|Religious beliefs}}
Traditionally, [[faith]], in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

====Mythology====
{{Main|Mythology}}
The word ''myth'' has several meanings.
# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 {{ISBN|0-385-24774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called myths in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library {{ISBN|1-57731-202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/myth|title=myth|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[resurrection]] of their real-life founder [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

====Worldview====
Religions have [[sacred history|sacred histories]], [[narrative]]s, and  [[mythology|mythologies]] which may be preserved in sacred [[Religious text|scriptures]], and [[Religious symbol|symbols]] and [[holy places]], that aim to explain the [[meaning of life]], the [[creation myth|origin of life]], or the [[religious cosmology|Universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Practices===
{{Main|Religious behaviour|Cult (religious practice)}}
The practices of a religion may include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration (of a [[deity]], [[God (male deity)|gods]], or [[goddess]]es), [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]]s, [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[religious music]], [[religious art]], [[sacred dance]], [[Community service|public service]], or other aspects of human culture.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social organisation===
Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized [[clergy]], and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.

==Academic study==
{{Main|Religious studies|Classifications of religious movements}}
A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: [[theology]], [[comparative religion]], [[history of religion]], [[evolutionary origin of religions]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[psychology of religion]] (including [[neurotheology|neuroscience of religion]] and [[evolutionary psychology of religion]]), [[law and religion]], and [[sociology of religion]].

Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: [[animism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], by [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[J.G. Frazer]]; the [[Psychoanalysis|psycho-analytic]] approach of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and further [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], and [[Clifford Geertz]].{{sfn|Pals|2006}}

[[Michael Stausberg]] gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including [[Cognitive science of religion|cognitive]] and biological approaches.{{sfn|Stausberg|2009}}

===Theories===
{{Main|Theories of religion}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] theories of religion generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

====Origins and development====
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Yazılıkaya]] sanctuary in [[Turkey]], with the twelve gods of the underworld]]
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.

According to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Cultural system====
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category".&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Niebuhr's (1894–1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Niebuhr, ''Christ and Culture'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1951) as cited by Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social constructionism====
{{Main|Theories about religions#Social constructionism|l1=Social constructionism}}
One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.&lt;ref name="vergote 89"&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald,  Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

====Cognitive science====
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion}}

Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[neurobiology]], [[zoology]], and [[ethology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

Hallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with [[schizophrenia]]. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomenon and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=PT|title=Psychosis and paroxysmal visions in the lives of the founders of world religions.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=26|issue=1|date=2014|pages=E13–14|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12120412|pmid=24515692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=ED|last2=Cunningham|first2=MG|last3=Price|first3=BH|title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=24|issue=4|date=2012|pages=410–426|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214|pmid=23224447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=SR|last2=Pargament|first2=KI|title=The role of religion and spirituality in mental health.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=September 2014|volume=27|issue=5|pages=358–363|doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080|pmid=25046080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reina|first1=Aaron|title=Faith Within Atheism|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=July 2014|volume=40|issue=4|pages=719–720|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt076|pmid=23760918|pmc=4059423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious content is also common in [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favazza|first1=A|editor1-last=Sadock|editor1-first=B|editor2-last=Sadock|editor2-first=V|editor3-last=Ruiz|editor3-first=P|title=Kaplan and Sadocks Comprehensive Texbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|edition=10th|chapter=Psychiatry and Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschuler|first1=EL|title=Temporal lobe epilepsy in the preistly source of the Pentateuch|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=2004|volume=11|issue=94|page=870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparativism===
{{Main|Comparative religion}}
Comparative religion is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main||History of religions}}
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of [[List of religious populations|major denominations and religions of the world]]]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:
# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], [[international]] religions
# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed religions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?''

Cambridge University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-521-56635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bulbulia. "Are There Any Religions? An Evolutionary Explanation." ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.2 (2005), pp. 71–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological classification===
Some scholars classify religions as either ''[[Universalizing religion|universal religions]]'' that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ''[[ethnic religion]]s'' that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33311-5 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald.

===Demographical classification===
{{Main|Major religious groups|List of religious populations}}
The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of [[syncretism]]) and traditional folk religion.

==Specific religions==
{{Mainarticle|List of religions and spiritual traditions}}

===Abrahamic===
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|upright|thumb|The patriarch [[Abraham]] (by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]])]]
[[Abrahamic religions]] are [[monotheistic]] religions which believe they descend from [[Abraham]].

====Judaism====
[[File:Open Torah and pointer.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Torah]] is the primary sacred text of Judaism.]]
[[Judaism]] is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel and Judea]]. The [[Torah]] is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]]. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]]; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The [[Jewish people]] were scattered after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cbs.gov.il |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

====Christianity====
[[File:StJohnsAshfield StainedGlass GoodShepherd Portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity.]]
[[Christianity]] is based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (1st century) as presented in the [[New Testament]]. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the [[Christ]], the [[Son of God]], and as [[Messiah|Savior]] and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the [[Trinity]], which teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] (Jesus Christ), and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]]. Most Christians can describe their faith with the [[Nicene Creed]]. As the religion of [[Byzantine Empire]] in the first millennium and of [[Western Europe]] during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
* The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Bishop of Rome]] and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of 24 Churches ''[[sui iuris]]'', including the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]], such as the [[Maronite]] Catholic Church.
* [[Eastern Christianity]], which include [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]].
* [[Protestantism]], separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] and is split into thousands of [[Religious denomination|denominations]].  Major branches of Protestantism include [[Anglicanism]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Methodism]], though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.

There are also smaller groups, including:
* [[Restorationism]], the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic early church]].
* [[Latter Day Saint movement]], founded by [[Joseph Smith]] in the late 1820s.
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]].

====Islam====
[[File:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Muslim]]s [[Tawaf|circumambulating]] the [[Kaaba]], the most sacred site in [[Islam]]]]
[[Islam]] is based on the [[Quran]], one of the [[Islamic holy books|holy books]] considered by Muslims to be [[Wahy|revealed]] by [[God in Islam|God]], and on the [[Hadith|teachings (hadith)]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before [[Muhammad]]. It is the most widely practiced religion of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of [[South Asia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Europe]]. There are also several [[Islamic republic]]s, including [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Afghanistan]].
* [[Sunni Islam]] is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Quran, the hadiths which record the [[sunnah]], whilst placing emphasis on the [[sahabah]].
* [[Shia Islam]] is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that [[Ali]] succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.
* [[Ahmadiyya]] adherents believe that the awaited Imam [[Mahdi]] and the Promised Messiah has arrived, believed to be [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] by Ahmadis.
* There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].

Other denominations of Islam include [[Nation of Islam]], [[Ibadi]], [[Sufism]], [[Quranism]], [[Mahdavia]], and [[non-denominational Muslims]]. [[Wahhabism]] is the dominant Muslim [[Maddhab|schools of thought]] in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].

====Other====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th-century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. One of its divisions is the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]].

Smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including [[Samaritanism]] (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the [[Rastafari movement]] (primarily in Jamaica), and [[Druze]] (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

===East Asian===
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Dō (in Japanese or Korean). They include:

====Taoism and Confucianism====
* [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.

====Chinese folk religion====
* [[Chinese folk religion]]: the indigenous religions of the [[Han Chinese]], or, by [[metonymy]], of all the populations of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. It includes the syncretism of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Wuism]], as well as many new religious movements such as [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]], [[Falun Gong]] and [[Yiguandao]].
* Other folk and new religions of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] such as [[Korean shamanism]], [[Chondogyo]], and [[Jeung San Do]] in Korea; [[Shinto]], [[Shugendo]], [[Ryukyuan religion]], and [[Japanese new religions]] in Japan; [[Satsana Phi]] in Laos; [[Cao Đài]], [[Hòa Hảo]], and [[Vietnamese folk religion]] in Vietnam.

[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Buddha]], in a [[Sanskrit]] manuscript, [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], Bihar, India]]
[[Indian religions]] are practiced or were founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They are sometimes classified as the ''dharmic religions'', as they all feature [[dharma]], the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mittal |first=Sushil |title=Surprising Bedfellows: Hindus and Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern India |year=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739106730 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
* [[Hinduism]] is preferentially self-designated by the term ''Vaidika Dharma''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC|date=2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3| page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[synecdoche]] describing the similar philosophies of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Hindu denominations|related groups]] practiced or founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Concepts most of them share in common include [[karma]], [[caste]], [[reincarnation]], [[mantra]]s, [[yantra]]s, and [[darśana]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hinduism is variously defined as a religion, set of religious beliefs and practices, religious tradition etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: "Establishing the boundaries" in Gavin Flood (2003), pp. 1–17. [[René Guénon]] in his'' [[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' (1921 ed.), Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|0-900588-74-8}}, proposes a definition of the term religion and a discussion of its relevance (or lack of) to Hindu doctrines (part II, chapter 4, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religions,&lt;ref&gt;p. 434 ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' By Wendy Doniger, M. Webster, Merriam-Webster, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 219 ''Faith, Religion &amp; Theology'' By Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges&lt;/ref&gt; with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 ''The World's Great Religions'' By Yoshiaki Gurney Omura, Selwyn Gurney Champion, Dorothy Short&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as [[Sanātana Dharma]], which is the name by which Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.

====Jainism====
* [[Jainism]], taught primarily by [[Rishabhanatha]] (the founder of [[ahimsa]]) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of [[non-violence]], [[truth]] and [[anekantavada]] for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the [[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]], and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving ([[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]]). Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the [[Mahavira]] as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}
** [[Digambara]] Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are [[Pravachanasara]] and [[Samayasara]] written by their Prophets  [[Kundakunda]] and [[Amritchandra]] as their [[Jain Agamas (Digambara)|original cannon]] is lost.
** [[Shwetambara]] Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are [[Jain Agamas]], written by their Prophet [[Sthulibhadra]].

====Buddhism====
* [[Buddhism]] was founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end their [[dukkha|suffering (dukkha)]] by understanding the [[dharma|true nature of phenomena]], thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].
** [[Theravada]] Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the [[Pali Canon]].
** [[Mahayana]] Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent [[Buddhism in China|in China]] and are still relevant [[Buddhism in Vietnam|in Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and to a lesser extent [[Buddhism in the West|in Europe and the United States]]. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as [[Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], and [[Soka Gakkai]].
** [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony (2000), Buddhist Thought: A complete introduction to the Indian tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-18593-5}} p=194&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E. Gene (2001). Among Tibetan Texts: History and Literature of the Himalayan Plateau.

[[Mikkyō]]).
** Two notable new Buddhist sects are [[Hòa Hảo]] and the [[Navayana]] ([[Dalit Buddhist movement]]), which were developed separately in the 20th century.

It is the [[Major religious groups|fifth-largest]] [[organized religion]] in the world, with approximately 30 million Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sikhism: What do you know about it?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/sikhism-what-do-you-know-about-it/2012/08/06/19131ef6-dff1-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_gallery.html|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zepps |first=Josh |title=Sikhs in America: What You Need To Know About The World's Fifth-Largest Religion |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/06/sikhs-in-america_n_1748125.html |accessdate=13 December 2012 |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sikh]]s are expected to embody the qualities of a ''Sant-Sipāhī'' – a saint-soldier, have control over one's internal [[Five Thieves|vices]] and be able to be constantly immersed in virtues clarified in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in ''[[Waheguru]]''—represented by the phrase ''[[ik Onkar|ik ōaṅkār]]'', meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

===Science===
{{Main|Faith and rationality|Relationship between religion and science|Epistemology}}
[[Science]] acknowledges [[reason]], [[empiricism]], and [[evidence]]; and religions include [[revelation]], [[faith]] and [[sacredness]] whilst also acknowledging [[Philosophy of religion|philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stenmark |first1=Mikael |title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model |date=2004 |publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co. |location=Grand Rapids, Mich. |isbn=978-0802828231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri/&gt; The term science emerged in the 19th century out of [[natural philosophy]] in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature ([[natural science]]),&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226482149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"/&gt; It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

In general the [[scientific method]] gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop [[theories]] through elucidation of facts or evaluation by [[experiment]]s and thus only answers [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] questions about the [[universe]] that can be observed and measured. It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as ''[[de facto]]'' verities in general parlance, such as the theories of [[general relativity]] and [[natural selection]] to explain respectively the mechanisms of [[gravity]] and [[evolution]].

Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tolman |first1=Cynthia |title=Methods in Religion |url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |website=Malboro College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion and science, [[Albert Einstein]] states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal God Concept Causes Science-Religion Conflict |journal=The Science News-Letter |date=21 September 1940 |first=Albert |last=Einstein |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=181–182 |jstor=3916567 |doi=10.2307/3916567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
{{Main|Morality and religion}}
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Jems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Theological Aspects of the Avesta|Zoroastrianism's]] good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|last=Esptein|first=Greg M.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-167011-4|edition=|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and morality are not synonymous. While it is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements of Moral Philosophy|last2=Rachels|first2=(ed) Stuart|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-078-03824-2|edition=7|location=New York|page=|last1=Rachels|first1=(ed) James}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Christianity, morality can have a [[Secular morality|secular basis]].

The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.

=== Politics ===
====Impact====
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of [[sharia]], the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57&amp;nbsp;billion people who are [[Muslim world|Muslims]]. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the [[United States]], 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-18?cid1=cust/noenew/n/n/n/20160229n/owned/n/n/nwl/n/n/NA/email The Economist explains: The role of religion in America’s presidential race], ''The Economist'', 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress ([[Kyrsten Sinema]], D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/27/10-facts-about-religion-in-america/|title=10 facts about religion in America|last=Lipka|first=Michael|date=27 Aug 2015|website=|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/04/europe-religion-and-politics Europe, religion and politics:Old world wars], The Economist, 22 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; although it used to be much more important. For instance, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually [[Catholicism|Catholic]]) doctrine. Several [[List of atheists in politics and law|European leaders are atheists]] (e.g. [[France]]’s former president [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]] or Greece's prime minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, [[India]] is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;Lobo, L. 2000 [http://americamagazine.org/issue/276/article/religion-and-politics-india Religion and Politics in India], ''America Magazine'', 19 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, countries such as [[Religion in China|China]] or [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.

====Secularism====
[[File:Ranjitsingh.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ranjit Singh]] established [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] over [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the early 19th century.]]

{{Main|Secularism| Secularization}}
Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the populations religious diversity.

===Economics===
[[File:Religion economy.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Average income correlates negatively with (self-defined) religiosity.&lt;ref name="gia" /&gt;]]
{{Main|Economics of religion}}
{{Further|Religion and business|Wealth and religion}}
One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web |last=WIN-Gallup |title=Global Index of religion and atheism. |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).&lt;ref name="WIN-Gallup" /&gt;

Sociologist and political economist [[Max Weber]] has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their [[Protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, [1904] 1920. ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study from 2015, [[Christians]] hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by [[Muslims]] (5.8%), [[Hindus]] (3.3%) and [[Jewish]] (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification [[Irreligion]] or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/453467/christians-hold-largest-percentage-global.html6 |title=Christians hold largest percentage of global wealth: Report|publisher=deccanherald.com|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Impacts of religion on health}}
[[Mayo Clinic]] researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."&lt;ref name="Religion and Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul S. |last1=Mueller, MD |first2=David J. |last2=Plevak, MD |first3=Teresa A. |last3=Rummans, MD |title=Religious Involvement, Spirituality, and Medicine: Implications for Clinical Practice |url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0025-6196/PIIS0025619611627997.pdf |quote=We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes.

The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hill |first2=Peter C. |title=The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=February 2001 |first=Kevin S. |last=Seybold |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Religion, Health, and the Psychology of Religion: How the Research on Religion and Health Helps Us Understand Religion |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |year=2004 |first=James W. |last=Jones |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4299-3|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/bilimname/issue/3501/47580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.008|pmid=16359765|title=Gender differences in religious practices, spiritual experiences and health: Results from the US General Social Survey|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=62|issue=11|pages=2848–2860|year=2006|last1=Maselko|first1=Joanna|last2=Kubzansky|first2=Laura D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics like [[Hector Avalos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regina Schwartz]],&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2007"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=God is not Great |publisher=Twelve |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref name="Dawkins 2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that "virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
Done by some (but not all) religions, [[animal sacrifice]] is the [[ritual]] killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a [[deity]]. It has been banned in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/india-court-bans-animal-sacrifice-hindu-temples |title=Indian court bans animal sacrifice |last=France-Presse |first=Agence|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2014-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superstition ===
{{Further|Superstition|Magical thinking|Magic and religion}}
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (''deisidaimonia''), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne 1987, p. 211 {{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] described superstition in [[Ancient Rome]] as an ''[[instrumentum regni]]'', an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]], VI 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superstition has been described as the non rational establishment of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf Kevin R. Foster and Hanna Kokko, "The evolution of superstitious and superstition-like behaviour", ''Proc. R. Soc.

Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Religion Explained |last=Boyer | first = Pascal |year=2001 |chapter=Why Belief |authorlink=Pascal Boyer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wreF80OHTicC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22fang+too+were+quite+amazed%22|title-link=Religion Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nailed : ten Christian myths that show Jesus never existed at all|last=David|first=Fitzgerald|isbn=9780557709915|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=701249439|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[atheists]], [[deists]], and [[skeptics]] regard religious belief as superstition.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110).  "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16–22" (para. #2111)

===Agnosticism and atheism===
{{Main|Atheism|Agnosticism|Irreligion|Antireligion|Humanism}}
{{See also|Criticism of atheism}}
The terms [[atheist]] (lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.

===Interfaith cooperation===
{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}, many religious practitioners{{who|date=July 2016}} have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]]. The first major dialogue was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Culture===
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. [[Paul Tillich]] looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Queen, ''
Encyclopedia of American Religious History, Volume 1'' Facts on File, 1996. p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', Robert C. Kimball (ed), (Oxford University Press, 1959). p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ernst Troeltsch]], similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. &lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Sharpe, "Religion and Cultures", An inaugural lecture delivered on 6 July, 1977 by Eric J. Sharpe, Professor of Religious Studies in the University of Sydney. Accessed at [https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/ART/article/download/5496/6167 Openjournals] on June 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Taslima Nasreen, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/i-say-three-cheers-for-ayaan/232289 "I Say, Three Cheers For Ayaan",] ''Outlook, The Magazine'' 28 August 2006. Also, Nemani Delaibatiki, [http://fijisun.com.fj/2017/07/08/religion-and-the-vanua/ "Religion and the Vanua"] ''Fiji Sun'' July 08, 2017 in which the distinctive elements of culture against religion are taken from Domenic Marbaniang, [https://philpapers.org/bbs/thread.pl?tId=959 "Difference Between Culture and Religion: A Proposal Requesting Response"], 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[religions|religious traditions]] have taken a stance on [[abortion]], and these stances span a broad spectrum, as highlighted below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/religion/religion.shtml BBC "Religion and Ethics"] Be aware that these BBC pages do not cover all Protestant, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist beliefs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html Patheos Public Square Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005014915/http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html |date=2011-10-05 }} Including Buddhist, Muslim, Mormon, and Pagan perspectives in addition to Catholic, Evangelical, Protestant, and Jewish perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
Abortion, for the purpose of eliminating an unwanted child, and permanent sterilization are generally forbidden to [[Bahá'ís]] unless there is some medical reason for it. At present, Bahá'ís are encouraged to decide based on their own conscience in light of general guidance found in Bahá'í writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Bahá'u'lláh | author2 =Abdu'l-Bahá |author3=Shoghi Effendi |author4=Universal House of Justice |editor-last =Hornby| editor-first = Helen| title =Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File | publisher =New Delhi: Bahá'í Publishing Trust | year =1983 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html&amp;chapter=2#n1154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{main article|Buddhism and abortion}}
There is no single [[Buddhist]] view concerning abortion.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Abortion: Buddhism]." ''BBC Religion &amp; Ethics.'' Retrieved January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditional sources, including some Buddhist monastic codes, hold that life begins at conception, and that abortion, which would then involve the deliberate destruction of life, should be rejected.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey, Peter. Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (2000). Cambridge University Press. pg. 311–20&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating the issue is the Buddhist belief that "life is a continuum with no discernible starting point".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html Buddhism and Abortion on Patheos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301172029/http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html |date=2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Buddhists, there is no official or preferred viewpoint regarding abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Buddhism and abortion on BBC Religions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is "negative", but there are exceptions. He said, "I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |work=New York Times |date= 28 November 1993 |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |title= New York Times Interview with the Dalai Lama |accessdate= 31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inducing or otherwise causing an abortion is regarded as a serious matter in the monastic rules followed by both [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] monks; monks and nuns must be expelled for assisting a woman in procuring an abortion.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; Traditional sources do not recognize a distinction between early- and late-term abortion, but in Sri Lanka and Thailand the "moral stigma" associated with an abortion grows with the development of the foetus.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; While traditional sources do not seem to be aware of the possibility of abortion as relevant to the health of the mother, modern Buddhist teachers from many traditions&amp;nbsp;– and abortion laws in many Buddhist countries&amp;nbsp;– recognize a threat to the life or physical health of the mother as an acceptable justification for abortion as a practical matter, though it may still be seen as a deed with negative moral or karmic consequences.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

== Christianity ==
{{main article|Abortion and Christianity|Catholic Church and abortion}}
There is scholarly disagreement on how early Christians felt about abortion, and no explicit prohibition of abortion in either the "Old Testament" or "New Testament" books of the [[Christian Bible]]. Some scholars have concluded that early Christians took a nuanced stance on what is now called abortion, and that at different times, and in separate places, early Christians have taken different stances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBN6r3cC6v0C&amp;pg=PA110 When Children Became People: the birth of childhood in early Christianity] by Odd Magne Bakke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm "Abortion and Catholic Thought: The Little-Told History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218195040/http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm |date=2012-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=universityofcalifornia&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-SZnZTSQV9EC&amp;pg=PA12 Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood] by Kristin Luker, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; although there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was&lt;ref name="prejudices"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VXGkAhyNGAEC&amp;pg=PA166 Ana S.

Early church councils punished women for abortions that were combined with other sexual crimes, as well as makers of abortifacient drugs,&lt;ref name="universityofcalifornia"/&gt; but, like some early Church Fathers such as [[Basil of Caesarea]], did not make distinction between "formed" and "unformed" foetuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4__yBKLGRngC M.

Contemporary [[Christian denomination]]s have nuanced positions, thoughts, and teachings about abortion, especially in extenuating circumstances.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 "Religious Groups’ Official Positions on Abortion"] Pew Forum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=where&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm "Where does God stand on abortion?"] USA Today&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp |title=Abortion |work=Catholic Answers |publisher=Catholic.com |date=2004-08-10 |accessdate=2011-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903232336/http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicapologetics.info/morality/abortion/abortion.htm The Catholic Teaching on Abortion], ''Allocution to Large Families, Nov. 26, 1951'', [[Pope Pius XII]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serborth.org/01222009.html |title=The Orthodox Perspective on Abortion at the occasion of the National Sanctity of Human Life Day 2009 |first=Vasilije |last=Vranic |publisher=Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America |date=January 2009 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7101 |title=The Stand of the Orthodox Church on Controversial Issues |work=Our Faith |first=Stanley S. |last=Harakas |publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and most [[Evangelical|evangelical Protestants]] oppose deliberate abortion as immoral, while allowing what is sometimes called indirect abortion, namely, an action that does not seek the death of the foetus as an end or a means, but that is followed by the death as a side effect.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Robert Kaczor, ''The Ethics of Abortion'' (Taylor &amp; Francis 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-415-88468-6}}), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[mainline Protestant]] denominations such as the [[Methodist Church]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcusa.org/resource/problem-pregnancies-and-abortion/|title=Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) - Resources - Problem Pregnancies and Abortion|last=(U.S.A.)|first=Presbyterian Church|date=2012-01-11|website=www.pcusa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]], among others, are more permissive of abortion.

Additionally, there are sizable minorities in some denominations that disagree with their denomination's stance on abortion.&lt;ref name=where /&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Main article|Hinduism and abortion}}
Classical Hindu texts strongly condemn abortion. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] writes, "When considering abortion, the Hindu way is to choose the action that will do least harm to all involved: the mother and father, the foetus and society." The BBC goes on to state, "In practice, however, abortion is practiced in Hindu culture in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to [[Sex-selective abortion|abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies]], which is called 'female foeticide'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC] "Hinduism and abortion"&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions. Some Hindus support abortion in cases where the mother's life is at imminent risk or when the foetus has a life-threatening developmental anomaly.

Some Hindu theologians and [[Brahma Kumaris]] believe personhood begins at three months and develops through to five months of gestation, possibly implying permitting abortion up to the third month and considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul's current incarnate body.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1: Dilemmas of Life and Death: Hindu Ethics in a North American Context | Date: 1995 | Author: Crawford, S.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Islam and abortion}}
Although there are different opinions among Islamic scholars about when life begins, and when abortion is permissible, most agree that the termination of a pregnancy after 120 days - the point at which, in Islam, a foetus is thought to become a living soul - is not permissible.&lt;ref name=PewForum&gt;The Pew Forum. September 30, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 ''Religious Groups’ Official Positions on Abortion''], Retrieved on April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.&lt;ref name=PewForum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools of [[Sharia|Muslim law]] permit abortion in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, whereas others only allow it in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. The further along the pregnancy has progressed, the greater the wrong. The Qur'an does not specifically mention abortion, but it skirts the issue by condemning intentional murder. All schools accept abortion as a means to save the mother's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - Religions - Islam: Abortion|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
{{main article|Judaism and abortion}}
Orthodox Jewish teaching allows abortion if necessary to safeguard the life of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml Judaism and Abortion], BBC (2005-02-08).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bank, Richard.

In Judaism, views on abortion draw primarily upon the legal and ethical teachings of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Talmud]], the case-by-case decisions of [[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]], and other rabbinic literature. Generally speaking, Orthodox Jews oppose abortion after the 40th day,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Yevomot 69a states that prior to the 40th day, a foetus is "considered to be mere water"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grodzenski, Achiezer Vol. 3, 65:14&lt;/ref&gt; with health-related exceptions, and reform Jews tend to allow greater latitude for abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Articles published by the [[Schlesinger institute]] on [[Judaism and abortion|abortion in Judaism]]: articles [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/jmeResults.asp?title=abortion&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in English] and [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/AsiaResults.asp?title=&amp;keywords=20&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in Hebrew], and the [http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/tora/subject18.asp entry on abortion] from the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; There are rulings that often appear conflicting on the matter. The Talmud states that a foetus is not legally a person until it is delivered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Getting-off-the-Bus.html Jewish Abortion perspective 1 on Patheos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413033311/http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Getting-off-the-Bus.html |date=2010-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah contains the law that, "When men fight, and one of them pushes a pregnant woman, and a miscarriage results, but no other misfortune, the one responsible shall be fined...but if other misfortune ensues, the penalty shall be life (nefesh) for life (nefesh)." ({{bibleverse||Exodus|21:22-25|HE}}).

'''The Elements of Moral Philosophy.''' Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew Bible has a few references to abortion; Exodus 21:22-25 addresses [[miscarriage]] by way of another's actions, which it describes as a non-capital offense punishable through a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|21:22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isser, Stanley. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43718023 Two Traditions: The Law of Exodus 21:22-23 Revisited], ''Catholic Biblical Quarterly''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Numbers]] in the Hebrew Bible describes the [[Ordeal of the bitter water]] (''sotah'') to be administered by a priest to a wife whose husband thinks she was unfaithful.

==Sikhism==
Although the [[Sikh]] code of conduct does not deal directly with abortion (or indeed many other bioethical issues), it is generally forbidden in Sikhism because it is said to interfere with the creative work of God.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this theoretical viewpoint, abortion is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India, and there is growing concern that [[Sex-selective abortion|female foetuses are being aborted]] because of the cultural preference for sons.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Unitarian Universalism==
The [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] strongly supports abortion rights. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution that declared, "...&lt;nowiki&gt;[the]&lt;/nowiki&gt; right to choice on contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of privacy, respect for human life, and freedom of conscience of women and their families".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml Right to Choose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904064958/http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml |date=2009-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association had released earlier statements in 1963 and 1968 favoring the reform of restrictive abortion laws.

==Wicca==
Although views differ, most Wiccans consider abortion to be a spiritual decision that should be free from interference by the state or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of women and religion in North America: Volume 1 - Page 811, Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

(1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists of religion have performed multiple studies to measure the positive and negative effects of this coping style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trevino | first1 = K.

Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of religious coping==
[[Kenneth Pargament]] is the author of the book ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping]]'' and a leading researcher in religious coping. Along with developing the "RCOPE" questionnaire to measure religious coping strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = Kenneth I. | last2 = Koenig | first2 = Harold G. | last3 = Perez | first3 = Lisa M. | year = 2000 | title = The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 519–543 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 | pmid = 10775045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pargament and his colleagues designated three basic styles of coping with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament, Joseph Kennell, William Hathaway, Nancy Grevengoed, Jon Newman &amp; Wendy Jones (1988). Religion and the problem-solving process: Three styles of coping. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, v27 n1, pp90-104. ISSN 0021-8294&lt;/ref&gt; In Pargament's article "Religion and the Problem-Solving Process: Three Styles of Coping", he identifies the collaborative, self-directed, and deferring coping styles. The collaborative style of religious coping involves an active and internalized personal exchange with God. The deferring coping style is when individuals rely heavily on God and delegate their stress without taking personal responsibility for the situation. The self-directed style of religious coping emphasizes the free will given by God that allows for the individual to solve the problem on their own. The collaborative style of coping has been found to produce the most advantages in clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = III | last2 = Lynn | first2 = Q. K. | last3 = Crossley | first3 = C. D. | last4 = Pargament | first4 = K.

In a meta-analysis of 49 studies reviewing religion as a coping method, several mechanisms of positive coping were identified. Several are listed below.
* religious purification/forgiveness
* religious direction/conversion
* seeking support from clergy members
* spiritual connection
In the same study, negative coping strategies were also pinpointed. Some of them are listed below.
* spiritual discontent
* punishing God reappraisal
* reappraisal of God's powers
* pleading for direct intercession
The study then identified forms of positive psychological adjustment, like those listed below.
* acceptance
* happiness
* optimism
* purpose in life
A similar list of negative psychological adjustments was compiled.
* anxiety
* burden
* negative mood
* callousness
Positive religious coping methods correlated more strongly with positive psychological adjustment than negative psychological adjustment. Similarly, negative religious coping methods correlated with negative psychological adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–80|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific traumatic events==

===September 11 attacks===
The [[September 11 attacks]] have been widely studied among psychologists. Research has shown that 90% of Americans coped with the stress of September 11 (2001) by "turning to religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Harold G|title=Research on Religion, Spirituality, and Mental Health: A Review|journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=54|issue=5|pages=283–291|doi=10.1177/070674370905400502|pmid=19497160|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-two percent of a sample of undergraduate and graduate students reported praying to cope with the stress that followed the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = BD | last2 = Elliott | first2 = MN | last3 = Jaycox | first3 = LH | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = A national longitudinal study of the psychological consequences of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks: reactions, impairment, and help-seeking | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 105–117 | doi=10.1521/psyc.67.2.105.35964| pmid = 15262576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis showed that searching for spiritual meaning was associated with less anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Cascio | first2 = T | last3 = Santangelo | first3 = LK | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Hope, meaning, and growth following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks | url = | journal = J Interpers Violence | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 523–548 | doi=10.1177/0886260504272896| pmid = 15788553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists also examined the types of coping used and how they affected mental health outcomes. Research shows that people who used positive religious coping displayed greater optimism, less anxiety, and higher levels of positive emotion three months after the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Tice | first2 = TN | last3 = Peterson | first3 = C | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Prayers, spiritual support, and positive attitudes in coping with the September 11 national crisis | url = | journal = J Pers | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 763–791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00328.x| pmid = 15854013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who used positive religious coping were found to have significantly more positive outcomes (closeness with God, relationships with family and friends) than those who used negative religious coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = KI | last2 = Ishler | first2 = K | last3 = Dubow | first3 = EF | display-authors = etal | year = 1994 | title = Methods of religious coping with the Gulf War: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses | url = | journal = J Sci Study Relig | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 347–361 | doi=10.2307/1386494| jstor = 1386494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Muslims were another highly studied group after the attacks. Results in this area align with previous research, showing that positive religious coping is associated with posttraumatic growth, while negative religious coping predicted higher levels of depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abu-Raiya | first1 = H. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K.

===Death of a loved one===

Individuals deal with the death of significant people in their lives in a variety of ways. One of the most common ways that Americans deal with the death of a loved one is by turning to religion. Although most psychologists would argue that religious coping leads to positive outcomes, some research identifies that coping using religious can lead to greater amounts of distress, especially in dealing with the loss of a family member due to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Vardaman | first2 = P. J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of religion in coping with the loss of a family member to homicide | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 44–51 | doi = 10.2307/1387881 | jstor = 1387881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research recognized that the role of attachment to God is very important in determining how successful religious coping will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ungureanu | first1 = I. | last2 = Sandberg | first2 = J. G. | year = 2010 | title = Broken together": Spirituality and religion as coping strategies for couples dealing with the death of a child: A literature review with clinical implications | url = | journal = Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 302–319 | doi = 10.1007/s10591-010-9120-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that secure attachment to God and a positive religious coping style is positively correlated with stress related growth, positive religious outcomes, and a developed sense of meaning. Anxious and avoidant attachments to God and negative religious coping styles were positively correlated with depression, traumatic distress, and separation distress. Furthermore, attachment to God was strongly more correlated to positive outcomes than attachment to others.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, M. M. (2003, April). Bereavement and grief related to a significant death: A psychological and theological study of attachment styles and religious coping. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A, 63,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-death experiences===

[[Near-death experiences]] (NDEs) provide a unique opportunity for psychologists to study the way in which people cope with their own death. NDEs generally trigger an out-of-body experience into a realm populated with spiritual beings and have the potential to shape American attitudes toward death in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwilecki | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Religion and Coping: A Contribution from Religious Studies | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 477–489 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00250.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys show that five percent of Americans have a NDE, which presents a limited field to study.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L. W. and J. Yates. (1996.) Introduction. In the near-death experience: A reader, edited by L. W. Bailey and J. Yates, pp. 1–23. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, people who have NDEs report positive outcomes including reduced anxiety, increased capacity to love, and a higher sense of meaning and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Atwater, P. M. H. (1994). Beyond the light: The mysteries and revelations of near-death experiences. New York: Avon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have NDEs often fall into Pargament's category of transformative coping. In these cases, the person is transformed into a whole new way of life and way of thinking by one supernatural experience.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using religious coping in school and work ==

=== MindUP Initiative ===
Twelve years ago Goldie Hawn founded MindUP: a mindfulness based initiative to help students in schools deal with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, E. (2015, Feb 17). Can 'mindfulness' help students do better in school? advocates say the meditation technique raises focus and lowers stress. critics see religion in disguise. Wall Street Journal (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; The program has since been implemented in schools in 28 states, and has locations in Canada, China, Serbia, Australia, and Venezuela. The program invites students to participate in 15 lessons based on neuroscience. Kimberly Schonert-Reichl an employee of MindsUP and of the University of British Columbia evaluated the effectiveness of MindUP on students grades 4 through 5. Her findings are shown below:

* 82% of children reported having a more positive outlook
* 81% of children learned to make themselves happy
* 58% of children tried to help others more often

Even though MindUP has had very positive effects skeptics call it religion in disguise. They claim that the mindfulness exercises such as "belly breaths" are [[Buddhist]] practices as a different name. In some states MindUP has been removed from schools because schools are supposed to be secular and non-religious.

===Religion as buffer in the workplace===
A study was conducted by Dr Roxane Gervais, a senior psychologist at the Health and Safety Laboratory in Stockport.&lt;ref&gt;Religion forms buffer against work stress. (2014, Jan 09). Telegraph.Co.Uk&lt;/ref&gt; She found that people who were more actively religious were more likely to report low levels of anxiety, depression and fatigue and also felt a higher presence of meaning in life. These people also took less sick days. She concluded that employers should accommodate time for employees to engage in religious beliefs while at work in order to improve performance.

==Religious coping in clinical settings==
Despite the problems encountered when studying religion as a coping mechanism, much research suggests that using it in intervention settings when applicable may be beneficial. For example, according to a study be Wachholtz and Pargament, when identified religious people suffering from splitting migraines were exposed to meditations with religious or non-religious content, they reported less pain after the religious meditations. Such "psychospiritual" methods have been utilized for a while, although their applications are limited and specific from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion vs. spirituality==
Research in the psychology of religion often reveals different outcomes between [[religion]] and [[spirituality]]. A person's religion is a collection of belief systems and moral values, often established by a governing institution. Religion is generally more traditional, organized, and sociological. Religion is considered to be more formal and upheld than spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality, on the other hand, is a measure of one's intrinsic relationship with their God. Spirituality is viewed and studied as being more free-formed and psychological. Also, spirituality is considered to be a private experience that promotes a process of growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the psychology of coping with trauma, religion and spirituality can play very different roles. Some research shows that religion, but not spirituality can help with coping,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Tomas. (2012). Religion, but not spirituality, helps protect against post-earthquake trauma. Epiphenom.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other shows that intrinsic spirituality can be a very effective style of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vespa | first1 = A. | last2 = Jacobsen | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Spazzafumo | first3 = L. | last4 = Balducci | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Evaluation of intrapsychic factors, coping styles, and spirituality of patients affected by tumors | url = | journal = Psycho-Oncology | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 5–11 | doi = 10.1002/pon.1719 | pmid = 20336646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences found between religious and spiritual coping may be further evidence of the role of attachment styles and types of coping used. Through religious and spiritual coping, individuals can derive support from a divine being, from other members of a religious congregation, and from making meaning of distressing events, which can lead to the promotion of resilience, healing, and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with studying religious coping==
Studying religion as a coping mechanism has proved a difficult task for psychologists. Religion seems to be an integral part of some people's lives but not of others, so specialists cannot be certain whether religion is the variable to study or if there is something about religious people that makes them religious that is worth studying. Many studies only measure the frequency of certain "religious" activities including prayer or religious service attendance; however, just because a person exhibits religious behavior does not mean that he or she uses his or her religion to cope or even adheres to the set of beliefs that constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–480|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research done on religion and coping has been isolated to Christianity. Studies are being conducted to accommodate for the diversity of religions and their differences among cultures.

Many studies on the subject show contrary results. For example, some psychologists conclude that religiosity has no positive or negative outcomes at all and others cite that any form of religious coping has ultimately negative effects. These results may be a product of the inconsistencies in the ways that religion is studied as a coping mechanism or could reflect biases of researchers toward a certain religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Religion]] in [[North America]]''' spans the period of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] dwelling, [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlement, and the present day. Its various faiths have been a major influence on [[art]], [[culture]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]].

Between them, the [[United States]], [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]] account for 85 percent of the population of North America. Religion in each of these countries is dominated by [[Christianity]] (77.4),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-americas.aspx |title=Americas |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS |url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-christians.aspx |title=Global religious landscape: Christians |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest religion in North America.

'''Religion in the Faroe Islands''' consists largely of the [[Lutheran]] [[Church of the Faroe Islands]], but also includes smaller Protestant groups such as the [[Open Brethren]], as well as a few [[Roman Catholicism in the Faroe Islands|Catholics]] and adherents of non-[[Trinitarian]] religions, such as the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

The [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] is the established religion since it became independent in 2007; previously the [[Church of Denmark]] held that role.

The [[Faroe Islands]], located between Scotland and Iceland, are partly ruled by [[Denmark]], and as such the people long practiced the same religion as the Danes although religious observance is nowadays more widespread and intense among the Faroese.

==History==

The [[Faroe Islands]] became [[Christianity|Christianized]] between 850 and 1000. Evidence exists for conversions by [[Celtic Christian]] missionaries as early as 850,{{fact|date=August 2017}} but the [[Catholic Church]] was not established on the islands by the latter year. The ''[[Færeyinga saga]]'' is often cited with respect to the early spread of [[Christendom]] in the islands. The saga states that the king of Norway told Sigmund to go by ship to the Faroe Islands with orders from the King. Sigmund's orders were clear: he was supposed to make the 18 small islands Christian, which is what he did, according to the saga. This event is believed to have taken place around 1000, but the Faroese did not establish an organised congregation of the Catholic Church before around 1100, so there do appear to be some inconsistencies in the saga.

Originally belonging to [[Norway]], Faroe fell under the jurisdiction of Denmark in 1523. The last [[Catholic Bishop of the Faroe Islands]] was Ámundur Ólavsson (Amund); he was replaced by the first Lutheran bishop, Jens Gregersøn Riber, in 1540.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 Hindus (0.02%), 66 Buddhist (0.19%), 12 Jews (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 Sikh (0.01%), 149 Others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%) and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church has nearly 150 adherents. There are also small groups of [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Muslims]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] in the country.

'''Religious fanaticism''' is uncritical zeal or with an obsessive enthusiasm related to one's own, or one's group's, devotion to a [[religion]]&amp;nbsp;– a form of human [[fanaticism]] which could otherwise be expressed in one's other involvements and participation, including employment, role, and partisan affinities.

==Features==
Steffen gives several features associated with religious fanaticism or extremism:

* "Spiritual needs"... human beings have a spiritual longing for understanding and meaning, and given the mystery of [[existence]], that spiritual quest can only be fulfilled through some kind of relationship with ultimacy, whether or not that takes the form as a "transcendent other."  Religion has power to meet this need for meaning and transcendent relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSteffen2007|Steffen, Lloyd.]] p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Attractiveness"... it presents itself in such a way that those who find their way into it come to express themselves in ways consistent with the particular vision of ultimacy at the heart of this religious form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSteffen2007|Steffen, Lloyd.]] p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A "live option"... it is present to the moral consciousness as a live option that addresses spiritual need and satisfies human longing for meaning, power, and belonging.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSteffen2007|Steffen, Lloyd.]] p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of religious fanaticism==
[[File:Members of the Jansenist sect having convulsions and spasms Wellcome L0003021.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] sect having convulsions and spasms as a result of religious fanaticism. Engraving by [[Bernard Picart]]]]

===Christianity===
{{see also|Christianity and violence}}
Ever since Christianity was established, some of those in authority have sought to expand and control the church, often through the fanatical use of force.  Grant Shafer says, "Jesus of Nazareth is best known as a preacher of nonviolence"
&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idShafer2004|Shafer, Grant.]] p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;, although in Matthew 10:34 he says, "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword."
The start of Christian fanatic rule came with the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]] as Catholicism.  [[J. Harold Ellens|Ellens]] says, "When Christianity came to power in the empire of Constantine, it proceeded almost to viciously repress all non-Christians and all Christians who did not line up with official Orthodox ideology, policy, and practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEllens2004|Ellens, J. Harold.]] pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of Christians who didn't line up with Orthodox ideology is the [[Donatists]], who "refused to accept repentant clergy who had formerly given way to apostasy when persecuted".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idShafer2004|Shafer, Grant.]] p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fanatic Christian activity, as Catholicism, continued into the Middle Ages with the [[Crusades]].  These wars were attempts by the Catholics, sanctioned by the [[Pope]], to reclaim the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Muslims]]. However many Catholics see the crusades as a just war in self-defense. Charles Selengut, in his book ''Sacred Fury: Understanding Religious Violence'', said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Crusades were very much holy wars waged to maintain Christianity's theological and social control. On their way to conquering the Holy Land from the Muslims by force of arms, the crusaders destroyed dozens of Jewish communities and killed thousands because the Jews would not accept the Christian faith. Jews had to be killed in the religious campaign because their very existence challenged the sole truth espoused by the Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSelengut2008|Selengut, Charles. "Sacred Fury: Understanding Religious Violence."]] p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shafer adds that, "When the crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they killed Muslims, Jews, and native Christians indiscriminately".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idShafer2004|Shafer, Grant.]] p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another prominent form of fanaticism according to some came a few centuries later with the [[Spanish Inquisition]].  The Inquisition was the monarchy's way of making sure their people stayed within Catholic Christianity.  Selengut said, "The inquisitions were attempts at self-protection and targeted primarily "internal enemies" of the church".&lt;ref name="SelengutCharles"&gt;[[#Reference-idSelengut2008|Selengut, Charles.]] p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  The driving force of the Inquisition was the Inquisitors, who were responsible for spreading the truth of Christianity.  Selengut continues, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The inquisitors generally saw themselves as educators helping people maintain correct beliefs by pointing out errors in knowledge and judgment... Punishment and death came only to those who refused to admit their errors ... during the Spanish Inquisitions of the fifteenth century, the clear distinction between confession and innocence and remaining in error became muddled.... The investigators had to invent all sorts of techniques, including torture, to ascertain whether ... new converts' beliefs were genuine.&lt;ref name="SelengutCharles" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Islamic extremism|Extremism within Islam]] goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[Takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam’s ‘true believers’|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819100539/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|author=Mohamad Jebara More Mohamad Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri 2001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] have promoted the overthrow of secular governments.]]
[[Sayyid Qutb]], a figurehead of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt, was influential in promoting a [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamist]] ideology in the 1960s. When Qutb was executed by the [[Egyptian government]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] formed the organization [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] to replace the government with an [[Islamic state]] that would reflect Qutb's ideas for [[Islamic revival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Looming Tower]]|author=[[Lawrence Wright]]|publisher=Knopf|year=2006|isbn=0-375-41486-X|chapter = 2|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qutbist]] ideology has been influential in [[Jihadism|jihadist]] movements that seek to overthrow secular governments, and Qutb's books have been frequently been cited by [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].&lt;ref name="NYT: path to terror"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/world/09awlaki.html?pagewanted=5&amp;hp|title=Imam’s Path From Condemning Terror to Preaching Jihad|author1=Scott Shane |author2=Souad Mekhennet |author3=Robert F.

Eikmeier. From ''[[Parameters (journal)|Parameters]]'', Spring 2007, pp. 85–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[fatwa]] in 1998, radical [[jihad]] has increasingly become an internationally recognized term. Bin Laden's concept, though, is very different from the actual meaning of the term.  In the religious context, ''jihad'' most nearly means "working urgently for a certain godly objective, generally an imperialist one".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEllens2004|Ellens, J. Harold.]] p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The word jihad in Arabic means 'struggle'. The struggle can be a struggle of implementing the Islamic values in daily activities, a struggle with others to counter arguments against Islam, or self-defense when physically attacked because of belief in Islam. According to Steffen, there are portions of the Qur'an where military jihad is used.  As Steffen says, though, "Jihad in these uses is always defensive.  Not only does ‘jihad' not endorse acts of military aggression, but ‘jihad' is invoked in Qur'anic passages to indicate how uses of force are always subject to restraint and qualification".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSteffen2007|Steffen, Lloyd.]] p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of jihad differs greatly from the kind most commonly discussed today.

Thomas Farr, in an essay titled "Islam's Way to Freedom", says that, "Even though most Muslims reject violence, the [[extremists]]' use of sacred texts lends their actions authenticity and recruiting power". (Freedom 24)  He goes on to say, "The radicals insist that their central claim – God's desire for Islam's triumph – requires no interpretation. According to them, true Muslims will pursue it by any means necessary, including dissimulation, civil [[coercion]], and the killing of innocents". (Freedom 24)

According to certain observers this disregard for others and rampant use of violence is markedly different from the peaceful message that jihad is meant to employ. Although fanatic jihadists have committed many terroristic acts throughout the world, perhaps the best known is the [[September 11 attacks]].  According to Ellens, the al-Qaeda members who took part in the terrorist attacks did so out of their belief that, by doing it, they would "enact a devastating blow against the evil of secularized and non-Muslim America.  They were cleansing this world, God's temple".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEllens2004|Ellens, J. Harold.]] p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific form of religious fraud is '''[[pious fraud]]''' (Latin: ''pia fraus''), whereby one employs lies and/or deception in order to convince others of the truth of one's own religion or specific religious claims.

'''''Skeptic''''', colloquially known as '''''Skeptic magazine''''', is a quarterly [[science education]] and science advocacy [[magazine]] published internationally by [[The Skeptics Society]], a [[nonprofit]] organization devoted to promoting [[scientific skepticism]] and resisting the spread of [[pseudoscience]], [[superstition]], and [[irrationality|irrational]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/what_we_do/ |title=What We Do |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Skeptic (U.S. magazine) |access-date=March 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Michael Shermer]], founder of the Skeptics Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/meet_michael_shermer.html "Meet Michael Shermer"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine was first published in the spring of 1992 and is published through Millennium Press.
Shermer remains the Publisher and [[Editor-in-Chief]] of the magazine and the magazine’s Co-publisher and [[Art Director]] is Pat Linse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/masthead.html |title=Masthead, ''Skeptic'' Magazine. |accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy members of its editorial board include, or have included, [[Oxford University]] [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning scientist [[Jared Diamond]], [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] and [[escape artist]] turned educator [[James Randi|James “The Amazing” Randi]], actor, comedian, and ''[[Saturday Night Live]] '' alumna [[Julia Sweeney]], professional mentalist [[Mark Edward]], science writer [[Daniel Loxton]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] and [[Christof Koch]].
''Skeptic'' has an international circulation with over 50,000 subscriptions and is on newsstands in the U.S. and Canada as well as Europe, Australia, and other countries.&lt;ref name="skeptic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vueweekly.com/making_a_living_of_bullshit_detecting/ | title=Making a living of bullshit detecting | publisher=[[VUE Weekly]] |date=August 27, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History, format and structure ==
The cover story of the magazine's very first issue paid tribute to [[scientist]] and [[science-fiction]] writer [[Isaac Asimov]].
&lt;ref name=Skeptic1&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv01n1&amp;Category_Code=BIA "Vol. 1 No.1 (Premiere Issue) Tribute to Isaac Asimov"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As Asimov wrote a number of stories featuring robots and coined the term "[[robotics]]", the cover of volume 12, #2 (2006), which is devoted to the topic of artificial intelligence, depicts a [[robot]] sitting on a park bench reading that first issue.&lt;ref name="Skeptic2"&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv12n2 "Vol. 12 No. 2 Artificial Intelligence"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every issue of the magazine opens with a description of The Skeptics Society and its mission statement, which is to explore subjects such as [[creationism]], [[pyramid power]], [[Bigfoot]], [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical claims]] (as in the examples of [[Holocaust denial]] and extreme [[Afrocentrism]]), the use or misuse of theory and [[statistics]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[urban myths]], [[witch-hunt]]s, [[mass hysterias]], [[genius]] and [[intelligence]], and cultural influences on science, as well as controversies involving [[protoscience]]s at the leading edge of established science, and even [[fads]] like [[cryonics]] and [[low-carb diet]]s.  In addition to publishing the magazine, the Society also:

* sponsors lecture series at the [[California Institute of Technology]]
* produces and sells tapes of the lectures, as well as other books on pertinent subjects
* holds field trips to investigate and research such subjects
* conducts social events to promote good-will
* provides resources for the public, skeptic organizations (such as [[SkeptiCamp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepticamp.org | title=Skepticamp | accessdate =2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the media, with which they may approach controversial subjects from a skeptical viewpoint

In 2011, the magazine had three regular columnists: [[James Randi]] wrote "’Twas Brillig…," [[Harriet A. Hall]] wrote "The Skep Doc" and [[Karen Stollznow]] wrote "Bad Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Table of Contents | magazine=Skeptic | publisher=Skeptics Society | url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol16n02.html | volume=16 | issue=2 | accessdate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine's page count was between approximately 100 and 110 pages until the 2010s. It was reduced to approximately 80 pages with Vol. 16 No. 3 (2011).{{CN|date=March 2018}} {{As of |2018}}, the magazine had two regular columnists: Harriet A. Hall and [[Carol Tavris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptic: CURRENT ISSUE: VOLUME 23 NUMBER 1|url=https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|website=skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330232530/https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|archivedate=30 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typical topics ===
Each issue features an [[editorial]]. In the past this was provided by [[James Randi]], and was often a reaction to stories from mainstream news media such as the 2005 story by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[newsmagazine]] ''[[Primetime Live]]'' featuring a [[Brazil]]ian [[faith healer]], [[João de Deus (medium)|João Teixeira]].{{CN|date=March 2018}} Other times Randi wrote about topics he had investigated in the past, such as alleged [[dowser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-08-31/#feature/|title = A Report from the Paranormal Trenches|website=Skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|date = 2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged [[psychic]]s like [[Sylvia Browne]], and UFOs.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The magazine also features a large correspondence section called "Forum". This includes not only letters from lay readers but also in-depth comments and rebuttals from [[professional]]s, contributing to extended academic debate across issues raised in past editions.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The bulk of the magazine treats a variety of topics. [[Front cover|Cover stories]] have ranged from examination of alleged [[UFO]]s in [[religious icons]] and theories of the likelihood of [[artificial intelligence]] to tributes to luminaries such as [[Isaac Asimov]]&lt;ref name=Skeptic1/&gt; and [[Ernst Mayr]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sulloway, Frank J.]] (February 2005). [http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-02-11/ "Ernst Mayr, 1904–2005Remembrances &amp; Tribute"]. ''Skeptic''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some editions feature special sections devoted to a particular topic or theme that is examined through multiple articles by different authors, such as [[intelligent design]] - a frequently recurring topic in the magazine, given the ongoing [[creation vs. evolution controversy]].{{CN|date=March 2018}}

=== ''Junior Skeptic'' ===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:JuniorSkeptic.jpg|thumb|right|''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, and is written and illustrated in a manner more appealing to children]] --&gt;
Bound into most issues is a 10-page young-readers' section called ''[[Junior Skeptic]]''.  Heralded by a cover printed on glossy paper (the rest of the magazine is printed on non-glossy stock), ''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, or provides practical instruction written and illustrated in a style more appealing to children.

[[Daniel Loxton]] is the Editor of ''Junior Skeptic''. He writes and illustrates most issues.

The first edition of ''Junior Skeptic'' appeared in volume 6, #2 of ''Skeptic'' (2000).

The organization is based in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. Its motto, designated in 1996, is: "Together for the persecuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/om_oss/english/Stefanus+Alliance+International.9UFRjYYc.ips|title=Stefanus Alliance International|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''Stefanus Alliance International'' was established in 1967 by [[Monrad Norderval]], Anutza Moise, Vemund Skard, Else-Marie Skard and Gulbrand Øverbye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/om_oss/kort_historikk/|title=Kort historikk|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was earlier known as the ''Mission Behind the Iron Curtain'', or the ''Norwegian Mission to the East.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://snl.no/Stefanusalliansen|title=Stefanusalliansen|last=|first=|date=|website=Store Norske Leksikon|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization decided at its meeting of October 29, 2011 to change its name to ''Stefanus Alliance International'' as of January 1, 2012. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norsk Misjon i Øst skifter navn|page=12|work=Vårt Land|date=31 October 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

''Stefanus Alliance International'' provides support, care, and practical help for churches and individuals who are persecuted or oppressed because of their religious beliefs. The organisation also advocates on behalf of Christians and others who have had their religious rights violated. It commissioned a radio in 1968, published the newspaper ''Ropet fra Øst'' in 1971, and helped establish [[Forum 18]] news service in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/om_oss/kort_historikk/|title=Kort historikk|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
