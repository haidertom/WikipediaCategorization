[[File:Rodoljub Šabić.jpg|thumb|Rodoljub Šabić, Commissioner for Information and protection of personal data]]
'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Serbia]], access to public information is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the Law on free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009. 
The '''scope of the right''' entails that everyone in Serbia has the right to access to information of public importance and to be informed whether public authorities hold specific information, whether such information is already accessible, and to obtain a copy of the requested information.&lt;ref name="Serbia Commissioner for Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/en/contents-of-the-right.html| title= Contents of the right regarding access to information of public importance |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= 17 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Protection of personal data is the authority entitled by law to monitor the respect of obligations entailed by this Law.

==Legal framework==
Serbia is considered among the countries with the best regulatory framework regarding access to information of public relevance: the Global Right to Information Rating, compiled by NGOs AccessInfo and Centre for Law and Democracy, ranks the country in the second position in its global ranking assessing the quality of legislative frameworks regulating FOI across the world.&lt;ref name="RTI Rating"&gt;{{cite web |date=2016 |title=Global Right to Information Rating |url=http://www.rti-rating.org/view_country/?country_name=Serbia |access-date= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of access to public information is defined in Article 51 of the [[Constitution of Serbia]], which establishes the right of everybody to be informed about issues of public importance and the deriving obligation of state bodies and public organizations to guarantee the access to such information.&lt;ref name= "Serbian Constitution"&gt;{{cite constitution |article= 51 |section= II |country= Serbia |language= en |ratified=2006 |url=http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav.php?change_lang=en |accessdate=17 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access to information of public relevance is translated into national law by the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/en/pravni-okvir-pi/laws-pi/881-zakon-o-slobodnom-pristupu-informacijama-od-javnog-znacaja-preciscen-tekst-sl-glasnik-rs-12004-5407-10409-i-3610.html | title=Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance |access-date= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of the law is valued positively especially inasmuch as it extends the right to access to information '''to all natural person''', notwithstanding their citizenship, temporary or permanent residence in the country.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

Moreover, the right to access information applies to the executive, legislative and judicial bodies, State-owned enterprises, as well as other public authorities and private bodies that perform a public function or that receive significant public funding are also obliged to disclose information of public relevance (Art. 3).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

Requests should be lodged in written form, with no need for the applicant to specify the reason for the request.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;
The public authority shall reply without delay and within 15 days at the latest. If the requested information entails consequences for the protection of a person's life or freedom, public health and the environment, the time span at the disposal of authorities is reduced to 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt; In cases in which the document contains information that the public has no legitimate interest to know, the applicant has the right to access to other parts of the documents.

Limitations to the right to access to information are defined in Article 9 of the Law, establishing that legitimate limitation may derive if the requested information exposes to risk the life, health, safety or another vital interest of a person; if it obstacles the work of the judiciary; if it threatens national defense, national and public safety, international relations or the government's ability to manage the national economic processes. Finally, classified information are excluded from the right.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

The authority in charge of monitoring the respect of the Law is the '''Commissioner for Information of Public Importance'''. The Commissioner is an independent, second-level appeal instance: if a public authority does not respond to the request within the deadline, the applicant may lodge a complaint with the Commissioner, except in cases prescribed by this Law (Art.16).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

The Commissioner is entitled by Law to issue decisions on disputed cases, and his/her decisions should be enforced by the Government of the Republic of Serbia if necessary (Art 28).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt; The Commissioner is appointed by the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia on proposal of the Committee of the National Assembly responsible for information. The position of the Commissioner for Information has been held since 2004 by Rodoljub Šabić, who was appointed for an initial 7-years term and then re-elected in 2011.

Aside from examining individual complaints related to violations of the right to free access to information, the Commissioner also addresses citizens’ requests asking how to exercise their right to information, provides to state authorities opinions about the implementation of the law, trainings for law implementation and takes part in activities related to the EU accession process.

It has been noted that a significant '''limitation of the right''' set forth in the Constitution is due to the restrictions applied to the admissibility of complaints against first instance decisions: a complaint is not admissible if “lodged against decisions of the National Assembly, the President of the Republic, the Government of the Republic of Serbia, the Supreme Court of Serbia, the Constitutional Court and the Republic Public Prosecutor” (Art. 22).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedominfo.org/2004/11/serbian-parliament-adopts-access-law/ FreedomInfo.org]{{Retrieved|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Since the adoption of the Law on Access to Information in 2004, a significant increase in the number of requests has been registered by the entitled Commissioner, pointing to the positive fact that the right is increasing being used by citizens and media professionals in Serbia. At the same time, the increasing number of complaints filed to the Commissioner demonstrates the reluctancy by authorities to timely and fully comply with the obligation established by the Law on access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Serbia/Serbia-the-hard-fight-for-information-177372 |title=Serbia: the hard fight for information |last=Maja|first=Poznatov |date=13 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Beta / Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa |access-date=24 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its annual report for 2015, the Commissioner for Information notes some limitation to the effective implementation of the law. These have to do, according to the Commissioner, particularly with insufficient accountability for violations of the Law and inefficient mechanisms of enforcement of the Commissioner’s decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/images/stories/dokumentacija-nova/izvestajiPoverenika/2015/IZVESTAJ2015/engrezime.pdf |title= Summary of the report on the implementation of the law on Free Access to Information|last=Commissioner for Information in Serbia |date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the implementation of the Law on Access to Information in Serbia and its impact on the exercise of journalism, Freedom House has noted in 2016 that “Despite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists’ efforts to obtain public information”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/serbia |title= Freedom of the press in Serbia|last=Freedom House |date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017|quote=“Despite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists’ efforts to obtain public information”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern over implementation, alignment with European standards, endowment of resources to the Commissioner for Information and enforcement of his decisions is highlighted also by the [[European Union]] in its annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_serbia.pdf |title= EU Serbia Progress Report 2016| date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth Initiative for Human Rights v. Serbia===
A landmark case by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] related to the right to access to information in Serbia. 
In 2006, the Belgrade-based NGO [[Youth Initiative for Human Rights]] (YIHR) filed a request to the Serbian [[Security Intelligence Agency]] demanding information concerning the use of electronic surveillance measures by that agency in 2005. 
The Agency denied access to the requested information twice, first on grounds of secrecy and then, after a binding decision by the Commissioner for Information stating that the information should be made public, by declaring that it did not hold the requested information.&lt;ref name=Voohroof&gt;{{cite web| url=https://strasbourgobservers.com/2013/07/08/article-10-of-the-convention-includes-the-right-of-access-to-data-held-by-intelligence-agency/#more-2125 |title=Article 10 of the Convention includes the right of access to data held by an intelligence agency |last=Voorhoof |first=Dirk |date=8 July 2013 |website=Strasbourg Observer |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YIHR appealed to the European Court of Human Rights under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6]] and [[Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights|Article 10]] of the Convention.
In June 2013, the verdict of the ECtHR defined “unpersuasive” the argument used by the Agency according to which it did not hold the information requested and found that the restrictions imposed by the Serbian intelligence agency were not justified by domestic law and hence constituted a violation of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=Voohroof/&gt;

'''Air rights''' are the property interest in the "space" above the earth's surface. Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a [[building]] includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others.

This legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' ("''Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell''."), which appears in [[medieval Roman law]] and is credited to 13th-century [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]; it was notably popularized in [[common law]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766) by [[William Blackstone]]; see [[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos#Origins|origins of phrase]] for details.&lt;!-- See refs there --&gt;

== Air travel ==
&lt;!---knowledgeable people can add other countries here, but the first part is germane to all countries---&gt;
{{Further information|Flyover rights}}
Property rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before [[air travel]] became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a legal right for the public to transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the public easement in the space at these higher altitudes and landowner rights to the exclusive use of the airspace at lower altitudes have been well documented by the U.S. judiciary.

New technologies have again raised questions about ownership of "space" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty.  With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated.

===United States===
[[File:Building cantilever New York.JPG|thumb|right|A building is cantilevered over two other buildings in [[New York City]]]]
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has the sole authority to control all "publicly owned" [[airspace]], exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18 , §&amp;nbsp;40103 "use of airspace"&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: "The [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103- |title=49 U.S.C. 40103(a)(1) |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all the airspace is "possessed" by the United States.  For non-public airspace, Congress has provided authority for the FAA to purchase this non-public airspace near airports to accommodate planes taking off and landing.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C §&amp;nbsp;40110&lt;/ref&gt;  The "navigable airspace" in which the public has a right of transit without affecting a landowner's property rights has been set at the height of 500&amp;nbsp;ft in urban or suburban areas,&lt;ref&gt;"Argent v. U.S. 124 F.3rd 1277,1281 (1997) citing Lacey v. United States, 219 Ct.Cl. 551, 595 F.2d 614, 616 (1979) (treating 500 feet as line of demarcation between compensatable property taking and non-compensatable overflights); Matson v. United States, 145 Ct.Cl. 225, 171 F.Supp. 283, 286 (1959) (providing compensation for flights under 500 feet).Aaron v. United States, 160 Ct.Cl. 295, 311 F.2d 798, 801 (1963) (allowing claims based on flights below 500ft, while denying those based on flights over 500ft).”&lt;/ref&gt; and 360 feet above the surface or tallest structure in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;   The exact altitude(s) at which the  airspace over private land becomes "public" airspace, or where the upward bounds of national sovereignty extends is often debated, but the Supreme Court rulings and space treaties are clear.  A landowner's domain extends up to at least 365 feet above the ground. see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17209011020287234065 Causby v US (1946)],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; and no nation can prevent orbits above the Earth's atmosphere.

The FAA is required to pay financial compensation to property owners when their property interests are taken for overflights.   Compensated landowners may then be required to waive any putative damages for interference with "air rights" in order to avoid [[lawsuit]]s from future owners' nuisance claims against low flying aircraft.  This is called a navigation or navigational [[easement]].

The low cost of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (also called drones) in the 2000s re-raised legal questions regarding whose permission is required to fly at low altitudes; the landowner, the FAA or both.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=317074394&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the FAA reestablished that navigable airspace is the space above 500 feet,&lt;ref&gt;Doc. No. 18334, 54 FR 34294, Aug. 18, 1989, as amended by Amdt. 91-311, 75 FR 5223, Feb. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the FAA also set regulations which allow drones to fly below 400 feet in order to prevent interference with planes above that height.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-15079.pdf F.R. 2016 6-28-2016 Pgs 42063- 42214 DOC #: 2016-15079]&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAA's actions are expected to see challenges in the judiciary.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

== Railroads and air rights ==
[[Rail transport|Railroads]] were the first companies to realize the potential of making money from their air rights. A good example of this is [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]], where [[William J. Wilgus]], chief engineer of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]], devised a plan to earn profit from air rights. At first, the railroad simply constructed a platform above the rail yards to allow for the development of buildings overhead. By 1954, the railroad began to realize it could sell more air rights and Grand Central Terminal was proposed to be replaced by a 50-story tower. This is how the [[MetLife Building|Pan Am Building]] came to be built next to the station, after public protest regarding the demolition of Grand Central Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |title=Grand Central Terminal; The 23-Story, Beaux-Arts 1913 Tower That Wasn't |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 11, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/realestate/streetscapes-grand-central-terminal-23-story-beaux-arts-1913-tower-that-wasn-t.html |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been used in Chicago since the construction of the [[One Prudential Plaza|Prudential Building]] in 1955 above active railroad tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dedicate New Prudential 41 Story Building |last=Fuller|first=Ernest |date=December 9, 1955 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1955/12/09/page/13/article/dedicate-new-prudential-41-story-building |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, to the west of the Chicago River, [[River Point]] and [[150 North Riverside]] were built above tracks leading to the Amtrak station.

Building on platforms over railroad tracks is still potentially very profitable. In the mid-2000s, New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) attempted to sell air rights to the [[New York Jets]] so that they could build the [[West Side Stadium]] over Manhattan's [[West Side Yard]], near [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], as part of the [[Hudson Yards Redevelopment]]. The [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards mega-development]] was eventually built over the rail yard. In Brooklyn, the [[Barclays Center]] and [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] have been constructed over Atlantic Yards.

Similar to railroads, builders of [[highway]]s have proposed selling their air rights; [[Boston]] did this in connection with the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCown |first=James |date=September 4, 2002 |title=Boston Air Rights |journal=Architecture Week |volume=113 |issue=4 |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0904/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles|city of Los Angeles]] funded a $100,000 feasibility study [[RFP]] in January 2007 to explore building a freeway cap park in [[Hollywood]].  The park would be built above [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US highway 101]] and contain {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of new parkland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodfreewaycentralpark.org/ » Community-Wide Hollywood Central Park Meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air rights in development ==
The owner of the land has the exclusive development rights in the 'space' above his lands. Under common law, building a 'hangover' that breaks the vertical plane of a neighbor's property is a trespass and the property owner has the right to remove the offending structure. The airspace is property and retains developmental rights which can be sold or transferred. Thus in a dense downtown area, each building in the area may have the right to thirty-five stories of airspace above his own property. The owners of an older building of only three stories high could make a great deal of money by selling their building and allowing a thirty-five-story skyscraper to be built in its place. For example, a skyscraper developer may purchase the unused airspace from an adjacent landowner in order to develop a broader building. In November 2005, Christ Church in New York sold its vertical development rights for a record $430 per square foot, making more than $30 million on the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagli |first=Charles V. |title=$430 a Square Foot, for Air?

{{About|the professional body of lawyers|other uses|Bar (disambiguation)}}
{{about||the broader meaning of "bar" in [[law|legal]] contexts|Bar (law)|the ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' episode|Bar Association (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)}}

A '''bar association''' is a [[professional association]] of [[lawyer]]s. Some bar associations are responsible for the regulation of the legal profession in their [[jurisdiction]]; others are professional organizations dedicated to serving their members; in many cases, they are both. In many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, the bar association comprises lawyers who are qualified as [[barrister]]s or [[advocate]]s in particular, versus [[solicitor]]s (see ''[[bar council]]''). Membership in bar associations may be mandatory or optional for practicing attorneys, depending on [[jurisdiction]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Bar (law)}}
The use of the term ''[[bar (law)|bar]]'' to mean "the whole body of lawyers, the legal profession" comes ultimately from [[England|English]] custom. In the early 16th century, a [[wikt:railing|railing]] divided the hall in the [[Inns of Court]], with students occupying the body of the hall and readers or [[bencher]]s on the other side. Students who officially became lawyers crossed the [[symbol]]ic physical barrier and were "admitted to the bar".&lt;ref name=etymologyonline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bar|title=Etymology: Bar |accessdate=December 11, 2006|publisher=EtymologyOnline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this was popularly assumed to mean the wooden railing marking off the area around the judge's seat in a courtroom, where prisoners stood for arraignment and where a [[barrister]] stood to plead.  In modern courtrooms, a railing may still be in place to enclose the space which is occupied by legal [[counsel]] as well as the [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[defendant]]s and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[litigant]]s who have business pending before the court.

==In Commonwealth jurisdictions==
{{main|Bar council}}
In many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, including [[Barristers in England and Wales|in England and Wales]], the "bar association" comprises lawyers who are qualified as [[barrister]]s or [[advocate]]s (collectively known as "the bar", or "members of the bar"), while the "[[law society]]" comprises [[solicitor]]s. These bodies are sometimes mutually exclusive, while in other jurisdictions, the "bar" may refer to the entire community of persons engaged in the [[practice of law]].

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], one is ''[[Call to the bar|called to the bar]]'' after undertaking a post-[[Law school|law-school]] training in a [[province|provincial]] law society program, and undergoing an [[apprenticeship]] or ''taking articles''. Legal communities are called ''provincial [[Law society|law societies]]'', except for [[Nova Scotia]], where it is called the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, and [[Quebec]], where it is called the ''[[Barreau du Quebec]]''.

The Canadian Bar Association (and its provincial and territorial branches) is a professional association of barristers, solicitors and avocats that serves the roles of advocates for the profession, provides continuing legal education and member benefits. It does not play a part in the regulation of the profession, however.

===India===
In [[India]] under the legal framework set established under the Advocates Act, 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ADVOCATES ACT, 1961 |url=http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=''[[Bar Council of India]]'' |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a law graduate is required to be enrolled with the [[Bar Council of India]]. The process of enrollment is delegated by the Bar Council of India to the state Bar Councils wherein almost each [[States of india|state]] has a Bar Council of its own. Once enrolled with a State Bar Council, the law graduate is recognized as an [[Advocate#Advocates_in_India|Advocate]]  provisionally for a period of two years, within which they must clear the All India Bar Examination (AIBE) conducted by the Bar Council of India. Once the advocate clears the AIBE test, they are entitled to appear and practice before any court of law in India. There is no formal requirement for further membership of any Bar Association. However, Advocates do become members of various local or national bar associations for reasons of recognition and facilities which these associations offer. Some well-known Bar Associations in India include the [http://www.scbaindia.org/ Supreme Court Bar Association], [http://dhcba.com/ Delhi High Court Bar Association], [http://bombaybar.com/ Bombay Bar Association], [http://delhibarassociation.com/ Delhi Bar Association], National Bar Association of India, All India Bar Association, etc.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], a person becomes a licensee of a Provincial Bar Council after fulfilling certain requirements. He must have a valid law degree [[LL.B]] from a recognized university by the Pakistan Bar council, must offer certain undertakings, and pay the Provincial Bar Council fees. Furthermore, he shall  join any bar association as a member. Tehsil bar associations work under the umbrella  of District Bar Association, District Bar Association under Provincial Bar councils, such as the [[Punjab Bar Council]] and [[Sindh Bar Council]]. To become an advocate, one must first complete six months [[pupillage]] with a practising advocate of High Court, whom they must assist on at least ten cases during a six-month pupillage.

==In the United States==
:''Membership in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions.''
::—[[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], ''In re Rouss'', 221 N.Y. 81, 84 (1917)
[[Image:Massbar.jpg|thumb|right|Sign outside the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts]]
In the United States, [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] is permission granted by a particular court system to a lawyer to practice law in that system. This is to be distinguished from membership in a bar association. In the United States, some states require membership in the [[state bar association]] for all attorneys, while others do not.

Although bar associations historically existed as unincorporated [[voluntary association]]s, nearly all bar associations have since been organized (or reorganized) as [[corporation]]s.  Furthermore, membership in some of them (see the next section below) is no longer voluntary, which is why some of them have omitted the word "association" and merely call themselves the "state bar" to indicate that they ''are'' the incorporated body that constitutes the entire admitted legal profession of a state.

===Mandatory, integrated, or unified bar associations===
Some states require membership in the state's bar association to practice law there. Such an organization is called a mandatory, integrated, or unified bar,&lt;ref&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul: Thomson West, 2006), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The concept of the integrated bar was discussed in ''[[Keller v. State Bar of California]],'' {{ussc|496|1|1990}}, in which the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] agreed with the [[Supreme Court of California]] that the state could force lawyers to join the [[State Bar of California]] and pay fees as a condition of practicing law in the state. However, the Court then went on to hold that the state bar could not force lawyers to pay for political and ideological activities with which they did not agree.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a type of [[government-granted monopoly]].  They exist at present in a slight majority of [[U.S. state]]s: [[Alabama State Bar|Alabama]], [[Alaska Bar Association|Alaska]], [[State Bar of Arizona|Arizona]], [[State Bar of California|California]], [[The Florida Bar|Florida]], [[State Bar of Georgia|Georgia]], [[Hawaii State Bar Association|Hawaii]], [[Idaho State Bar|Idaho]], [[Kentucky Bar Association|Kentucky]], [[Louisiana State Bar Association|Louisiana]], [[Maine State Bar Association|Maine]], [[State Bar of Michigan|Michigan]], [[The Mississippi Bar|Mississippi]], [[The Missouri Bar|Missouri]], [[State Bar of Montana|Montana]], [[Nebraska State Bar Association|Nebraska]], [[State Bar of Nevada|Nevada]], [[New Hampshire Bar Association|New Hampshire]], [[State Bar of New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[State Bar Association of North Dakota|North Dakota]], [[Oklahoma Bar Association|Oklahoma]], [[Oregon State Bar|Oregon]], [[Rhode Island Bar Association|Rhode Island]], [[South Carolina Bar|South Carolina]], [[State Bar of South Dakota|South Dakota]], [[State Bar of Texas|Texas]], [[Utah State Bar|Utah]], [[Virginia State Bar|Virginia]], [[Washington State Bar Association|Washington State]], [[State Bar of West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[State Bar of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming State Bar|Wyoming]].  The [[District of Columbia Bar|District of Columbia]], the [[Bar of the U.S. Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam Bar Association|Guam]] and the [[CNMI Bar Association|Northern Mariana Islands]] also have unified bars. The mandatory status of the [[Puerto Rico Bar Association]] was eliminated in 2009 by an act of the legislature, ratified by recently appointed majority of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. By act of the Puerto Rico legislature, the mandatory status was reinstated in June, 2014.  The [[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico]] struck down this act in October, 2014, finding that it unconstitutionally usurped its powers.  

In some states, like Wisconsin, the mandatory membership requirement is implemented through an order of the [[state supreme court]], which can be revoked or canceled at any time at the court's discretion. In others, like Oregon, the state legislature passed a law and created a government agency. California went farther than any other state and wrote the State Bar of California into [[California Constitution|its constitution]].

The first state to have an integrated bar association was North Dakota in 1921.&lt;ref name=fried&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Lawrence M.|authorlink1=Lawrence M. Friedman|title=American Law in the Twentieth Century|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0300102994|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUNjxn3RvVAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary bar associations===
A [[Voluntary association|voluntary]] bar association is a private organization of lawyers. However, the membership may not be restricted only to registered lawyers. The membership can extend to people interested in goals and purpose of the Association. Each Association chooses its own purposes (e.g., social, educational, and lobbying functions), but does not regulate the practice of law or admit lawyers to practice.

There is a statewide voluntary bar association in every state that has no mandatory or integrated bar association. There are also many voluntary bar associations organized by city, county, or other community. Such associations are often focused on common professional interests (such as [[bankruptcy]] lawyers or in-house counsel) or common [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] interests (such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], or [[nation]]al heritage), such as the [[Hispanic National Bar Association]]. The [[American Bar Association]] is the voluntary bar association with the largest membership. Such associations often advocate for law reform and provide information in [[bar journals]], [[pro bono]] services or a [[lawyer referral service]] to the general public. In 2017, the [[California State Legislature]] split off the education, lobbying, and young lawyers sections of that state's Bar in order to create the voluntary California Lawyers Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calawyers.org|title=California Lawyers Association|author=|date=|website=calawyers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no mandatory federal bar association. The [[Federal Bar Association]] is a private, voluntary group. 

There are also a number of subject-specific private associations, which are not ''officially'' denominated as bar associations but which serve similar functions in terms of providing their members with useful publications, networking opportunities, and [[continuing legal education]]. The largest association of defense counsel is the [[Defense Research Institute]] (the "Voice of the Defense Bar"), while the largest association of plaintiffs' counsel is the [[American Association for Justice]] (formerly Association of Trial Lawyers of America). The [[National Lawyers Guild]] (NLG) is an association of progressive attorneys and legal workers, founded as the first national lawyer's association with membership open to all races and religions.  

Most American law schools have a [[student bar association]], which is a [[student organization]] that fulfills various functions, including sometimes serving as the [[Students' union|student government]].

===Judges===
[[Judge]]s may or may not be members of the bar. Etymologically, they sit "on the bench", and the [[Legal case|cases]] which come before them are "at bar" or "at bench".  Many states in the United States require that some or all judges be members of the bar; typically these limit or completely prohibit the judges from practicing law while serving as a judge.

The [[U.S. Constitution]] contains no requirement that Federal judges or [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices be members of the bar. However, there are no modern instances of the President nominating or the Congress approving any candidate who is not a member of any bar. There are various professional associations of judges, such as the American Judges Association,  that perform some of the educational and other service functions of bar associations.

The [[Anglican Communion]] as a whole, unlike the [[Roman Catholic Church]], does not have a centralised [[canon law]] of its own.{{sfn|Skyes|Booty|1988|p=206}}  Each of the autonomous member churches of the communion, however, does have a canonical system.  Some, such as the [[Church of England]] have an ancient, highly developed [[Canon law (Church of England)|canon law]] while others, such as the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] have more recently developed canonical systems originally based on the English canon law.

'''CaseMap''' was introduced 1998 as [[relational database]] [[software]] for law offices to store and retrieve [[evidence]] and sources of evidence in litigation.

The program's documentation refers to these types of data as ''objects''. Using the program involves linking the various sources of evidence (e.g., documents, [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s, and persons) to facts that are relevant in the case and to the issues to be decided in the case. The facts table can be sorted by date to provide a chronology of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3057">'''The Collateral Consequences Calculator''' is a legal website designed to aid judges, attorney, and legal academics in their research of [[collateral consequences of criminal charges]]. It is currently being developed as a joint project between students in the Lawyering in the Digital Age Clinic at Columbia Law School and the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/portfolio/law/collateral_consequen.html|title=Project Portfolio {{!}} Collateral Consequences Calculator}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content is overseen by legal experts in the covered areas.

==History==
Judith Kaye, former Chief Judge of the State of New York, initiated the Partners in Justice Colloquium in 2005 to bring together judges, legal practitioners, and law professors to improve collaboration between the different legal spheres concerning social justice issues. The focus of this initial conference was to gain a better understanding of [[collateral consequences of criminal charges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partners in Justice: Introduction|url=http://law.nyu.edu/journals/reviewoflawandsocialchange/issues/ECM_PRO_066270}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results was the development of the "Four C's" website, which provides a collection of resources in each of the substantive areas where collateral consequences may occur. Due to the success of this site, development began on the Collateral Consequences Calculator, a "groundbreaking initiative" that will provide a convenient, easy-to-use overview of collateral consequences associated with specific sections of [[New York State Penal Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaye|first=Chief Judge Judith|title=The State of the Judiciary (2007)|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/asx/soj07.asx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became publicly available on in May, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Storey|first=Jeff|title=Collateral Consequences Calculator is Launched|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202458170648&amp;News_In_Brief&amp;hbxlogin=1|accessdate=13 April 2011|newspaper=New York Law Journal|date=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Status==
The Calculator currently provides information in two important areas: immigration and public housing eligibility in New York City. The immigration consequences have been determined for the top 51 crimes that are either commonly charged or have commonly misunderstood immigration consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collateral Consequences Calculator|url=http://calculator.law.columbia.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The housing consequences have been determined for the entire New York penal code, but apply only to New York City public housing.

'''''Collymore v Attorney General''''' [1969] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1969/1969_11.pdf UKPC 11] is a case of the [[Privy Council]] relevant for [[UK labour law]], concerning the [[right to strike]].

==Facts==
Collymore and other trade union members for oil companies claimed that a new Industrial Stabilisation Act 1965 in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] was ultra vires the constitution, which guaranteed freedom of association. The Act required no strikes pending binding arbitration.

==Judgment==
The Privy Council advised that the Act did not breach the Constitution. Lord Donovan said the following:

{{Cquote|The question thus posed is therefore simply a question of construction. But the arguments presented for the appellants, based on the assertion that the right to free collective bargaining and the right to strike are essential elements in freedom of association in trade unions, led to a prolonged examination in the courts below as to whether there is in law any "right" to strike. The question does not really arise if the respondent's contention as above summarised is right: for if "freedom of association" does not of itself import freedom to bargain collectively and to do so effectively by means of a strike, it is immaterial whether strike action is or is not the exercise of a "right" or a "freedom" or the enjoyment of "an immunity." Since, however, the matter was exhaustively canvassed in the courts below, their Lordships may say that they are in substantial agreement with the analysis of the situation which emerged. It was agreed before their Lordships that trade union law in Trinidad and Tobago was the same as trade union law in Great Britain as at the date when the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, took effect. Neither before that date nor since has there been in Great Britain any express enactment by statute of any right to strike, although in certain quarters such an enactment is still advocated. At common law before the enactment of the [[Trade Union Act 1871]], the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]], and the amendment to section 3 thereof effected by section 1 of the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], combinations of workmen to improve their wages and conditions were certainly in peril if in combination they withheld their labour or threatened to do so: but (subject to certain esoteric questions arising out of the decision in ''[[Rookes v Barnard]]'' [1964] AC 1129 and still unresolved by the [[Trade Disputes Act 1965]]) it is now well recognised that by reason of the statutes cited, as well as by decisions such as ''[[Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch]]'' [1942] AC 435 employees may lawfully withhold their labour in combination free from the restrictions and penalties which the common law formerly imposed. In this sense there is "freedom to strike."}}

A '''concession''' or '''concession agreement''' is a grant of rights, land or property by a government, local authority, corporation, individual or other legal entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-concession-agreement.htm#did-you-know What is a concession agreement?], wisegeek.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public services]] such as [[water supply]] may be operated as a concession. In the case of a public service concession, a private company enters into an agreement with the government to have the exclusive right to operate, maintain and carry out [[investment]] in a public utility (such as a [[water privatisation]]) for a given number of years. Other forms of contracts between public and private entities, namely [[lease contract]] and [[management contract]] (in the water sector often called by the French term ''affermage''), are closely related but differ from a concession in the rights of the operator and its remuneration. A lease gives a company the right to operate and maintain a public utility, but investment remains the responsibility of the public. Under a management contract the operator will collect the revenue only on behalf of the government and will in turn be paid an agreed fee.

A grant of land or property by a government may be in return for services or for a particular use, a right to undertake and profit by a specified activity, a lease for a particular purpose. A concession may include the right to use some existing [[infrastructure]] required to carry out a business (such as a water supply system in a city); in some cases, such as [[mining]], it may involve merely the transfer of exclusive or non-exclusive [[easement]]s.

In the private sector, the owner of a concession &amp;mdash; the ''concessionaire'' &amp;mdash; typically pays either a fixed sum or a percentage of revenue to the owner of the entity from which it operates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/concessionagreement.asp Definition of concession agreement] investorpedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of concessions within another business are [[concession stand]]s within sporting venues and movie theaters and concessions in [[department stores]] operated by other [[retailer]]s. Short term concessions may be granted as promotional space for periods as short as one day.

Depending on what the law that is related to a sector states, concession can either allow the authority to retain or keep ownership of the assets, turning over to the concessionaire and reverting the ownership back to an authority once the duration of their concession ended, or both the authority and concessionaire own the facilities.

==Early history==
[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] used contracts called concessions to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=34,36|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For other examples of concessions, see ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' and [[History of rail transport in the United States|United States railroad policy]].

==European Union regulation==
Within the [[European Union]], the granting of concessions by public bodies is subject to regulation. Works concessions have been subject to award rules for some time as Directive 2004/18/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council]] on [[Government procurement in the European Union|public procurement]] applied to works concessions, and the award of services concessions with a cross-border interest has been subject to the principles of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]. However, the European Parliament and the European Council issued a further Directive 2014/23/EU on the award of concession contracts &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0023&amp;from=EN Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament of the Council on the award of concession contracts]&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 February 2014 which required EU member states to introduce national legislation covering the award of concession contracts in excess of EUR 5,186,000 awarded on or after 18 April 2016.

In the UK, the threshold for concession contracts is £4,104,394.

The presiding officers of such Courts get appointed by the [[High Court]].

The High court appoints Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for every metropolitan court. The High court may also appoint Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for an area, with all or any of the powers of a Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, as may be directed by the High Court. Other than Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, there are also Metropolitan Magistrates also known as Magistrate of the first class who work as subordinates of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. Any two or more metropolitan magistrates may, subject to the rules made by the CMM, sit together as a bench. All metropolitan magistrates including the ACMMs and benches of general magistrates are subordinate to the CMM.

Divine laws are noted for their inflexibility.{{sfn|Chaniotis|1996|p=67}} Divine laws are often understood as beyond the authority of humans to change.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The introduction of interpretation into divine law is a controversial issue, since believers place high significance on adhering to the law precisely.{{sfn|Chaniotis|1996|p=75}} Opponents to the application of divine law typically deny that it is purely divine and point out human influences in the law. This element of human influence is understood as incorporating some degree of fallibility. These opponents characterize such laws as belonging to a particular cultural tradition. Adherents of divine law, on the other hand, are sometimes reluctant to adapt divine laws to [[Indigenization|cultural context]]s.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=244f}}

Divine law may be transmitted through several [[Media (communication)|medium]]s. Most frequently, that are transmitted through [[religious text]]s.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Medieval Christianity understood there to be three kinds of laws: divine law, [[natural law]], and man-made law.{{sfn|Anghie|1996|p=323}} Others, on the other hand, understand natural law as a subset of divine law delivered through [[general revelation]] from a [[creator deity]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} Theologians have substantially debated the scope of natural law, with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] encouraging greater use of [[reason]] and expanding the scope of natural law and marginalizing divine law in a process of [[secularization]].{{sfn|Anghie|1996|p=323f}}{{Additional citation needed|date=May 2018|reason=Anghie doesn't say everything said here.}} Some people may understand themselves as receiving guidance through [[prayer]] or [[conscience]], although the moral authority of these methods of transmission are much lower.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Since the authority of divine law is rooted in its source, the origin and transmission history of divine law are important.{{sfn | Weiss | 2010 |loc=Part II. The Indicators of God’s Law}}{{efn|See, for example, in Judaism [[Biblical Mount Sinai]], [[Shavuot#Giving of the Torah]], [[Yitro (parsha)]], and the [[Letter of Aristeas]].}}

There are frequently conflicts between [[secular]] understandings of [[justice]] or [[morality]] and divine law.{{sfn|Chaniotis|1996|p=66,69}}

[[Religious law]], such as [[canon law]], includes both divine law and additional interpretations, logical extensions, and traditions.{{sfn|Molano|2009|p=212}}

==Thomas Aquinas==
{{main|Treatise on Law}}
In [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', divine law comes only from revelation or [[scripture]], hence [[biblical law]], and is necessary for human [[salvation]]. According to Aquinas, divine law must not be confused with natural law. Divine law is mainly and mostly natural law, but it can also be [[positive law]].

'''Erhard Blankenburg''' (October 30, 1938 – March 28, 2018) was a German sociologist, specializing in the [[sociology of law]].
[[File:Erhard Blankenburg.jpg|thumb|Erhard Blankenburg (2013)]]

== Education and Career ==
Blankenburg studied philosophy, sociology and German literature at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the Free University Berlin. He received an MA from the University of Oregon (1965) and a PhD (D.Phil.) from the University of Basel (1966). After working as an assistant to the sociologist [[Heinrich Popitz]] at the University of Freiburg (1966-1968), he received there his [[habilitation]] (1974). From 1975 to 1980, Blankenburg worked at the renowned [[Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung|Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin]]. In 1980 he became professor of sociology of law at the [[Free University Amsterdam]]

In the 1970s, he was, along with [[Wolfgang Kaupen]], [[Rüdiger Lautmann]] and [[Volkmar Gessner]], instrumental in reviving sociology of law in Germany. There, he was among the founders of the "Zeitschrift für Rechtssoziologie", still the leading journal in the German socio-legal community. He also played a role in establishing the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]]. In 1991, together with [[Bill Felstiner]], he organized the first joint meeting of the [[Law and Society Association]] and the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]], the two leading organizations of socio-legal scholars in Amsterdam. His research covered a broad range of socio-legal topics, with an interest in describing and comparing legal cultures at the centre.

In 2005, Blankenburg received, at the annual conference of the Research Committee on Sociology of Law in Paris, the [[Adam Podgórecki]] Prize "for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research".
"Blankenburg has given us an important body of work. It is work that is (and should be) extremely influential in the field; and no respectable sociologist of law  can afford to ignore it. For this he deserves out thanks and our congratulation" (Friedman 1998, 386).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2614">An '''examination support document''' ('''ESD''') was a submission formerly proposed to be required to be made to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] by an applicant for a United States [[patent]] under certain circumstances.  An ESD would be required to comprise at least:
*A statement that a [[prior art]] search was done including the fields of search and search logic;
*A listing of the references deemed most closely related to the [[Claim (patent)|claim]]s pending in the [[patent application]];
*An identification in each reference of all of the limitations in each claim found in said reference.
*A detailed explanation pointing out how each independent claim is allowable over the prior art; and
*A showing of where each limitation in each claim is found in the specification the patent application.

As of November 1, 2007, examination support documents were to be required for each patent application that had more than 5 independent claims or more than 25 dependent claims that had not had a first [[office action]] on the merits of its claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/notices/72fr46716.pdf “''37 CFR Part 1 Changes To Practice for Continued Examination Filings, Patent Applications Containing Patentably Indistinct Claims, and Examination of Claims in Patent Applications; Final Rule''”], Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 161 / Tuesday, August 21, 2007 / Rules and Regulations, pp 46716 – 46843 &lt;/ref&gt;

Examination support documents were controversial. Many [[patent attorney|US patent agents or attorneys]] felt that they would force an inventor to, in essence, examine his or her own application.  Others felt that they would help speed up patent examination and improve patent quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2007/09/uspto-guideline.html#comments “USPTO Guidelines for Examination Support Documents (ESD)” Patently O blog and comments.  Original posting September 13, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirement never came into effect because of a preliminary injunction&lt;ref name="deferred"&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41261.pdf "Deferred Examination of Patent Applications: Implications for Innovation Policy," Congressional Research Service]&lt;/ref&gt; and was abolished effective October 14, 2009.&lt;ref name="deferred" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-10-14/pdf/E9-24667.pdf 74 FR 52686, Changes to Practice for Continued Examination Filings, Patent Applications Containing Patentably Indistinct Claims, and Examination of Claims in Patent Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Good law''' is the concept in [[case law|jurisprudence]] that a legal decision is still valid. That is, that a decision has not been overturned (during an [[appeal]]) or otherwise rendered obsolete (such as by a change in the underlying law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Cite Checking"|url=http://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/researchLitigation/LegalResearch/CiteChecking.asp|website=National Paralegal College|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Prerogative writs}}
'''''Habeas corpus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|b|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|ɔr|p|ə|s}}; [[Medieval Latin]] meaning literally "that you have the body")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=habeas corpus|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habeas%20corpus|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Legal recourse|recourse in law]] through which a person can report an [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|unlawful detention or imprisonment]] to a [[court]] and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Habeas Corpus|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/habeas_corpus.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=English|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is known as "the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;per Blackstone&lt;/ref&gt; It is a summons with the force of a [[court order]]; it is addressed to the custodian (a prison official, for example) and demands that a prisoner be taken before the court, and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. If the custodian is acting beyond his or her authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on his or her behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of ''habeas corpus''. One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]]. Most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not always called ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution|first=Albert|last=Venn Dicey|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kz40AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=INTRODUCTION+TO+THE+STUDY+OF+THE+LAW+OF+THE+CONSTITUTION+A.+V.+Dicey|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the ''[[amparo de libertad]]'' ("protection of freedom").

''Habeas corpus'' has certain limitations. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The applicant must make out a ''prima facie'' case. However, once that is done, the applicant is entitled to the writ as of right, which is then granted ''ex debito justitae'' ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right)&lt;/ref&gt; It is technically only a procedural [[legal remedy|remedy]]; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then ''habeas corpus'' may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or [[state of emergency]].{{elucidate|date=February 2016}}

The right to petition for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' has nonetheless long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. The jurist [[Albert Venn Dicey]] wrote that the British [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Acts]] "declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Wright (1994) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7oOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=declare+no+principle+and+define+no+rights,+but+they+are+for+practical+purposes+worth+a+hundred+constitutional+articles+guaranteeing+individual+liberty&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=declare%20no%20principle%20and%20define%20no%20rights%2C%20but%20they%20are%20for%20practical%20purposes%20worth%20a%20hundred%20constitutional%20articles%20guaranteeing%20individual%20liberty ''Citizens and subjects: an essay on British politics''], Routledge, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is one of what are called the "extraordinary", "[[common law]]", or "[[prerogative writ]]s", which were historically issued by the [[English courts]] in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.

==Etymology==
From Latin ''habeas'', 2nd person singular present [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] active of ''habere'', "to have", "to hold"; and ''corpus'', accusative singular of ''corpus'', "body". In reference to more than one person, ''habeas corpora''.

Literally, the phrase means "[we command] that you should have the [detainee's] body [brought to court]". The complete phrase ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' means "that you have the person for the purpose of subjecting him/her to (examination)". These are the opening words of writs in 14th century Anglo-French documents requiring a person to be brought before a court or judge, especially to determine if that person is being legally detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=habeas corpus |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=habeas%20corpus |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarly named writs===
The full name of the writ is often used to distinguish it from similar ancient writs, also named ''habeas corpus''. These include:
* ''Habeas corpus ad deliberandum et recipiendum'': a writ for bringing an accused from a different county into a court in the place where a crime had been committed for purposes of trial, or more literally to return holding the body for purposes of "deliberation and receipt" of a decision. ("[[Extradition]]")
* ''Habeas corpus ad faciendum et recipiendum'' (also called ''habeas corpus cum causa''): a writ of a superior court to a custodian to return with the body being held by the order of a lower court "with reasons", for the purpose of "receiving" the decision of the superior court and of "doing" what it ordered.
* ''Habeas corpus ad prosequendum'': a writ ordering return with a prisoner for the purpose of "prosecuting" him before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad respondendum'': a writ ordering return to allow the prisoner to "answer" to new proceedings before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad testificandum'': a writ ordering return with the body of a prisoner for the purposes of "testifying".

==Origins in England==
{{further|English law}}
''Habeas corpus'' originally stems from the [[Assize of Clarendon]], a re-issuance of rights during the reign of [[Henry II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/assizecl.asp |title=Assize of Clarendon, 1166. |date=1 December 1998 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the foundations for ''habeas corpus'' were "wrongly thought" to have originated in [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ralph V. ''Magna Carta'' Pearson (2003) p162 and p219&lt;/ref&gt; This charter declared that:{{quote|No [[Estates of the realm|Freeman]] shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]], or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land.}}

[[William Blackstone]] cites the first recorded usage of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' in 1305, during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, other [[writ]]s were issued with the same effect as early as the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]] in the 12th century. Blackstone explained the basis of the writ, saying "[t]he king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackstone |first1=William |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of the First Edition of 1765-1769, vol. 3, pp. 129-37 |date=1768 |publisher=University of Chicago Press (1979), reproduced in ''The Founders' Constitution,'' Volume 3, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, Document 4 |location=Chicago |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_9_2s4.html |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure for issuing a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was first codified by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A previous law (the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]]) had been passed forty years earlier to overturn a ruling that the command of the King was a sufficient answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Maxwell. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/canbarev18&amp;div=24 Habeas Corpus Cum Causa-The Emergence of the Modern Writ-II.] Can. B. Rev. 18 (1940): 172, 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone purpose of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''writ of habeas corpus'' was to limit the King's Chancery's ability to undermine the surety of law by allowing courts of justice decisions to be overturned in favor and application of ''equity'', a process managed by the Chancelor (a bishop) with the King'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/public_education/05_mar08_habeascorpus_landman.pdf|title=Understanding Habeas Corpus|last=Landman|first=James|date=|website=American Bar Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1679 codification of ''habeas corpus'' took place in the context of a [[Exclusion crisis|sharp confrontation]] between King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the [[British Parliament|Parliament]], which was dominated by the then sharply oppositional, nascent [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]]. The Whig leaders had good reasons to fear the King moving against them through the courts (as indeed happened in 1681) and regarded ''habeas corpus'' as safeguarding their own persons. The short-lived Parliament which made this enactment came to be known as the ''[[Habeas Corpus Parliament]]'' - being dissolved by the King immediately afterwards.

Then, as now, the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued by a superior court in the name of the Sovereign, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the royal courts of law. A ''habeas corpus'' petition could be made by the prisoner him or herself or by a third party on his or her behalf and, as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts, could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge. Since the 18th century the writ has also been used in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in ''[[Somersett's Case]]'' (1772), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to be freed.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Charles Moncreiff (2006). "The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar", pp.85–86. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; During that case, these famous words are said to have been uttered: "The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it".&lt;ref&gt;George Birkbeck Hil (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2EQCXQ0IbUkC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=The+air+of+England+has+long+been+too+pure+for+a+slave,+and+every+man+is+free+who+breathes+it.&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20air%20of%20England%20has%20long%20been%20too%20pure%20for%20a%20slave%2C%20and%20every%20man%20is%20free%20who%20breathes%20it. Life of Johnson, Volume 3] Kessinger Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Seven Years' War]] and later conflicts, the Writ was used on behalf of soldiers and sailors [[Impressment|pressed]] into military and naval service.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Kevin, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment 1756–1816, The Journal of Legal History 29.2 215 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816]] introduced some changes and expanded the territoriality of the legislation.

The privilege of ''habeas corpus'' has been suspended or restricted several times during [[English history]], most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two [[World War]]s and the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the ''habeas corpus'' procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as ''habeas corpus'' is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention is in accordance with an [[Act of Parliament]], the petition for ''habeas corpus'' is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtrights/128/12807.htm Joint Committee On Human Rights Sixteenth Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' implies that the prisoner is brought to the court for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined. However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the original application to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or [[bail]]ed by order of the court without having to be produced before it. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications for [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Re (Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599; Re B [1991] 1 FLR 106&lt;/ref&gt; The writ, however, maintains its vigour, and was held by the UK Supreme Court to be available in respect of a prisoner captured by British forces in Afghanistan, albeit that the Secretary of State made a valid return to the writ justifying the detention of the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v Rahmatullah]] [2012] UKSC 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other jurisdictions==
===Australia===
The writ of ''habeas corpus'' as a procedural remedy is part of [[Australia]]'s English law inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, David and Gerard McCoy (1998), "Habeas Corpus" (Federation Press)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Australian parliament]] passed the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]]. Some legal experts questioned the constitutionality of the act, due in part to limitations it placed on ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Human Rights Guide to Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/human-rights-guide-australias-counter-terrorism-laws|website=Australian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCOZ&gt;{{cite web|title=National security and anti-terrorism laws in Australia|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/medialaw_in_australia_06.html|website=The News Manual|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rix|first1=Mark|title=Australia's Anti-Terrorism Legislation - The national security state and the community legal sector.|journal=Research Online - University of Wollongong|date=2006|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=gsbpapers|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
''Habeas corpus'' rights are part of the British legal tradition inherited by Canada. The rights exist in the common law but have been enshrined in the [[Constitution Act 1982]], under [[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section Ten]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html |title=The Constitution Act, 1982; Part I, Section 10(c): Legal Rights |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This states that "Everyone has the right on arrest or detention&amp;nbsp;... (c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of ''habeas corpus'' and to be released if the detention is not lawful".

Suspension of the writ in Canadian history occurred famously during the [[October Crisis]], during which the [[War Measures Act]] was invoked by the [[Governor General of Canada]] on the [[Advice (constitutional)|constitutional advice]] of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], who had received a request from the [[Quebec]] Cabinet. The Act was also used to justify German, Slavic, and [[Ukrainian Canadian internment]] during the [[First World War]], and the internment of German-Canadians, Italian-Canadians and [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese-Canadians]] during the [[Second World War]]. The writ was suspended for several years following the [[Battle of Fort Erie (1866)]] during the [[Fenian Rising]], though the suspension was only ever applied to suspects in the [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/033001/f2/033001-1402.7-e.pdf |title=The Fenians in Canada |author=David A. Wilson |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ is available where there is no other adequate remedy. However, a superior court always has the discretion to grant the writ even in the face of an alternative remedy (see ''May v Ferndale Institution'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=May v Ferndale Institution |link= |year=2005 |court=scc |num=82 |parallelcite=[2005] 3 SCR 809 |date=2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] the writ is largely unavailable if a statutory right of appeal exists, whether or not this right has been exercised.

===France===
A fundamental human right in the "1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]" drafted by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/marquis-de-lafayette|title=Marquis de Lafayette|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guarantees against arbitrary detention are enshrined in the French Constitution and regulated by the Penal Code. The safeguards are equivalent to those found under the Habeas-Corpus provisions found in Germany, the United States and several Commonwealth countries. The French system of accountability prescribes severe penalties for ministers, police officers and civil and judiciary authorities who either violate or fail to enforce the law.

"Article 7 of [1789] Declaration also provides that 'No individual may be accused, arrested, or detained except where the law so prescribes, and in accordance with the procedure it has laid down.' ... The Constitution further states that 'No one may be arbitrarily detained. The judicial authority, guardian of individual liberty, ensures the observance of this principle under the condition specified by law.' Its article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances under which people may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards in case of detention. In particular, it states that 'anyone deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/france.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: France - Author - Nicole Atwill, Senior Foreign Law Specialist|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|date=2009|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France and the United States played a synergistic role in the international team, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, which crafted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The French judge and Nobel Peace Laureate [[René Cassin]] produced the first draft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |title="A World Made New, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" de Mary Ann GLENDON - Author Emmanuel Decaux |publisher=Le Centre de recherche sur les droits de l'homme et le droit humanitaire, CRDH, Université Panthéon-Assas |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714114736/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: History of The Document |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against arbitrary detentions. René Cassin and the French team subsequently championed the ''habeas corpus'' provisions enshrined in the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-european-history/rene-cassin-and-human-rights-great-war-universal-declaration?format=HB |title=René Cassin and Human Rights: From the Great War to the Universal Declaration - Authors - Jay Winter, Antoine Prost |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany has constitutional guarantees against improper detention and these have been implemented in statutory law in a manner that can be considered as equivalent to writs of habeas corpus.

Article 104, paragraph 1 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides that deprivations of liberty may be imposed only on the basis of a specific enabling statute that also must include procedural rules. Article 104, paragraph 2 requires that any arrested individual be brought before a judge by the end of the day following the day of the arrest. For those detained as criminal suspects, article 104, paragraph 3 specifically requires that the judge must grant a hearing to the suspect in order to rule on the detention.

Restrictions on the power of the authorities to arrest and detain individuals also emanate from article 2 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law which guarantees liberty and requires a statutory authorization for any deprivation of liberty. In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which guarantees equality.

In particular, a constitutional obligation to grant remedies for improper detention is required by article 19, paragraph 4 of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: "Should any person's right be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/germany.php |title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Germany&amp;#124;Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= March 2009|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Indian judiciary, in a catena of cases, has effectively resorted to the writ of ''habeas corpus'' to secure release of a person from illegal detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baxi |first1=Pratiksha (April 2009 - Reprint 2012) |title=Habeas Corpus Juridical Narratives of Sexual Governance |url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |publisher=Centre for the Study of Law and Governance Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006125237/http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in October 2009, the Karnataka High Court heard a ''habeas corpus'' petition filed by the parents of a girl who married a Muslim boy from Kannur district and was allegedly confined in a ''madrasa'' in Malapuram town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/love-jihad-court-unhappy-with-probe/article169724.ece|title='Love Jihad': court unhappy with probe|date=27 Oct 2009|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, in most other jurisdictions, the writ is directed at police authorities. The extension to non-state authorities has its grounds in two cases: the 1898 [[Queen's Bench]] case of ''[[Ex Parte]] [[Proctor#Disciplinary functions|Daisy Hopkins]]'', wherein the Proctor of Cambridge University did detain and arrest Hopkins without his jurisdiction, and Hopkins was released,&lt;ref&gt;''Exparte, Hopkins'' (Daisy) (1891) 56 JP 262; 61 LJQB 240&lt;/ref&gt; and that of ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'', in which an African slave whose master had moved to London was freed by action of the writ.

The Indian judiciary has dispensed with the traditional doctrine of ''[[locus standi]]'', so that if a detained person is not in a position to file a petition, it can be moved on his behalf by any other person. The scope of ''habeas'' relief has expanded in recent times by actions of the Indian judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/wha.htm |title=Writ Of Habeas Corpus For Securing Liberty - Author - ABS-CBN News |publisher=Legalserviceindia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the ''habeas'' writ was used in the [[Rajan case]], a student victim of torture in local police custody during the nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] in India. On 12 March 2014, [[Subrata Roy]]'s counsel approached the Chief Justice moving a ''habeas corpus'' petition. It was also filed by the Panthers Party to protest the imprisonment of [[Anna Hazare]], a social activist.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the writ of ''habeas corpus'' is available at common law and under the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' is also guaranteed by Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 constitution]].

The article guarantees that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law" and outlines a specific procedure for the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] to enquire into the lawfulness of any person's detention. It does not mention the Latin term, ''habeas corpus'', but includes the English phrase "produce the body".

Article 40.4.2° provides that a prisoner, or anyone acting on his behalf, may make a complaint to the High Court (or to any High Court judge) of unlawful detention. The court must then investigate the matter "forthwith" and may order that the defendant bring the prisoner before the court and give reasons for his detention. The court must immediately release the detainee unless it is satisfied that he is being held lawfully. The remedy is available not only to prisoners of the state, but also to persons unlawfully detained by any private party. However the constitution provides that the procedure is not binding on the [[Irish Defence Forces|Defence Forces]] during a state of war or armed rebellion.

The full text of Article 40.4.2° is as follows: {{quote|Upon complaint being made by or on behalf of any person to the High Court or any judge thereof alleging that such person is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made shall forthwith enquire into the said complaint and may order the person in whose custody such person is detained to ''produce the body'' of such person before the High Court on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance with the law. [''Italics'' added]}}

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' continued as part of the Irish law when the state seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' was also guaranteed by Article 6 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], enacted in 1922. That article used similar wording to Article 40.4 of the current constitution, which replaced it 1937.

The relationship between the Article 40 and the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816 is ambiguous, and Forde and Leonard write that "The extent if any to which Art 40.4 has replaced these Acts has yet to be determined". In ''The State (Ahern) v Cotter'' (1982) Walsh J opined that the ancient writ referred to in the Habeas Corpus Acts remains in existence in Irish law as a separate remedy from that provided for in Article 40.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Forde, David Leonard, ''Constitutional Law of Ireland'', 2013, pp. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Article 40 procedure was restricted by the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. Prior to the amendment, a prisoner had the constitutional right to apply to any [[High Court of the Republic of Ireland|High Court]] judge for an enquiry into her detention, and to as many High Court judges as she wished. If the prisoner successfully challenged her detention before the High Court she was entitled to immediate, unconditional release.

The Second Amendment provided that a prisoner has only the right to apply to a single judge, and, once a writ has been issued, the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel of three judges who will decide the case. If the High Court finds that the prisoner's detention is unlawful due to the unconstitutionality of a law the judge must refer the matter to the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and until the Supreme's Court's decision is rendered the prisoner may be released only on bail.

The power of the state to detain persons prior to trial was extended by the [[Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Sixteenth Amendment]], in 1996. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the ''O'Callaghan'' case that the constitution required that an individual charged with a crime could be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes while on bail in the past.

===Italy===
The right to freedom from arbitrary detention is guaranteed by Article 13 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Personal liberty is inviolable. No one may be detained, inspected, or searched nor otherwise subjected to any restriction of personal liberty except by order of the Judiciary stating a reason and only in such cases and in such manner as provided by the law. In exceptional circumstances and under such conditions of necessity and urgency as shall conclusively be defined by the law, the police may take provisional measures that shall be referred within 48 hours to the Judiciary for validation and which, in default of such validation in the following 48 hours, shall be revoked and considered null and void. Any act of physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction of personal liberty shall be punished. The law shall establish the maximum duration of preventive detention.}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the remedy of ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed by the federal constitution, although not by name. Article 5(2) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] provides that "Where complaint is made to a High Court or any judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained the court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the court and release him".

As there are several statutes, for example, the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]], that still permit detention without trial, the procedure is usually effective in such cases only if it can be shown that there was a procedural error in the way that the detention was ordered.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], ''habeas corpus'' may be invoked against the government or private individuals. In 2006, a child was allegedly kidnapped by his maternal grandfather after a custody dispute. The father began ''habeas corpus'' proceedings against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child. The mother did not present the child to the court and so was imprisoned for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10407667|title=New Zealand Herald newspaper|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz|date=2006-10-26|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released when the grandfather came forward with the child in late January 2007.

===Pakistan===
Issuance of a writ is an exercise of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|1973 Constitution]] of the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]], specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words "in an unlawful manner" implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/pakistan.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Pakistan|work=loc.gov|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
In the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it".

In 1971, after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]], the Marcos administration, under [[Ferdinand Marcos]], suspended ''habeas corpus'' in an effort to stifle the oncoming insurgency, having blamed the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Filipino Communist Party]] for the events of August 21. Many considered this to be a prelude to [[martial law]]. After widespread protests, however, the Arroyo administration decided to reintroduce the writ. In December 2009, ''habeas corpus'' was suspended in Maguindanao as the province was placed under martial law. This occurred in response to the [[Maguindanao massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andoybarrios on Sat, 12/05/2009 - 23:08|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/04/09/arroyo-orders-martial-law-maguindanao|title=Arroyo proclaims martial law in Maguindanao - ABS-CBN News Online|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|date=2009-12-05|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] said he was planning on suspending the habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/152167-duterte-suspend-writ-habeas-corpus-warning|title=Duterte to suspend writ of habeas corpus if 'forced'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2017 at 10&amp;nbsp;pm Philippine time, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao including Sulu and Tawi-tawi for the period of 60 days due to the series of attacks mounted by the [[Maute group]], an ISIS-linked terrorist organization. The declaration suspends the writ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/23/1703088/duterte-declares-martial-law-mindanao|title=Duterte declares martial law in Mindanao|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a law to have the same effect as ''habeas corpus'' in the 18th century. This is now known as the Criminal Procedure Act 1701 c.6.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519689 Full text of the Act]. This law was given its current short title by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "the Act for preventing wrongful imprisonment and against undue delays in trials". It is still in force although certain parts have been repealed.

===Spain===
The present [[Constitution of Spain]] states that "A ''habeas corpus'' procedure shall be provided for by law to ensure the immediate handing over to the judicial authorities of any person illegally arrested". The statute which regulates the procedure is the ''Law of Habeas Corpus of 24 May 1984'', which provides that a person imprisoned may, on her or his own or through a third person, allege that she or he is imprisoned unlawfully and request to appear before a judge. The request must specify the grounds on which the detention is considered to be unlawful, which can be, for example, that the custodian holding the prisoner does not have the legal authority, that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been violated, or that he has been subjected to mistreatment. The judge may then request additional information if needed, and may issue a ''habeas corpus'' order, at which point the custodian has 24 hours to bring the prisoner before the judge.

Historically, many of the territories of Spain had remedies equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'', such as the privilege of ''manifestación'' in the [[Crown or Aragon]] or the right of the Tree in [[Biscay]].

===United States===
{{Main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}
&lt;!-- This section is only a BRIEF SUMMARY. Please consider adding extra material to the main article instead! --&gt;
The United States inherited ''habeas corpus'' from the [[English common law]]. In England, the writ was issued in the name of the monarch. When the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] declared independence, and became a republic based on popular sovereignty, any person, in the name of the people, acquired authority to initiate such writs. The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] specifically includes the ''habeas'' procedure in the [[Suspension Clause]] (Clause 2), located in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 9. This states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it".

The writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a civil, not criminal, ''[[ex parte]]'' proceeding in which a court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, ''habeas corpus'' proceedings are to determine whether the court that imposed sentence on the defendant had jurisdiction and authority to do so, or whether the defendant's sentence has expired. ''Habeas corpus'' is also used as a legal avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or detention by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] pursuant to a deportation proceeding.

Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]] suspended ''habeas corpus'' during the Civil War and Reconstruction for some places or types of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/historicdocuments/a/lincolnhabeas.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's 1862 Proclamation Suspending Habeas Corpus |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70261 |title=Ulysses S. Grant: Proclamation 204 – Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the County of Union, South Carolina |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] suspended habeas corpus. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] attempted to place [[Guantanamo Bay]] detainees outside of the jurisdiction of ''habeas corpus'', but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned this action in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''.

==Equivalent remedies==
===Biscay===
In 1526, the ''Fuero Nuevo of the Señorío de Vizcaya'' (''New Charter of the Lordship of Biscay'') established a form of ''habeas corpus'' in the territory of the ''[[Lord of Biscay|Señorío de Vizcaya]]'', nowadays part of [[Spain]]. This revised version of the ''Fuero Viejo'' (Old Charter) of 1451 codified the medieval custom whereby no person could be arbitrarily detained without being summoned first to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]], an ancestral oak tree located in the outskirts of [[Gernika]] under which all laws of the Lordship of Biscay were passed.

The New Charter formalised that no one could be detained without a court order (Law 26 of Chapter 9) nor due to debts (Law 3 of Chapter 16). It also established that no one could be arrested without previously having been summoned to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]] and given 30 days to answer the said summon, and that upon presenting themselves under the Tree, they had to be provided with all evidence and accusations so that they could defend themselves (Law 7 of Chapter 9). No one could be sent to prison or deprived of their freedom until being formally trialed, and no one could be accused of a different crime until their current court trial was over (Law 5 of Chapter 5). Those fearing they were being arrested illegally could appeal to the ''Regimiento General'' that their rights could be upheld. The ''Regimiento'' (the executive arm of the [[Juntas Generales]] of Biscay) would demand the prisoner be handed over to them, and thereafter the prisoner would be released and placed under the protection of the Regimiento while awaiting for trial.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown of Aragon===
The [[Crown of Aragon]] also had a remedy equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'' called the ''manifestación de personas'' (literally, ''demonstration of persons'').&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Giesey, If not, not: The Oath of the Aragonese and the Legendary Laws of Sobrarbe. Princeton University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; According to the right of ''manifestación'', the [[Justicia de Aragon]] (lit. ''Justice of Aragon'', an Aragonese judiciary figure similar to an [[ombudsman]], but with far reaching executive powers) could require a judge, a court of justice, or any other official that they handed over to the ''Justicia'' (i.e., that they ''demonstrated'') anyone being prosecuted so as to guarantee that this person's rights were upheld, and that no violence would befall this person prior to him being sentenced.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"&gt;Tomás y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en España (2ª edición). Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ''Justicia'' retained the right to examine the judgement and decide whether it satisfied the conditions of a fair trial; if the ''Justicia'' was not satisfied, he could refuse to hand the accused back to the authorities. The right of ''manifestación'' acted like an habeas corpus: knowing that the appeal to the ''Justicia'' would immediately follow any unlawful detention, these were effectively illegal. Equally, [[torture]] (which had been banned since 1325 in Aragon) could never take place.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt; In some cases, people exerting their right of manifestación were kept under the Justicia's watch in ''manifestación'' prisons (famous for their mild and easy conditions) or house arrest; more generally however, the person was released from confinement and placed under the ''Justicia's protection'', awaiting trial. The ''Justicia'' always granted the right of ''manifestación'' by default, but they only really had to act in extreme cases, as for instance famously happened in 1590 when [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]], the disgraced secretary to [[Philip II of Spain]], fled from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] to Aragon and used his Aragonese ascendency to appeal to the ''Justicia'' for manifestación right, and therefore prevent his arrest at the King's behest.

The right of ''manifestación'' was codified in 1325 in the [[Declaratio Privilegii generalis]] passed by the [[Aragonese Corts]] under king [[James II of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;González Antón, Luis, ''Las Uniones aragonesas y las Cortes del Reino (1283-1301)'', Zaragoza, Escuela de Estudios Medievales; CSIC; Librería General, 1975. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04150-2}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=sIYVCrzY8-4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage Vol I. Texto]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04151-9}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=FVbKFaPne8sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage Vol. II. Documentos]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been practiced since the inception of the kingdom of Aragon in the 11th century, and therefore predates the ''habeas corpus'' itself.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt;

===Poland===
In 1430, King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland granted the Privilege of [[Jedlnia]], which proclaimed, ''[[Neminem captivabimus]] nisi iure victum'' ("We will not imprison anyone except if convicted by law"). This revolutionary innovation in civil [[libertarianism]] gave Polish citizens due process-style rights that did not exist in any other European country for another 250 years. Originally, the Privilege of Jedlnia was restricted to the nobility (the [[szlachta]]), but it was extended to cover townsmen in the [[Constitution of 3rd May|1791 Constitution]]. Importantly, social classifications in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not as rigid as in other European countries; townspeople and Jews were sometimes ennobled. The Privilege of Jedlnia provided broader coverage than many subsequently enacted habeas corpus laws because Poland's nobility constituted an unusually large percentage of the country's total population, which was Europe's largest. As a result, by the 16th century, it was protecting the liberty of between five hundred thousand and a million Poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indylaw.indiana.edu/instructors/cole/web%20page/polconst.pdf Poland's 1997 Constitution in Its Historical Context]; Daniel H. Cole, Indiana University School of Law, September 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman-Dutch law===
In [[South Africa]] and other countries whose legal systems are based on [[Roman-Dutch law]], the ''[[interdictum de homine libero exhibendo]]'' is the equivalent of the writ of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murdoch |last=Watney |title=Arrest, detention and the ''interdictum de homine libero exhibendo'' |journal=Journal of South African Law |volume=2011 |year=2011 |number=3 |pages=555–562 |url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/electronic_journals/ju_tsar/ju_tsar_2011_n3_a10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, it has been entrenched in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], which provides in section 35(2)(d) that every detained person has the right to challenge the lawfulness of the detention in person before a court and, if the detention is unlawful, to be released.

==World ''habeas corpus''==
In the 1950s, American lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] began advocating an international writ of ''habeas corpus'' to protect individual human rights. In 1952, he filed a petition for a "United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus" on behalf of [[William N. Oatis]], an American journalist jailed the previous year by the Communist government of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;The petition was titled "United Nations Ex Rel., Luis Kutner, For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, Petitioner, v. Czechoslovakia, Respondent - Petition of Luis Kutner For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, For a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus." See [http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf Vicki C. Jackson, "World Habeas Corpus", 91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309 (January 2006).] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Czechoslovakia had violated Oatis's rights under the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had "inherent power" to fashion remedies for human rights violations, the petition was filed with the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf|format=PDF|first=Vicki C. |last=Jackson|title=World Habeas Corpus |volume=91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309-314 |year=January 2006|website=cornelllawreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission forwarded the petition to Czechoslovakia, but no other United Nations action was taken.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; Oatis was released in 1953. Kutner went on to publish numerous articles and books advocating the creation of an "International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;ref&gt;His first article was "A Proposal for a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus and International Court of Human Rights", Tulane Law Review, 28 (June 1954): 417-441. See also, Luis Kutner, ''World Habeas Corpus'', Dobbs Ferry, NY: Oceana, 1962, p. 266, for his draft of a "Treaty-Statute of the International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights standards==
Article 3 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that "everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person". [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] goes further and calls for persons detained to have the right to challenge their detention, providing at article 5.4: {{quote|Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.}}

'''Immigration law''' refers to the national [[statute]]s, [[Primary and secondary legislation|regulations]], and [[Precedent|legal precedents]] governing [[immigration]] into and [[deportation]] from a [[country]]. Strictly speaking, it is distinct from other matters such as [[naturalization]] and [[citizenship]], although they are often conflated. Immigration laws vary around the world, as well as according to the [[Society|social]] and [[political climate]] of the times, as acceptance of immigrants sways from the widely inclusive to the deeply [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]]. Countries frequently maintain laws which regulate both the rights of entry and exit as well as internal rights, such as the duration of stay, [[freedom of movement]], and the right to participate in [[commerce]] or [[government]].

National laws regarding the immigration of citizens of that country are regulated by [[international law]]. The [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] mandates&lt;ref&gt;art 12(4)&lt;/ref&gt; that all countries allow entry to their own citizens.

==Control measures==
To control immigration, many countries set up customs at entry points.  Some common location for entry points are airports and roads near the border.  At the customs department, [[travel document]]s are inspected.  Some required documents are a [[passport]], an [[Carte Jaune|international certificate of vaccination]] and an [[onward ticket]].  Sometimes travelers are also required to declare or register the amount of money they are carrying.

'''Injustice''' is a quality relating to unfairness or undeserved outcomes. The term may be applied in reference to a particular event or situation, or to a larger [[status quo]]. In [[Western philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]], injustice is very commonly—but not always—defined as  either the absence or the opposite of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. Textbook on Jurisprudence. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Simon" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze" /&gt;

The sense of injustice is a universal human feature, though the exact circumstances considered unjust can vary from culture to culture. While even acts of nature can sometimes arouse the sense of injustice, the sense is usually felt in relation to human action such as misuse, [[abuse]], neglect, or malfeasance that is uncorrected or else sanctioned by a [[legal system]] or fellow human beings.

The sense of injustice can be a powerful motivational condition, causing people to take action not just to defend themselves but also others who they perceive to be unfairly treated.

==Relationship with justice==
Professor [[Judith N. Shklar|Judith Shklar]] has written that Western philosophers tend to spend much more time discussing the concept of 'justice' rather than 'injustice'. On the other hand, she states both historical writing and fiction use instances of injustice as subject matter far more often than justice.&lt;ref name = "Judith" /&gt;

In philosophy and jurisprudence, the dominant view has been that injustice and justice are two sides of the same coin—that injustice is simply a lack of justice.  This view has been challenged by professors including Judith Shklar, Thomas W Simon and [[Eric Heinze]], who consider that justice and injustice are independent qualities. So, in this minority view, you can increase the justice of a situation without reducing the injustice. Heinze has even gone as far as to argue that an increase in justice can actually cause an increase in injustice.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;

A relatively common view among philosophers and other writers is that while justice and injustice may be interdependent, it is injustice that is the primary quality. Many writers have written that, while it is hard to directly define or even perceive justice, it is easy to demonstrate that injustice can be perceived by all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

According to [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]], the earliest known thinker to state that injustice is the primary quality was [[Heraclitus]],  whose view was echoed by [[Aristotle]] and dozens of others down the centuries. Hayek said that writers often express the idea that injustice is the primary concept "as though it were a new discovery", suggesting the view is rarely directly expressed in theories on Justice. But Hayek went on to say that [[legal positivism]] has proved that injustice, not justice, is the primary quality.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 8 "THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE"  in Vol 2 of  von Hayeks's ''The mirage of social justice'' (University of Chicago Press,  1978). For a list discussing dozens of writers who have stated down the centuries that  injustice, not justice, is the primary concept, look out for the long footnote under the sub heading  "Rules of just conduct are generally prohibitions of unjust conduct"&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars including Judith Shklar, Edmond Cahn  and [[Barrington Moore, Jr.]] have surveyed anthropological and historical work on injustice, concluding that the sense of injustice is found everywhere there are men and women; it is a [[human universal]].&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore" /&gt;    
These writers, and others like [[Simone Weil]], Elizabeth Wolgast and Thomas W Simon, hold that the sense of injustice is a powerful motivational condition — unlike the sense of justice which tends to be conceived in more abstract ways, and tends to inspire contemplation rather than action.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Clive. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Priority_of_Injustice.html?id=_2jmAQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory'']. (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2017). {{ISBN| 978-0820351520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cahn held that, for [[evolution|evolutionary reasons]], humans who witness others being subjected to injustice can respond as though it was an act of aggression towards themselves. There can be an immediate, visceral activation of the [[fight-or-flight response|flight or fight]] system. As [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] puts it "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr., [[Letter from a Birmingham Jail]] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study published in [[Psychological Science]] found that even babies have a sense of injustice and dislike having it violated, even when they witness events that do not directly effect them.&lt;ref&gt;

In the field of jurisprudence, Cahn has argued that it is an important skill for lawyers to know how to rouse a jury's sense of injustice — something best done by appeals to the particular, not by abstractions or [[Boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] type statements.  Barrington Moore asserts that reasons why populations often submit to [[oppression]] for long periods of time is that they consider it inevitable and so their sense of injustice is not aroused. He says that a widely shared sense of injustice is an essential, though not sufficient, cause of rebellion.  Writers including Simone Weil, Elizabeth Wolgast and Judith Shklar have said that an aroused sense of injustice can be an essential prerequisite to action needed for protecting the weak and afflicted.&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast"/&gt;

==Causes==
A common cause of injustice is human selfishness. As [[Plato]] described at length in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', people will often commit acts of injustice when they calculate it is in their interests to do so.&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;  Plato also adds that "The highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not".   Human injustice is not always caused by attempt to gain unfair advantage or malice; it may be simply the result of the flawed human [[decision making]]. For example, studies have found that judges sitting on review boards are less likely to reach decisions favorable to applicants depending on how long it is since the judges had their last food break.&lt;ref&gt;"We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break." {{cite journal |author1=Shai Danzigera |author2=Jonathan Levav |author3=Liora Avnaim-Pessoa| title=Extraneous factors in judicial decisions |date=11 April 2011 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=108 |issue=17 |pages=6889–92 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1018033108 |pmid=21482790 | accessdate=15 November 2011|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.6889D |pmc=3084045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on the substantial difference in judges' decisions depending on time since last food break, see chpt 3 of [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Misuse and abuse with regard to a particular case or context may represent a systemic failure to serve the cause of justice (cf. [[Non liquet|legal vacuum]]).&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.&lt;ref name=statutory/&gt;

==History==
===Rise of jury sentencing===
The impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Virginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution_of_Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas_Jefferson#Minister_to_France|Jefferson was in France]].&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Sentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should "suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776-1845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

The adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

During the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The 
change to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.&lt;ref name=grab/&gt;

Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

===Decline of jury sentencing===
The 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

These systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults. In the prison system, [[parole commission]]ers, trained in penology and insulated from political pressures, determined when prisoners had been rehabilitated and could be reintegrated into society.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

The process of preparing a presentence report, which takes weeks, only begins after the defendant is convicted, since if he/she were to be acquitted, the effort that went into preparing the report would be wasted. It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

Furthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.&lt;ref name=statutory&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134-1172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of a intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.

Georgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937-1939, and from 1913-1923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]]. By 1919, fourteen states gave juries sentencing powers in non-capital cases, although by 1960, that number had dropped to thirteen.&lt;ref name=democratic&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice|author=Iontcheva, Jenia|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=89|number=2|date=April 2003|pages=311-383|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3202435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, [[determinate sentencing]], a new intellectual current that repudiated the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]] model with its focus on using mathematical models and grids to determine sentences, had made inroads, making jury sentencing seem like more of an anachronism.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Georgia permanently abandoned jury sentencing in 1974 and Tennessee did the same in 1982.&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Nancy J.|title=The Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing in the United States|volume=78|journal=Chi.-Kent L. Rev.|number=937|date=2003|url=https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cklawreview/vol78/iss3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota had also abandoned jury sentencing, and Mississippi was using jury sentencing only in rape and statutory rape cases. Oklahoma abolished jury sentencing but reinstated it in 1999.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

===Possible revival of jury sentencing===
According to some commentators, the time is ripe for a revival of jury sentencing, because flaws in the determinate sentencing systems are becoming increasingly apparent. Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce racial disparity in sentencing.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775-1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]]. There have been movements to abolish sentencing commissions and guideline systems and inform jurors of their right to nullify. Decisions like ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find any facts that would increase a defendant's maximum sentence) and ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find whether there are aggravating factors justifying capital punishment) have also signaled a willingness by the judiciary to expand the role of the jury in the legal process.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Jury sentencing has been seen as a way to in many cases render moot the questions raised by ''Apprendi'' and related cases such as ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'' and ''[[United States v. Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibas, Stephanos and Klein, Susan R.|title=The Sixth Amendment and Criminal Sentencing|date=2008|journal=Faculty Scholarship|number=921|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/921}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the differences between [[Element (criminal law)|elements of an offense]] and sentencing factors by letting the jury decide all the facts.&lt;ref name=applying&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying Apprendi to jury sentencing: why state felony jury sentencing threatens the right to a jury trial|author=Carrington, Melissa|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=2011|number=4|pages=1359-1385|url=http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Carrington.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases such as ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' and ''[[Graham v. Florida]]'' (banning mandatory life imprisonment without parole, and life imprisonment without parole in non-homicide cases, respectively, for juveniles, as contrary to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]]) also raise a question of whether the Supreme Court logically should allow only a jury, rather than a judge, to determine a juvenile should receive such a sentence, given the parallels between adult capital punishment case law and juvenile life imprisonment with parole case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Russell, Sarah F.|title=Jury Sentencing and Juveniles: Eighth Amendment Limits and Sixth Amendment Rights|volume=56|journal=B.C.L. Rev.|number=553|date=2015|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol56/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plea bargains, judicial override, and juror access to information==
In Virginia, under the 1796 act, capital punishment remained mandatory for [[first-degree murder]], but the penalty for [[second-degree murder]] was any term between five and eighteen years in the penitentiary. The 1796 act gave the court in murder cases the authority to "determine the degree of the crime, and to give sentence accordingly" when a defendant was "convicted by confession." The judge's discretion to set sentences in cases of confession did not exist in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In Missouri, informing juries of sentences of defendants in similar cases or the sentences of co-participants in the crime on trial is strictly prohibited under the rules of evidence." Similarly, the Kentucky [[truth in sentencing]] statute, which generally increases the information available to sentencing juries, does not provide for sentencing guidelines and statistics. Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible. The military at one time provided [[United States military jury|jurors]] with sentencing statistics and guidelines was the military, but this practice ended in the late 1950s as the military's judicial philosophy shifted its emphasis away from sentencing uniformity and towards individualized judgments. The [[United States Court of Military Appeals]] held that jurors were not to consider sentences in similar cases or to consult the sentencing manual.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Under Virginia's current system, jurors are controversially not allowed access to the Commonwealth's [[sentencing guidelines]] or to information about whether sentences will run consecutively or concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20120401-2012-04-01-dp-nws-crime-notebook-0401-20120331-story.html|date=1 April 2012|title=Virginia judges rarely question juries' sentencing recommendations|publisher=Daily Press|author=Kelly, Ashley and Dujardin, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2000 were also not informed that parole had been abolished in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/va_md_dc/virginia-eyes-new-sentences-after-juries-didn-t-get-key/article_1008cc74-de6f-5b77-bdd0-61c099dd9400.html|title=Virginia eyes new sentences after juries didn't get key fact|author=Durkin, Alana|publisher=Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must justify any departure from the jury's recommendation in writing to the [[Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission]].

J.|number=559|date=2014|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmborj/vol23/iss2/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about juries' imposing higher sentences than what the sentencing guidelines would suggest, many defendants opt either for [[bench trial]]s or [[plea bargain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of juried trials slumps both in Va., nationwide |url=https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/number-of-juried-trials-slumps-both-in-va-nationwide/article_d2dbfd5c-34cc-5d9c-b999-a9c6641783f9.html|author=Green, Frank|publisher=Daily Progress|date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States with jury sentencing have often allowed judges to intervene in the sentencing process, e.g. by reducing the sentence imposed by the jury, imposing hard labor or solitary confinement in addition to the jury's assessment of fines, or determining the place of confinement imposed by the jury.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In Alabama, judges were allowed to override juries' recommendations of life imprisonment and impose capital punishment instead, until a 2017 law took that power away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/07/death_penalty_judicial_overrid.html|title=Did judicial override end in Alabama? Some say judges can still overrule jury over death penalty|date=21 July 2017|publisher=AL.com|author=Remkus, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jury sentencing states except Texas allow the judge to fix the punishment in case the jury fails to agree on a sentence,&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; making it impossible for there to be a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]] at sentencing.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

==Arguments for and against jury sentencing==
Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;

An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.&lt;ref name=booker&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga. L. Rev.|number=897|date=2005|url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/faculty_lawreviews/131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments that have been raised against sentencing by jury are that juries are not as accountable as judges; that putting them in charge of determining both guilt and the sentence concentrates too much power in one body; and that different juries may differ widely in the sentences they impose. Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

It is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since "one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&amp;context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

An advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service. Racial and other minorities may also benefit from having greater representation among jurors than among judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

In jurisdictions that do not have any statutory provisions formally allowing jury sentencing, judges have sometimes consulted with the jury on sentencing anyway. At the federal level, the practice of polling the jury and using their input in sentencing was upheld on appeal by the [[6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/06/federal_appeals_court_upholds.html|title=Federal appeals court upholds judge's lowest possible sentence in child-porn case|author=Heisig, Eric|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence,&lt;ref name=grab&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webster, Charles W.|title=Jury Sentencing - Grab-Bag Justice|volume=14|journal=Sw L.J.|number=221|date=1960|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol14/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In [[New South Wales]], a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice [[Jim Spigelman]] to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge [[Reg Blanch]] cited "an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence". Concerns about [[jury tampering]] through intimidation by defendants were also raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/keep-juries-away-from-sentencing-say-judges-20070427-gdq067.html|title=Keep juries away from sentencing, say judges|author=Pearlman, Jonathan|date=27 April 2007|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and many other [[continental Europe]]an countries have a system in which professional judges and [[Judiciary_of_Germany#Lay_judges|lay judges]] deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time‐consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo‐American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mixed Court and Jury Court: Could the Continental Alternative Fill the American Need?|author=Langbein, John H.|date=January 1981|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1981.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable jury sentences==
Civil rights leader [[James Bevel]] was sentenced to 15 years in prison pursuant to the recommendation of a Virginia jury that found him guilty of having sex with his teenage daughter in the 1990s when they lived in Leesburg. The sentencing range had been 5 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=43768|title=Civil Rights Leader Convicted of Incest|author=Barakat, Matthew|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''law and literature''' movement focuses on the [[interdisciplinary]] connection between [[law]] and [[literature]]. This field has roots in two major developments in the intellectual history of law—first, the growing doubt about whether law in isolation is a source of value and meaning, or whether it must be plugged into a large cultural or philosophical or social-science context to give it value and meaning; and, second, the growing focus on the mutability of meaning in all texts, whether literary or legal.  Those who work in the field stress one or the other of two complementary perspectives: ''Law in literature'' (understanding enduring issues as they are explored in great literary texts) and ''law as literature'' (understanding legal texts by reference to methods of literary interpretation, analysis, and critique).

This movement has broad and potentially far reaching implications with regards to future [[teaching methods]], [[scholarship]], and [[Statutory interpretation|interpretations]] of legal texts. Combining literature's ability to provide unique insight into the [[human condition]] through text with the legal framework that regulates those human experiences in reality gives a [[democracy|democratic]] [[judiciary]] a new and dynamic approach to reaching the aims of providing a [[justice|just]] and [[morality|moral]] society. It is necessary, in practical thought and discussion about the use of legal [[rhetoric]], to understand text's role in defining human experience.

== History of the movement ==
Perhaps first to envision the movement were [[John Wigmore]] and [[Benjamin Cardozo]], who acknowledged "[[novelists]] and [[poets]]" as the principal teachers of law in the first half of the 20th century. Most scholars, however, credit [[James Boyd White]] as the founder of the law and literature movement because of the dedicated research and distinguished publications he has contributed to this rapidly growing field. Among his many literary books and articles, White's most renowned publication, ''[[The Legal Imagination]]'', is often credited with initiating the law and literature movement.  This book, first published in 1973, is a fusion of anthology and critique, superficially resembling a traditional legal casebook but drawing on a much wider and more diverse range of sources, with headnotes and questions emphasizing the relationship of legal texts to literary analysis and literary texts to the legal issues that they explore.

The movement began attracting attention in the 1970s and by the 1980s had gained substantial ground in academia. The proponents of the ''law-in-literature'' theory, such as [[Richard Weisberg]] and [[Robert Weisberg]], believe that literary works, especially [[narratives]] centered on a legal conflict, will offer [[lawyers]] and judges insight into the "[[nature of law]]" that would otherwise go missing in the traditionally strict study of legal rhetoric.

In its early stages, the law and literature movement focused strictly on the ''law in literature'' theory; however, beginning in the late 1970s the ''law as literature'' perspective began to gain popularity. This perspective seeks to enhance legal studies by examining and interpreting legal texts using the techniques of [[literary critics]]. Scholars such as White and [[Ronald Dworkin]] find greater relevance in ''law as literature'' because it maintains that the meaning of legal texts, such as [[written law]], like any other [[genre]] of literature, can only be discovered through interpretation. Although legal scholars have long considered both literary and legal texts in their study of the [[legal process]], the recent degree to which the two seemingly separate genres interact has sparked great debates among scholars.

== Law in literature ==
The law in literature view is specifically concerned with the way in which legal situations are presented in literature. Generally, they place a high value on the "independent" view from which literary writers are able to see the law. They believe that such authors have a lesson to teach legal scholars and lawyers alike about the human condition, and the law's effect on it. Such scholars tend to cite authors like [[Franz Kafka]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], and [[Charles Dickens]]. The fictional situations presented in literature, these scholars assert, can tell a great deal about political and social situations, and the individual that often find themselves before the court.  For example, [[Robert Weisberg]] believes that the law in literature offers fertile possibilities. He suggests that even though some literature cannot instruct its readers about legal situations, they can still educate law students about the human condition.

[[Richard H. Weisberg]], professor at [[Cardozo School of Law]] is another leading scholar of law and literature.  Following the lead of James Boyd White, he sees an intrinsic value in the use of literature as a means of discussing legal topics. Unlike White however, who places value on literature for its ability to stimulate critical thought and theory, Weisberg believes that literature should be valued for its ability to cause one to relate to others, and for the political and social contexts that novels, particularly those dealing with the law, grapple with. For Weisberg, this is reason enough for its justification in the legal arena because such novels cause their students to reach conclusions regarding human understanding. In his study ''Poethics'', Weisberg states that, "Poethics in its attention to legal communication and to the plight of those who are 'other', seeks to revitalize the ethical component of the law."

Richard Weisberg's interest in the law and literature movement might be seen as slightly different than that of White, who places emphasis on the rhetorical techniques and abilities that literature utilizes. Weisberg rather wishes to use literature as a way of critiquing social institutions and legal norms. For him it is the subject matter of novels and not their rhetorical tools that make them important in instructing law students, as well as furthering understanding of legal matters for the independent law scholar. 
	
One example of his attempting to validate his stance of the effect of novels onto legal minds, is one where Weisberg cites a real life French lawyer living in [[France]] during the beginning of the deportation of French [[Jews]] to [[concentration camps]]. The lawyer was attempting to assign the duty of determining Jewry of an individual with only two Jewish grandparents to the state, then controlled by the [[Nazis]] and collaborators. In describing the words chosen by the lawyer, Weisberg believes that the "masking of a moral crime" is a direct descendant of ''[[Nietzschean]] ressentiment'', which is widely believed to be a philosophical outlook that permeates through the writings of [[Albert Camus]] and Kafka-literary authors whose works law and literature proponents cite often, including Weisberg. His belief that ressentiment makes its way into the writings of lawyers, such as this Frenchman, is seen as enough of a reason for him to view legal novels as compelling arguments of the human condition and thus their validity towards legal debate.

== Law as literature ==
Law as literature scholars see value in the techniques employed by literary scholars. Generally speaking, these scholars may see legal text as a form of literature thus making [[literary critique]] and analysis of it possible. Unlike the law in literature scholars, these minds only see possibilities in the tools of literary theory, and not really the subject of the great novel that law students often find themselves reading, although most might agree that literature serves a purpose that allows for ethical development and growth within the student.

[[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] was a proponent of law as literature.  "The success of Cardozo's books was also due in part to their distinction as literature.  Convinced that style could not be separated from substance, Cardozo brought the Judicial process to life in lucid, eloquent prose sprinkled with humor, anecdotes, and practical allusions."  (enotes.com, Benjamin Nathan Cardozo 1870-1938)

While [[James Boyd White]] acknowledges the relevance of the ''law-in-literature'' perspective, he finds ''law-as-literature'' more tenable because of the position's ability to combine the two seemingly disparate disciplines and allow for text to fulfill its role of defining culture and creating relationships. According to White, [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''
{{quote|is meant to teach the reader how to read his way into becoming a member of an audience it defines-into becoming one who understands each shift of tone, who shares the perceptions and judgments the text invites him to make, and who feels the sentiments proper to the circumstances. Both for its characters and readers, this novel is in a sense about reading and what reading means}}

[[Ronald Dworkin]] also supports the arguments in favor of the use of literature to improve legal understanding.  In his article, ''Law as Interpretation'', Dworkin stated, "I propose that we can improve our understanding of law by comparing legal interpretation with interpretation in other fields of knowledge, particularly literature."  He believes that our interpretations of literary works may help us to an improved understanding of our [[cultural]] environment, which in turn helps us to come to a better understanding and interpretation of the law.

==Law and Literature in Europe==
The Law and Literature movement in Europe is wide-ranging and fruitful and a number of networks in [[Europe]] are significant to the movement.  There is for example a European Network for Law and Literature Scholarship run by Jeanne Gaakeer, Professor at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and Greta Olson, Professor at the Justus-Liebig Universität Giessen. Gaakeer's influence is also reflected in her publications, for example Hope Springs Eternal: An Introduction to the Work of James Boyd White (University of Michigan, 1998), and she is co-editor of Crossing Borders: law, language and Literature, Wolf Legal Publishers The Netherlands, 2008.  Greta Olsen has edited a number of books including 9/11 Ten Years On(2011) Current Trends in Narratology. Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 2011 and In the Grip of the Law: Trials, Prisons and the Space Between. Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 2004a.  There is also a Nordic Network for Law and Literature and two Italian Networks for Law and Literature, AIDEL and ISLL.  In Norway: The Bergen School of Law and Literature, directed by Professor Arild Linneberg, Faculty of Humanities, Department of Linguistic, Literary and Aesthetic Studies, University of Bergen. Law and Literature in Europe is energetic but at times less self-promoting than its American counterpart.  Greta Olson's article ‘De-Americanising Law and Literature Narratives: Opening Up the Story’ in the journal ‘Law and Literature’ 2010 (published by Cardozo in the USA) provides a reminder of scholarly activity in Europe as well as warning against a ‘tendency to universalise our scholarly narratives’ where some debates are particular to the American setting.  She calls upon European scholars to ‘remember that the peculiarities of our own legal systems and legal histories need to be kept in mind as we contest law with the aesthetic and use law to query the literary’.

Post-conference productions such as the [[Oxford University Press]] collection Law and Literature: Current Legal Issues Volume 2: Law and (1999) edited by [[Michael Freeman (editor)|Michael Freeman]] and [[Andrew Lewis (editor)|Andrew Lewis]] are testament to the number of approaches opened up by this interdisciplinary approach. In the United Kingdom, scholars of note include Maria Aristodemou, with her Law and Literature from her to eternity, which looks at a number of texts from ancient Greek to modern day novels from a feminist and postmodern perspective.  Adam Gearey's Law and Aesthetics provides a discussion of aesthetics and ethics relevant to contemporary law and literature scholarship, and to the development of postmodern jurisprudence, using a range of reference points from classical literature, from [[Sophocles]] to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] to [[Nietzsche]].  Professor Ian Ward, Law and Literature: Possibilities and Perspectives which considers a range of texts from [[Shakespeare]], to children's literature, to [[Ivan Klima]] and [[Umberto Eco]] and, more recently Ward's Law, Text, Terror,  looking at the phenomena of terror and the rhetoric of terrorism tracing back through literature, popular culture and politics.  Professor Melanie Williams’ book Empty Justice: One Hundred Years of Law, Literature and Philosophy explores in particular feminist and existential questions as well as genre movements relating to caselaw combined with works by, for example, [[Thomas Hardy]], [[J. G. Ballard]], [[John Fowles]], [[J. M. Coetzee]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Iris Murdoch]], whilst her Secrets and Laws provides a range of essays on legal and political issues of note, from ethics, terrorism and identity to notions of obscenity, rape, sex and violence, through the prism of poetry, [[W. H. Auden]] and [[R. S. Thomas]] as well as 19th and 20th century works of fiction.  Kieran Dolin's A Critical Introduction to Law and Literature takes in a wide range of historical periods from [[Renaissance literature]] to [[Victorian literature]] and modern texts, exploring a number of topical approaches to crime, feminism, race and colonialism, whilst [[Paul Raffield]]’s Shakespeare's Imaginary Constitution : late Elizabethan politics and the theatre of law (Hart, 2010) is an addition to the critical work available on Shakespeare and the Law. The Italian law and literature scholar Daniela Carpi has also written a book on Shakespeare and the Law as well as an interesting text discussing [[Plato]]’s relevance to 20th century English Literature.

These instances of European outputs in the Law and Literature movement are in no way representative of the large literature to be found in articles written by the above named scholars as well as others in the field.

==Significant contributions to the movement==
{{cleanup|date=September 2016|reason=Excessively biographical.}}

=== Jack Balkin ===
[[Jack Balkin]] is a professor of [[constitutional law]] at [[Yale Law School]]. While his work in legal rhetoric draws on literary theory, he contends that law is best analogized to the [[performing arts]] such as [[music]] and [[drama]], rather than to literature.  For this reason, there is little to no work in which Balkin analyzes literature's relevance to the law, but his applications of the argument through other artistic mediums gain him admission to this discussion, as well.

In his views on politics and its effect on legal standards, Balkin adheres to what is known as "[[partisan entrenchment]]".  This theory states that the party that controls the [[White House]] can place in the federal courts judges and justices that share the [[U.S. President|President]]'s political views.  This in turn affects [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] justices and, ultimately, constitutional doctrine.

[[Robert Barsky]] is a Professor of Literature, and a Professor of Law at [[Vanderbilt University]], where he actively teaches courses on the law-literature overlap, and directs the [https://my.vanderbilt.edu/robertbarsky/literature-and-law-seminar-robert-penn-warren-center/ Robert Penn Warren Seminar on Literature and Law]. His work focuses upon the construction in narrative of the person, either in law (with examples from the domain of Convention refugees and undocumented immigrants) or in literary texts, from a perspective that references the work of  [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin]],  [[Pierre Bourdieu]],  [[Marc Angenot]],  [[Michael Holquist]] and others. A longtime contributor to the field, and a frequent reviewer of texts relating to it, Barsky works to bring a humanistic approach that favors dialogism, storytelling and empathy to the many realms captured by the idea of border-crossing. His works include a trilogy of law-literature informed books ([https://www.routledge.com/Undocumented-Immigrants-in-an-Era-of-Arbitrary-Law-The-Flight-and-the/Barsky/p/book/9781138849488 Undocumented Immigrants in an Era of Arbitrary Law, Routledge Law 2016]; [https://www.routledge.com/Arguing-and-Justifying-Assessing-the-Convention-Refugees-Choice-of-Moment/Barsky/p/book/9780754614814 Arguing and Justifying, Ashgate 2001]; [https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/pbns.29/main Constructing a Productive Other, John Benjamins 1994]), and to the on-line open access border-crossing journal called AmeriQuests: Narrative, Law and Literature (www.ameriquests.org), which he founded as the Canadian Bicentennial Visiting Professor at the Yale Center for International and Area Studies in 2002-3. Because much of the legal corpus to which he refers emanates from the realm of migration studies, he has also contributed widely to translation and interpretations studies, with reference to both legal and literary texts.

=== Adam Gearey ===
Adam Gearey is Reader in Law at [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/law/ Birkbeck School of Law], [http://www.lon.ac.uk/ University of London].   He has a BA (Hons-English/History) ([[University of York]]), M.A. Socio-Legal Studies ([[University of Sheffield]]), CPE/LSF ([[Manchester Polytechnic]]), PhD (Birkbeck College, University of London).  He was appointed as a lecturer at [http://www.kent.ac.uk/law/ Kent Law School] in 1996, moving to the School of Law at Birkbeck in 1998.  In 2001-2002, he was a visiting professor in the Faculty of Law at [[Makerere University]], Uganda; and in 2003 a visiting professor at the [[University of Pretoria]]. He is currently a visiting scholar at The Center for Law and Society, [[University of California, Berkeley]] and a visiting professor at the [http://www.upeace.org/ University of Peace, Costa Rica]. His present project concerns political justice.

In [[The Times Higher Education]], Gearey [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=105603&amp;sectioncode=26 commented on his work on [[James Joyce]]'s chaotic novel, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''], and ideas of law, stating I tried to trace the ways the account of the giving of the law in the Bible fed into the narratives of Finnegans Wake. Just as the Bible appropriated the Jewish Old Test-ament account of the law, Joyce's novel, in its turn, rewrote the Gospel narratives, to become a messianic announcement of the female messiah and a new law of love. These ideas could not have been thought without the encouragement of the "[[critical legal theory]]" scene. ..But it would be wrong to see this as a "movement". It is an impossible community of those who disagree as much as they agree. Leaning to broadly continental traditions of thought, to [[psychoanalysis]], [[post-Marxism]] and [[feminism]], there is a strong sense of sustained and creative dialogue in "critical" circles. The revolution in legal thought is still to come’.

=== Eric Heinze ===
[[Eric Heinze]] is Professor of Law &amp; Humanities at the [//www.law.qmul.ac.uk/ School of Law, Queen Mary, University of London].   In ''The Concept of Injustice''&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; he presents a literary approach to reasoning about justice.  He calls that standpoint ‘post-classical’, in contrast to a ‘classical’ Western tradition, dating back to [[Plato Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']], which assumes a static, logical opposition between the concepts of ‘justice’ and ‘injustice’.  Heinze's ‘post-classical’ approach recognises the impossibility of theorising justice and injustice as mutually exclusive categories.

Central to Heinze's research is the thesis that law is constantly underpinned by necessary, yet conflicting and irreconcilable theories of its own legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;‘Power Politics and the Rule of Law: Shakespeare’s First Historical Tetralogy and Law’s “Foundations”’, '''29''' ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'' (2009), pp. 230-63; ‘Heir, Celebrity, Martyr, Monster: Legal and Political Legitimacy in Shakespeare and Beyond’, '''20'''(1) ''Law &amp; Critique'' (2009), pp. 79-103; ‘“This power isn’t power if it’s shared”: Law and Violence in Jean Racine’s ''La Thébaïde''’, '''22'''(1) Law &amp; Literature (2010), pp. 76 – 109&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his research focuses on the problem of legitimacy with particular reference to concepts of ‘imperialism’ and ‘nationalism’, concepts which he presents not as fixed, but as malleable and often overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;‘Imperialism and Nationalism in Early Modernity: The “Cosmopolitan” and The “Provincial” in Shakespeare’s Cymbeline’, '''18'''(3) ''Journal of Social &amp; Legal Studies'' (2009), pp. 139 – 68; ‘“He’d turn the world itself into a prison”: Empire and Enlightenment in Jean Racine’s ''Alexander the Great''’, '''4'''(1) ''Law &amp; Humanities'' (2010), pp. 63 – 89&lt;/ref&gt; His approach further examines language as both the defining yet also infinitely manipulated tool of law as the institution and justification of political power.&lt;ref&gt;‘“Where be his quiddities now?”: Law and Language ''in Hamlet''’, in ''Law and Language: Current Legal Issues'', vol. 15, Michael Freeman &amp; Fiona Smith, eds., Oxford University Press (2013), pp 201-20&lt;/ref&gt; Examining ancient and early modern literature, Heinze traces the demise of what he calls ‘unity’ theories of justice, and their progressive displacement by ‘measurement’ theories, which, he argues, become paramount within Western modernity.

=== Allan Hutchinson ===
[[Allan Hutchinson]] is a professor at [[York University]]'s [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] and served as associate dean from 1994 to 1996.  Hutchinson is a legal theorist and has devoted a lot of time to examining the failure of law.  He also believes there is no central or primary foundational interpretive method for interpreting the law.  The main point of his work is the judging of "an engaged game of rhetorical justification" which the judge must interpret, such as a [[statute]], a line of [[precedents]], or the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  He has a [[nonfoundationalist]] perspective which searches for the truth that forms [[reality]].  Hutchinson says that method and medium must change, so self-creation becomes the engine and energy of social change.  You can grasp life by living and this task cannot be completed by outside [[language]] or through language.  Hutchinson argues that politically charged and unstable context shapes our understanding of legal rules.  Hutchinson's understanding of truth confirms that law is [[politics]].  A nonfoundationalist account of law is compatible with a diverse range of political results. A definitive account of Hutchinson's legacy was published in ''[[The Journal Jurisprudence]]'', Vol 7, in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurisprudence.com.au/juris7/hm2.pdf|title=A Final Letter|author=Allan Hutchinson|publisher=''The Journal Jurisprudence'' Vol.7|date=2010|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ian Ward ===
Ian Ward is a professor of law and degree programme director at [[Newcastle University]] Law School. He is also on the editorial board for ''[[Studies in Law and Literature]].'' Ward received a BA from [[University of Keele]] in 1986, a Ph. D from [[University of Cambridge]] in 1989, an LLM from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1990 and a MSc from [[University of Leicester]] in 2010. Ward believes that students in both fields, law and literature, can benefit from studying rhetoric alongside law. His research lies in legal theory and [[public law]] among others. Ward has published numerous works dealing with law and literature and legal theory.

In his publication ''Law and Literature: Possibilities and Perspectives'', Ward discusses the future goals of the law and literature movement while exploring elements of law in famous pieces of literature. In chapter 1 of this publication, Ward describes law ''in'' literature as the process of examining "the possible relevance of literary text, particularly those which present themselves as telling a legal [[narrative|story]], as texts appropriate for study by legal scholars." He then sees law ''as'' literature as the process of seeking "to apply the techniques of literary criticism to legal texts." He believes that the relationship between the two are complimentary. He states discussing the debate about the importance of the Law and Literature Movement shows "its enduring strength."

=== Robin West ===
Another advocate for the integration of legal studies with the serious examination of literary texts, [[Robin West]] has frequently turned to [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Trial]]'' to discuss the [[rule of law]]. As a critic of [[Richard Posner]]'s more economic take on the law, she does not dismiss the implications made by authors in legal fictional texts. For example, when discussing Kafka, West asserts that:
{{quote|Obedience to legal rules to which we would have consented relieves us of the task of evaluating the [[morality]] and prudence of our actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin West]]. ''Authority Autonomy And Choice: The Role Of Consent In The Moral And Political Visions Of Franz Kafka And Richard Posner''. 99 Harv. L. Rev. 384, 424 (Dec. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Comments such as these show West's [[ideological]] stand on the power of literature as well as her personal [[philosophy of law]]. West's arguments tend to focus on the human condition as read in books as well as the individual submission to authority, and what she believes to be an apparent contradiction. She calls for scholars to interpret, create and critique narrative texts in order to broaden their understanding of the human condition, and the law's effect on it and the community as a whole. West believes in a so-called 'political, communal and ethical re-constitution', a mode of thinking that one might engage in when reading and critiquing texts, both fictional and legal.  Because of this duality, West asserts, law and literature become more related and thus more valid in discussion when debating the implications of one or the other.

These views have caused her to be seen as in the same camp as James Boyd White, although some argue that she goes even further, by becoming more of a political writer than a legal and literary critic. In her book, ''Narrative, Authority and the Law'', West notably diverges from thinkers like [[Richard Weisberg]] and James Boyd White by stating that there should be less focus on the debate within the texts and instead a 'truly radical critique of power'. She expands by stating, "By focusing on the distinctively imperative core of [[adjudication]], instead of its interpretive gloss, we free up meaningful criticism of law."

Such assertions lead some to believe her goals are more political than scholarly in nature.  West may be seen not only as a scholar of law and literature, but also as a member of the [[critical legal studies]] movement (CLS).

=== Melanie Williams ===
Melanie Williams read Law at the [[University of Cambridge]], graduating with a BA Hons in Law in 1988 (MA 1991).  She has a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] and an MA in [[English Literature]] from the [[University of Sussex]] and is a Fellow of the [[Higher Education Academy]].  She is Professor of Law at the School of Law, [[University of Exeter]].  Formerly, she was Professor and Reader of Law at [[Swansea University]] and prior to that Lecturer in Law at the [[University of Aberystwyth]] until 2003.  Professor Williams’ research interests include Interdisciplinary Studies in Philosophy, Law and Literature, Law and Culture; approaches to Law and Ethics, Feminist and Socio-legal studies.  She is an editorial board member with Law and Humanities (Hart); International Journal of Law in Context (CUP); Law, Culture and Humanities (Sage); Jurisprudence (Hart);‘Law and Literature’ series, DeGruyter, Berlin and New York.

A review of Professor Williams book [https://books.google.com/books/about/Empty_justice.html?id=L-BmBtjzwtgC&amp;redir_esc=y Empty Justice] in the Entertainment and Sports Law Journal [2006] reads:
‘Melanie Williams’s book is in part what its sub-title declares: a series of case studies dating from the end of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth, linking literary and philosophical texts to legal issues. It is also in part what its title declares: a peroration on the jurisprudential idea of ‘empty justice’, using literary texts as accessible ways into difficult concepts. What neither title nor sub-title declares is that this is first and foremost a work of feminist theory. Williams's goal has been to show (with doubters particularly in mind) ‘how pervasive feminist issues are for all persons and all belief systems’ (p. xxv).Williams wears her learning lightly, and the wealth of inter-woven illustrative examples, contextual details and outlines of theoretical debates really achieves its object of making feminist issues central, inevitable even. And she writes beautifully’.

Carmelo Delgado is an Academic founder of the Puerto Rican Academy o Jurisprudence and Legislation, the Academician of the Puerto Rican Academy of History and Academician of the Royal Spanish Academy.

== Criticisms of law and literature ==
[[Richard Posner]] has played an important role in the [[law and economics]] movement.  As the author of ''Law and Literature: A misunderstood Relationship'' (now in its third edition, titled simply ''Law and Literature''), Posner is highly critical of the law and literature movement and the book helps to voice his more hard-lined interpretation of the law. The book can be seen as a reaction against the writings of [[Robin West]], who has written substantially against Posner's economic take on [[Statutory interpretation|legal interpretation]]. A powerful critic of the writings of White, Weisberg, and West, Posner sees literature as having no weight in the legal realm although he does hold the authors in high esteem. He writes, "Although the writers we value have often put law into their writings, it does not follow that those writings are about law in any interesting way that a lawyer might be able to elucidate."

Posner does not believe in the use of literary discourse in jurisprudential debate, and in [[Colloquy (law)|colloquy]] has described West's analysis of literature in legal debate as "particularly eccentric."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Posner|Richard A Posner]]. ''The Ethical Significance of Free Choice: A Reply to Professor West''. 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1433 (1985-1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Posner writes that "law is subject matter rather than technique", and that legal method is the method of choice in legal realms, not a literary one. To expand further, Posner believes literary works have no place in judicial debate because one can never truly contemplate the original meaning of the author, and that novels should only be considered in their contexts. He characterizes the discovery of laws in fiction as "ancillary" and asserts the main subject matter of a novel is always the human condition, and not the legal setting. From this perspective, the legal background created by [[Kafka]] and [[Albert Camus]] are simply that, background, and have no further meaning beyond the environment which they create.

This isn't to say that Posner doesn't think in literary terms-far from it. For instance he characterizes [[Albert Camus]]'s ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', as the "growth of self-awareness" on the part of the hero, [[Meursault]]. Posner gives weight to such situations on personal levels and only on personal levels, yet dismisses any sort of legal implications of such situations as lacking in "[[wikt:realism|realism]]". Such assertions and arguments have placed him in sharp contrast with Richard Weisberg, who has cited ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' numerous times, among other books. Posner sees literature's importance in legal studies only because they may help the lawyer grow as an individual and to develop character, but sees no value in them as social critiques of the era in which they were developed and written, as Law and Literature scholars might ascribe to them. Certainly he sees no value in them as sources of [[legal philosophy]] and reform.

Highly critical of the notable Law and Literature scholars, Posner believes that such legal minds have taken literature "too seriously" and assigned them an unsubstantiated amount of weight in the expansion of legal knowledge and jurisprudential debate.

[[Richard Delgado]] and [[Jean Stefancic]] were against White and his theory of certain famous legal cases in U.S. history and agree with Posner on several issues.  Their theory is that the actual impact of [[contemporary literature]] on the substance of judicial opinion-making is limited because judges distinguish legal texts.  According to Delgado and Stefancic, judges' moral positions are determined by normative social and political forces rather than by literature.  They are firm believers of the [[critical race theory]] which is a school of sociological thought that emphasizes the socially constructed nature of race.

The '''Legal Tools''' are the leading online [[database]] on [[international criminal law]]. The database provides legal practitioners and researchers with [[open access]] information on the core crimes of international law ([[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]] and the [[crime of aggression]]). Being a tool of [[computer-assisted legal research]], the database provides access to all relevant [[case law]] and legislation ([[statute]]s, preparatory works, key [[treaty|treaties]]) from both international and national jurisdictions as well as academic writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-tools.org/what-are-the-icc-legal-tools/ What are the ICC Legal Tools?]&lt;/ref&gt; All resources are stored under [[persistent uniform resource locator|persistent URLs]].

The ''Legal Tools Project'' (''LTP'') is associated with the [[International Criminal Court]]. It currently has partners from fourteen countries on all continents. The content of the database is mainly provided by academic institutions and [[non-governmental organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-tools.org/what-are-the-icc-legal-tools/ What are the ICC Legal Tools?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Criminal Court links in its publicised decisions to the database. As an example, the judgement of the trial chamber in the case of [[Germain Katanga]] included 538 [[hyperlink]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-tools.org/doc/f74b4f/ ICC, Judgement of 7. March 2014 (Katanga, TC)], PDF-File, 6,7MB).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
As of April 2016, the database contains over 103.000 documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-tools.org/status-of-work-on-the-tools/ Status of work on the Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; The content is arranged in the following collections:

* ICC Documents
* ICC Preparatory Works and [[Amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute Amendments]]
* International Legal Instruments
* Other International Law Decisions and Documents
* [[Human Rights Law]] Decisions and Documents
* International(ised) Criminal Jurisdictions (Basic Documents)

'''Legal advertising''' is [[advertising]] by [[lawyer]]s ([[attorneys at law]]) and [[law firm]]s. Legal [[marketing]] is a broader term referring to advertising and other practices, such as client relations, [[cross-selling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marketing Monday: are law firms getting smarter using CRM? + infographic|url=http://www.legaltechnology.com/latest-news/marketing-monday-are-law-firms-getting-smarter-using-crm-infographic/|publisher=www.legaltechnology.com|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[public relations]] and maintaining contact with [[Alumnus|alumni]].

==England and Wales==
Legal marketing has been permitted in [[England and Wales]] since 1986, when the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] first permitted lawyers to advertise. The Financial Services Authority now licences helplines and claims management agencies - except trade unions - which typically advertise and refer claims to lawyers.

==European Union==
From the 1990s, other [[jurisdiction]]s in [[continental Europe]] progressively opened way for advertising. [[Advocate]]s in [[Spain]], [[France]]. and [[Germany]] are among those able to freely use instruments of communication.

==India==
In [[India]], an advocate shall not solicit work or advertise, except through a medium maintained by the Bar Council of India, either directly or indirectly, whether by circulars, advertisements, touts, personal communications, interviews not warranted by personal relations, furnishing or inspiring newspaper comments or producing his/her photographs to be published in connection with cases in which they have been engaged or concerned. Their sign-board or name-plate should be of a reasonable size. The sign-board or name-plate or stationery should not indicate that they are or have been a President or Member of a Bar Council or of any Association or that they have been associated with any person or organization or with any particular cause or matter or that they specialize in any particular type of work or that they had been a Judge or an Advocate General.S oliciting work or advertise” as used in this clause of the Code would not mean and include setting up of a web-site by an advocate or a law firm giving only basic information about the names and number of lawyers in a law firm, the contact details and areas of practice. This would apply similarly to lawyers’ brochures and law directories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules on Professional Standards &lt; Bar Council of India|url=http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/about/professional-standards/rules-on-professional-standards/|website=Bar Council of India|publisher=Bar Council of India|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the amended rule, advocates can mention in their chosen websites, their names, telephone numbers, e-mail ID, professional qualification and areas of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 Reasons why Lawyers in India should be allowed to Advertise |url=https://mehnat.in/reasons_lawyers_should_be_allowed_to_advertise.html/||accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
In [[Israel]], legal marketing managers in big law firms were active since 2006. Their activity expanded due to the [[Late-2000s recession]] which affected law firms, and due to the large number of lawyers per capita in Israel.

==Italy==
In [[Italy]], the Bersani Decree of July 2, converted into law in January 2007 gives lawyers the right to advertise.

==United States==
{{main|Legal advertising in the United States}}

Lawyer advertising in the United States is legal, although subject to ethical rules promulgated by state bar associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lawyer Advertising at the Crossroads|date=1995|publisher=American Bar Association|isbn=157073142X|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/resources/professionalism/crossroads.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cases on Lawyer Advertising|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/resources/professionalism/professionalism_ethics_in_lawyer_advertising/clearinghouse.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly encountered forms of lawyer advertising include television and radio commercials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Joseph F.|title=Jersey Lets its Lawyers Run TV and Radio Ads|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/20/nyregion/jersey-lets-its-lawyers-run-tv-and-radio-ads.html|accessdate=5 December 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=20 January 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; print advertisements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Roy|title=Thumbnail Guide to Amended Advertising Rules|url=http://www.newyorklegalethics.com/thumbnail-guide-to-amended-advertising-rules/|website=New York Legal Ethics Reporter|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; billboards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billboard Advertisement|url=https://www.jud.ct.gov/sgc/Adv_opinions/Adv_10-01283-A.pdf|website=Statewide Grievance Committee|publisher=Connecticut Judicial Branch|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; direct mail marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spahn|first1=Thomas E.|title=Lawyer Marketing: An Ethics Guide|url=http://media.mcguirewoods.com/publications/Ethics-Programs/9723312.pdf|website=McGuireWoods LLP|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; law firm websites, and participation in telephone directories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Should Lawyers Still Advertise in the Yellow Pages|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/practice_management/website_roi.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; commercial directories and referral services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Bar Differentiates Online Directories From Lawyer Referral Services|url=https://www.hinshawlaw.com/newsroom-publications-alerts-304.html|website=Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson LLP|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through online advertising and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Filisko|first1=G.M.|title=The Ethics of Online Advertising|url=https://abaforlawstudents.com/2013/03/03/ethics-online-advertising/|website=ABA for Law Students|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the [[American Bar Association]] ("ABA") established its first ethics code, known as the Canons of Professional Ethics, which condemned all advertisement and solicitation by lawyers. Due to the progression of the legal profession and the desire to update the Canons of Professional Ethics, the ABA created the Model Code of Professional Responsibility ("Model Code") in 1969. The Model Code was an effort by the ABA to create practical rules that went "beyond the pretty details of form and manners" and addressed "the chained relationship of the lawyer to his clients, to his professional brethren and to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Emily, "Ethics of Attorney Advertising: The Effects of Different State Regulatory Regimes, The" Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics, The (2005) http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geojlege18&amp;div=57&amp;id=&amp;page=&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major [[case law]] decision on legal advertising is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Bates v. Arizona State Bar]]'' 433 U.S. 350 (1977), in which the [[United States Supreme Court]], held that lawyer advertising is partially protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 363-64 (1977).https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0433_0350_ZS.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court rejected the argument by the Arizona Bar that attorney advertising was "inherently misleading" and "tarnish the dignified public image of the profession." The Court found "the postulated connection between advertising and the erosion of true professionalism to be severely strained," and noted that "lack of legal advertising could be viewed as the profession's failure to 'reach out and serve the community.'"&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, Amy, "Navigating a sea of uncertainty: How existing ethical guidelines pertain to the marketing of legal services over the Internet" The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics (July 2001) http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/geojlege14&amp;div=49&amp;id=&amp;page=&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) responded to the Supreme Court of Alabama's June 26, 2002 invitation to comment on the Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct entitled ''Information about Legal Services''. In this response, the FTC "encourages competition in the licensed professions, including the legal profession, to the maximum extent compatible with other state and federal goals."&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission, "Response to Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct" (September 2002) http://www.ftc.gov/be/v020023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, on May 26, 2006, the FTC commented on the State Bar of Texas Professional Ethics Committee's consideration on whether or not it is ethical for a Texas attorney to participate in an online lawyer referral services. The FTC determined that "online legal matching services are a valuable option for Texans: they are likely to reduce the consumers' cost for finding legal representation and have the potential to increase completion among attorneys."&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission, "Comments on a Request for Ethics Opinion Regarding Online Attorney Matching Programs" (May 2006) {{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/2006/05/V060017CommentsonaRequestforAnEthicsOpinionImage |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924024155/http://www.ftc.gov/os/2006/05/V060017CommentsonaRequestforAnEthicsOpinionImage |archivedate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain marketing practices are considered illegal, and many others may be considered violations of [[legal ethics]]. [[Shock advertising]], for example, would be considered unethical; directly soliciting clients (known as [[Barratry (common law)|barratry]], or "[[ambulance chasing]]") is illegal.

The [[New York State Unified Court System|New York]] and [[Florida]] [[court system]]s proposed several restrictions on advertising in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Law.com article from June 15, 2006 New York Law Journal (N.Y.L.J.) article on NY proposals by John Caher:[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1150275921219]&lt;/ref&gt; The N.Y. proposals generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donovan|first1=Karen|title=New York Law Firms Struggle With New Restrictions on Advertising|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/02/business/media/02law.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, [[New York State Bar Association]] President Vincent Buzard appointed a Task Force on Lawyer Advertising, chaired by Bernice K. Leber, to make proposals for consideration by NYSBA and the New York courts.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rush, ''U.S. District Court: Some advertising rules unconstitutional,'' ''State Bar News'', September/October 2007, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rules for New York were effective on February 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;For the full rules, see: [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/attorney_ads_amendments.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first time, the New York [[Legal system]] defined legal advertising, as:&lt;br&gt;
"any public or private communication made on or behalf of a lawyer or law firm about that lawyer or law firm's services, the primary purpose of which is for the retention of the lawyer or law firm."&lt;ref&gt;11 New York Code of Rules and Regulations (N.Y.C.R.R.) part 1200, section 1200.1 (k), found at [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/1200-1_final.pdf] (requires Acrobat-TM reader).&lt;/ref&gt;  The new rule specifically exempts communications to existing clients or other lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Publicity]] is, for the first time, also included as a [[synonym]] of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;11 N.Y.C.R.R. part 1200, section 1200.6, also known as the Code of Professional Responsibility, Disciplinary Rule (DR) 2-101, found at: [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/1200-6_final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The newly revised rules now allow advertising about a lawyer's publications and "[[bona fide]] professional ratings".&lt;ref&gt;Id., at DR 2-101 (b) (1).&lt;/ref&gt;  There are certain special rules for email advertising, prohibiting [[E-mail spam|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;Id., DR 2-101 (b).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 rules stated that advertising must not include a number of prohibited [[marketing]] devices:
# Certain [[Testimonial|endorsements or testimonials]] from a former client
# Portrayal of [[judge]]s
# Paid, undisclosed payment of testimonials
# Portrayal of a judge, or [[Fiction|fictitious]] lawyer or law firm
# Use of actors or fictionalized persons
# Irrelevant characteristics of the lawyers
# Ads that resemble [[Legal instrument|legal documents]]
# Certain limits on soliciting new clients for 30 days after a [[tort]]
# Certain other limits on communications with non-clients

{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
A '''legal case''' is a dispute between opposing parties resolved by a [[court]], or by some equivalent legal process. A legal case may be either [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law]]. In each legal case there is an [[Plaintiff|accuser]] and one or more [[defendant]]s.

==Civil case==
A civil case, more commonly known as a [[lawsuit]] or [[Controversy (law)|controversy]], begins when a [[plaintiff]] [[file (legal)|files]] a document called a [[complaint]] with a court, informing the court of the wrong that the plaintiff has allegedly suffered because of the [[defendant]], and requesting a [[judicial remedy|remedy]]. The remedy sought may be money, an [[injunction]], which requires the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some action, or a [[declaratory judgment]], which determines that the plaintiff has certain legal rights. The remedy will be prescribed by the court if the plaintiff wins the case. A civil case can also be arbitrated through [[arbitration]], which may result in a faster settlement, with lower costs, than could be obtained by going through a trial. 

The plaintiff must make a genuine effort to inform the defendant of the case through [[service of process]], by which the plaintiff delivers to the defendant the same documents that the plaintiff filed with the court.

At any point during the case, the parties can agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], which will end the case, although in some circumstances, such as in [[class action]]s, a settlement requires court approval in order to be binding.

===Family case===
Cases involving separation including asset division, support (a.k.a. maintenance or alimony), and matters related to children are handled differently in different jurisdictions. Often, the court's procedure for dealing with family cases is very similar to that of a civil case (it requires service and disclosure, and will issue judgments).

Divorce and separation from a spouse is one of the most stressful situations, as rated by the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale#Adults|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], and so family proceedings are increasingly being "divorced" from the often very formal and impersonal process of civil proceedings, and given special treatment.

==Criminal case==
{{Main article|Criminal case}}
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian criminal cases]]
A [[criminal case]], in [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions, begins when a person suspected of a crime is [[indictment|indicted]] by a grand jury or otherwise charged with the offense by a government official called a [[prosecutor]] or [[district attorney]].

A criminal case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a [[Trial (law)|trial]] through a [[plea bargain]]. Typically, in a plea bargain, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a plea bargain.

==Common elements==
Legal cases, whether criminal or civil, are premised on the idea that a dispute will be fairly resolved when a [[legal procedure]] exists by which the dispute can be brought to a factfinder not otherwise involved in the case, who can evaluate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine the truth with respect to claims of guilt, innocence, liability, or lack of fault. Details of the procedure may depend on both the kind of case and the kind of system in which the case is brought - whether, for example, it is an [[inquisitorial system]] or a solo

===Designation and citation===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Tochigi patricide case]]--&gt;
{{main|Case citation}}
In most systems, the governing body responsible for overseeing the courts assigns a unique number/letter combination or similar designation to each case in order to track the various disputes that are or have been before it. The outcome of the case is recorded, and can later be reviewed by obtaining a copy of the documents associated with the designation previously assigned to the case.

However, it is often more convenient to refer to cases{{spaced ndash}}particularly landmark and other notable cases{{spaced ndash}}by a title of the form ''Claimant [[wikt:v.|v]] Defendant'' (e.g. ''[[Arkell v Pressdram]]'').  Where a legal proceeding does not have formally designated adverse parties, a form such as ''[[In re]]'', ''Re'' or ''In the matter of'' is used (e.g. ''[[In re Gault]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/publications/oscola.php |publisher=Hart Publishers |edition=4 |year=2012 |isbn=9781849463676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "v" separating the parties is an abbreviation of the Latin [[wikt:versus|versus]], but, when spoken in [[Commonwealth countries]], it is normally rendered as "[[wikt:and|and]]" or "[[wikt:against|against]]" (as in, for example, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'').  Where it is considered necessary to protect the anonymity of a [[natural person]], some cases may have one or both parties replaced by a standard pseudonym ([[John Doe|Jane Roe]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'') or by an initial (''[[D v D]]'').  In titles such as ''[[R v Adams]]'', however, the initial "R" is usually an abbreviation for the Latin [[King|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]], i.e. for [[the Crown]]. (For an explanation of other terms that may appear in case titles, see the [[Glossary of legal terms]].)

{{Libertarianism in the United States sidebar|Related}}
'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J. Richard Piper, ''Ideologies and Institutions: American Conservative and Liberal Governance Prescriptions Since 1933'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u93Mj3A-tH8C&amp;pg=PA110 pp. 110–111], {{ISBN|0847684598}}, {{ISBN|978-0847684595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting [[civil society]] through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/getting-libertarianism-right Getting Libertarianism Right]. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. {{ISBN|978-1-61016-690-4}}. [[Mises Institute]] Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|title=The Rise of the City: 1878-1898|publisher=The Academy of Political Science|date=September 1933|orig-year=1st pub. 1933|pages=454–456|chapter=Vol. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Randall|title=Sandino's Daughters: Testimonies of Nicaraguan Women in Struggle|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 14, 2018|orig-year=1st pub. 1995|pages=ii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Carey (Editor), ''Freedom &amp; Virtue: The Conservative Libertarian Debate,'' Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882926-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker. Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/mafaldo1.html|title=The Conservative Case for Ron Paul|last=Mafaldo|first=Lucas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] have been described as combining libertarian and conservative "[[small government]]" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

A '''plenary power''' or '''plenary authority''' is a complete and absolute power to take action on a particular issue,   with no limitations. It is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''plenus'' ("full").

==United States==
In [[United States constitutional law]], plenary power is a power that has been granted to a body  or person in absolute terms, with no review of or limitations upon the exercise of that power. The assignment of a plenary power to one body divests all other bodies from the right to exercise that power, where not otherwise entitled. Plenary powers are not subject to [[judicial review]] in a particular instance or in general.

There are very few clear examples of such powers in the United States, due to the nature of the Constitution, which grants different, but at times overlapping, roles to the three branches of federal government and to the states. For example, although the [[United States Congress]], under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (the [[Commerce Clause]]), has been said to have "plenary" power over Interstate Commerce, this does not always preclude the states from passing laws that affect interstate commerce in some way. When an activity is legally classified as interstate commerce, historically the states can regulate this type of activity as long as they do so within the bounds of their Constitutional authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/38/commerce-among-the-states ''The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Commerce among the States'']. [[The Heritage Foundation]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress does appear to have complete and absolute power regarding the declaration of war and peace in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11. Yet the President has control over the Armed Forces as Commander-in-Chief. These powers are in ongoing conflict, as seen by the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

Another example of the ongoing debate over plenary powers in the US Constitution is the controversy surrounding the [[Spending Clause]] (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). This clause states that the Congress is allowed to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence [sic] and general Welfare of the United States". How far this clause goes, and what it actually means in practice, has been hotly debated since the ratification of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/34/spending-clause ''The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Spending Clause'']. [[The Heritage Foundation]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

While other Constitutional doctrines, such as the unenumerated powers of states and the rights of individuals, are widely held (both historically and currently) as limiting the plenary power of Congress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/10/essays/163/reserved-powers-of-the-states ''The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Reserved Powers of the States'']. [[The Heritage Foundation]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; then-[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] reflected that "one of the greatest 'fictions' of our federal system is that the Congress exercises only those powers delegated to it, while the remainder are reserved to the States or to the people. The manner in which this Court has construed the Commerce Clause amply illustrates the extent of this fiction. Although it is clear that the people, through the States, delegated authority to Congress to 'regulate Commerce ... among the several States' ([[Commerce Clause]]), one could easily get the sense from this Court's opinions that the federal system exists only at the sufferance of Congress." (''[[Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Association]]'', 1981.)

These conflicts over the definition of who or what retains which plenary powers have wide-ranging consequences, as seen in the example of ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'', where the Supreme Court found that Congress had complete authority over all Native American affairs.

===Statutes===
The Congress may create and charter, through the enactment of statutes, corporate bodies (Federal Corporations) which can be granted (through the Congress' plenary power to legislate) derivative (derived from the legislation, as opposed to the Constitution itself) plenary power(s) in areas that are defined by statute and which comport with the constitution.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) is an example of such an entity. It was created by the Congress as a Federal Corporation, and by statute, the TVA is given plenary authority over the setting the rates (prices) it will charge customers for the electricity that it generates. The Congress effectively gave the TVA plenary power over its generated electricity rate (price) setting process by statutorily making TVA's rate (price) settings exempt and immune from legal review by any process whatsoever, be it State, Federal or otherwise. Once the TVA Act itself was ruled constitutional, its rate setting process received its derivative plenary power.

There is a difference in reach of plenary powers. While in the TVA example the Congress may at any time amend or remove TVA's plenary power to set the rates for the electricity it sells, the President's plenary power to pardon or commute those convicted under the laws of the United States is beyond the reach of the processes of the Federal Government, and requires the amendment of the US Constitution, making it a truly plenary grant of power.

===Presidential pardons===
An example of a plenary power granted to an individual is the power to grant pardons for Federal crimes (not State crimes), which is bestowed upon the [[President of the United States]] under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]], Section 2, of the US Constitution. The President is granted the power to "grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment".

That is, within the defined zone (e.g., all offences against the United States, except impeachment), the President may modify the punishment, up to the eradication of the fact of conviction and punishment, for offenses against the United States, entirely. Once done, the President's exercise of this power may not be reviewed by any body or through any forum; nor can this self-executing power (because it is self-executing), once exercised by a President, be reversed, or "taken back", by either the granting President, or any of his/her successors.

Neither the power to grant pardon nor the power to construct the scope of a pardon (a commutation) is within the reach of any subsequent review or alteration. Furthermore, [[double jeopardy]] prohibits any subsequent prosecution for the offenses over which the pardon was granted. Even the President himself may not rescind a pardon that either he or a predecessor President has granted once such pardon is executed (i.e., once the official instrument is signed by the President and sealed on behalf of the United States).

The President may also (as in the case of President [[Gerald Ford]] and the then former President [[Richard Nixon]], as well as President [[George H. W. Bush]] and the former Secretary of Defense [[Caspar W. Weinberger]]) ''prospectively'' proclaim a grant of pardon. That is the President may proclaim the pardon of an individual, a group, a corporation, or any entity chargeable of offences under Federal law, prospectively making the subject immune from Federal prosecution for past criminal acts.

Such a pardon does this by destroying the possibility of a prosecution having a purposeful meaning or result. The rules of [[judicial procedure]] make such a future prosecution, or the continuance of an ongoing prosecution, moot. Thereby a motion for dismissal of an ongoing prosecution, or of an initiated future prosecution, is granted by a Court, on the grounds that the prosecution would be of no purpose or effect, and that it would needlessly waste a Court's time and the resources of an accused, who would only have the charges, for which a pardon had been proclaimed, dismissed anyway.

===Immigration law===
{{See also|Consular nonreviewability}}
In regard to immigration law, Congress, under the Plenary Power Doctrine, has the power to make immigration policy subject to judicial oversight. The Executive Branch is charged with enforcing the immigration laws passed by Congress. The doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders. Courts generally refrain from interfering in immigration matters.&lt;ref name="cis.org"/&gt; Historically, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken a hands-off approach when asked to review the political branches' immigration decisions and policy-making. The [[Center for Immigration Studies]], an organization with a slant toward isolationism, suggests there is a movement to "erode" political-branch control over immigration in favor of a judge-administered system and that the results have created national security concerns.&lt;ref name="cis.org"&gt;Jon Feere, [http://www.cis.org/plenarypower ''Plenary Power: Should Judges Control U.S. Immigration Policy?''] [[Center for Immigration Studies]], February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Zadvydas v. Davis]]'' is cited as an example of the U.S. Supreme Court not following plenary power precedent.&lt;ref name="cis.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel J. Chin]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1789185 ''Is There a Plenary Power Doctrine? A Tentative Apology and Prediction for Our Strange but Unexceptional Constitutional Immigration Law''].  Georgetown Immigration Law Review, Vol. 14, No. 2, p. 257, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pocket Veto Case''' (also known as '''''Bands of the State of Washington v. United States''''' and '''''Okanogan, Methow, San Poelis, Nespelem, Colville, and Lake Indian Tribes v. United States'''''), 279 U.S. 655 (1929), was a 1929 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision which interpreted the Constitutional provisions regarding the [[pocket veto]]. 

==Background==
According to [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[US Constitution]], a bill that the President has not signed and not vetoed becomes law ten days after being sent to the President (not including Sundays) "unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law."

The action of the President allowing a bill to expire without signing it after the adjournment of Congress is known as a [[pocket veto]]. The pocket veto had been used by Presidents starting with [[James Madison]]. 

In 1926, the [[United States Congress]] passed Senate Bill 3185, allowing [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]] to sue for damages from the loss of their tribal lands. On June 24, 1926, the bill was sent to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] for him to sign or veto. Congress adjourned for the summer on July 3. After July 6, the tenth day after the bill's passage, the law passed without a presidential signature or veto. 

Several Indian tribes (the [[Okanagan people|Okanogan]], [[Methow (tribe)|Methow]], [[Sanpoil (tribe)|Sanpoil]], [[Nespelem (tribe)|Nespelem]], [[Colville (tribe)|Colville]], and the [[Sinixt|Lake Indian Tribes]]) filed suit in the [[United States Court of Claims]], which ruled that their case had no legal merit. The Indian tribes appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. Arguing on behalf of the United States, [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[William D. Mitchell]] argued that the pocket veto was a long-established practice that had been used to decide many important cases. The case was argued on March 11, 1929 and was decided on May 27, 1929.

The case hinged on the definition of "adjournment," in Article I.

==Decision==
In a 9–0 decision, the court affirmed the lower court's ruling. The decision, written by Justice [[Edward Terry Sanford]], noted that adjournment should be interpreted broadly, to mean any cessation of congressional legislative activity. 

The court revisited the issue of pocket vetos in {{ussc|name=Wright v. United States|302|583|1938}}.

'''Political journalism''' is a broad branch of [[journalism]] that includes coverage of all aspects of [[politics]] and [[political science]], although the term usually refers specifically to coverage of civil [[government]]s and [[political power]].

Political journalism aims to provide voters with the information to formulate their own opinion and participate in community, local or national matters that will affect them. According to Edward Morrissey in an opinion article from theweek.com, political journalism frequently includes opinion journalism, as current political events can be biased in their reporting. The information provided includes facts, its perspective is subjective and leans towards one viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrissey|first1=Edward|title=The election is not rigged against Trump. But the media is biased against the GOP.|url=http://theweek.com/articles/655596/election-not-rigged-against-trump-but-media-biased-against-gop|website=the week.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brendan Nyhan and John Sides argue that "Political journalists who report on politics are frequently unfamiliar with political science research or question its relevance to their work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists covering politics who are unfamiliar with information that would provide context to their stories can enable the story to take a different spin on what is being reported.

Political journalism is provided through different mediums, in print, broadcast, or online reporting. Digital media use has increased and it provides instant coverage of campaign, politics, event news and an accessible platform for the candidate. Media outlets known for their political journalism like ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', have increased their use of this medium as well. Printed, online, and broadcast political humor presented as entertainment has been used to provide updates on aspects of government status, political news, campaign, and election updates. According to Geoffrey Baym, the information provided may not be considered "fake news" but the lines between entertainment and factual news may seem blurred or biased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Journalism Journal|date=2005|pages=259–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; while providing political updates. This type of journalism is analyzed, interpreted, and discussed by news media pundits and editorialists. It can lack objectivity which can prevent the accuracy of the presented information. The reporting of news with a bias view point can also take away the audience's ability to form their own opinion or beliefs of what has been reported. This type of reporting is subjective with a possible social or political purpose.

==Subsets==
* '''Election journalism''' or '''electoral journalism''' is a subgenre of political journalism which focuses upon and analyzes developments related to an approximate election and political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|title=Towards an electoral journalism|first=Jorge|last=Bravo|journal=Mundo Electoral - Electoral World|publisher=mundoelectoral.com|volume=3|issue=8|date=May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402102625/http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|archivedate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of journalism provides information to the electorate that can educate and help form opinion that empowers a specific vote. This subgenre, like data journalism, makes use of numerical data, such as statistics, polls and historic data in regards to a candidate's chance of success for office, or a party's change in size in a legislature. It provides knowledge that may make the presented news hold more relevance. Information added to the reports are of campaign statuses and political events. A politician's strategy can be exaggerated or provided without context or historical perspective. Trends on each party candidate are reported and at times compared to previous party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help Journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news on the status of the elections, like other political reporting's, are provided in different mediums. The election report coverage has taken full advantage of the digital era in providing instant access to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piechota|first1=Grazyna|title=Media in Election Process|journal=Communication Today|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Defense journalism''' or '''military journalism''' is a subgenre which focuses upon the current status of a nation's military, intelligence and other defense-related faculties. Interest in defense journalism tends to increase during times of violent conflict, with military leaders being the primary actors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} During the course of military journalism, news reporters are sometimes assigned to military units to report news taking place in areas of conflict. The term embedded journalism was used when the media was involved in the reporting of the war in Iraq. Embedded journalism can also be biased because it is one sided. Information reported has been collected from the area the journalist has been stationed with the possibility to lean towards the agenda of the group they have been assigned to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahey|first1=Shahira|last2=Johnson|first2=Thomas J.|title="HOW WE PERFORMED": EMBEDDED JOURNALISTS ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS COVERING THE IRAQ WAR"|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2005|pages=301–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subgenre of political journalism is also applied to media coming from journalists embedded in a particular campaign or candidate. Like military assignments, reports can be influenced by the message the campaign or candidate is trying to bring across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|title=The dangers of embedded journalism, in war and politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001100_2.html?sid=ST2010043001134|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''postglossators''' or '''commentators''' formed a European legal school which arose in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] and [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] in the fourteenth century. They form the highest point of development of [[medieval Roman law]].

The school of the ''[[glossator]]s'' in [[Bologna]] lost its vitality, resulting in the rise of a new school of legal thought in the 14th century, centred on [[Orléans]] in France. [[Bartolus]] was the most famous of the commentators. Rather than simply seeking to explain the law, the commentators were more concerned with the potential for practical application of the law. Politically at this time, the idea of the [[Spirit of One]] – one church and one empire, was popular in Europe. [[Roman law]] thus appealed as bringing the potential for one law in addition. Roman law was written and certain as well as being generally consistent and complete. The educated liked its roots and saw the potential for application.

The commentators faced head on the conflict of law with custom as they saw the potential for practical application of the Roman law. They were opportunistic and as [[Italy in the Middle Ages|medieval Italy]] flourished, there were many opportunities to be the mediator between the developing political, scientific and economic spheres. Thus many of their ideas were based on practical morality, bold construction of the law and clever interpretations. For example, feudal law, which violated the absoluteness of dominium, was harmonised with Roman law by drawing links with the long lease, which gave rise to a vindicatio directa. The commentators argued that the vindicata directa was evidence of another type of ownership and that feudal ownership could fall within this category. This made Roman law more flexible, although was clearly a move away from the texts, and thus made it of greater practical use to rulers who were seeking a rational and coherent law.

The Commentators went beyond the [[glossators]], who had treated each text separately. The commentators instead wrote prose commentaries on the texts (rather like lectures,) working through, book by book, through the Digest. Rather than simply taking individual Roman law texts at face value, making it useful for practical application involved considering the rationale and principles behind the law. Certain areas were thus not considered at all, for example, Bartolus makes no attempt to consider culpa. However, this general approach produced a far more sophisticated law and enabled harmonisation between Roman law and local law. For example, Roman law said that a will was valid if you had 5 witnesses and that Roman law superseded customary law, whilst Venice law only required 3 witnesses. Bartolus’ approach was to consider why Roman law superseded custom. He concluded that this was because custom was presumed bad. However, in certain circumstances, custom would be allowed by the Emperor, where the law was considered good. Since the [[Venice]] law had come into practice after the Emperor, the Emperor had not considered if it were good law. However, it clearly was and therefore it should be allowed to continue. The Commentators also harmonised canon law with Roman law to some extent. Canonists argued that bare agreement could give rise to an action (but they only had jurisdiction where that agreement was made by oath.) The Commentators said that the canon law was simply a form of clothing which could make a bare pact enforceable.

The extraction of general principles allowed Roman law to be used in situations which were unfamiliar to the Romans, it provided a coherent and convenient set of rules, which could then be used to interpret local customs, which were given primacy but very narrowly interpreted. The impact of the commentators was thus substantial. Their commentaries were found throughout Europe, in fact it was said that if one was not a Bartolist (a commentator), one could not be a lawyer at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">'''Proximity of blood''', or '''proximity by degree''' of [[degree of kinship|kinship]], is one of the ways to determine [[Hereditary title|hereditary]] [[Order of succession|succession]] based on [[genealogy]]. In effect, the application of this rule is a refusal to recognize the [[per stirpes|right of representation]], a component of [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}}

In some feudal entities, proximity of blood was a generally accepted principle. For example, it is called the "ancient custom" ({{lang-fr|ancienne coutume}}) in the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], where a grandson could not take precedence over a son, and it was not even clear whether the ruler's grandson could claim precedence over the ruler's brother.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

== Examples ==
Proximity of blood and primogeniture were at loggerheads in numerous medieval succession disputes.

===Successful applications===
*When [[Richard the Lionheart]] died in 1199, the succession to the English throne, as well as to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], was disputed between his fourth but sole surviving brother, [[John, King of England|John]], and his nephew [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]] (the son of his second brother, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]]). The Angevin law favored primogeniture and thus Arthur, while the Norman law recognized the proximity of blood and gave precedence to John. Arthur's claim had been recognized by Richard in 1191, but just before his death Richard expressed support for John, who in the end prevailed.{{sfn|Barlow|1999|p=305}}

*[[Alfonso X of Castile]] wished to enforce primogeniture by the ''[[Siete Partidas]]'' in the late 1270s and bequeath his crown to [[Alfonso de la Cerda|Alfonso]], the son of his deceased eldest son, [[Ferdinand de la Cerda|Ferdinand]]. His second but eldest surviving son, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho]], rebelled with the support of the nobility and successfully claimed the crown by degree of kinship.{{sfn|Previté-Orton|1975|p=831}}

*In 1307 a dispute erupted over the [[County of Artois]] between [[Mahaut, Countess of Artois|Mahaut]], who had succeeded her father, [[Robert II, Count of Artois|Robert II]], in 1302, and Mahaut's nephew, [[Robert III of Artois|Robert]]. Robert II had outlived his son, [[Philip of Artois|Philip]], and Mahaut put herself forward as "the closest relative to our said father at the time of his death, the reason of propinquity or proximity being notorious in custom". Her nephew, Philip's son, insisted on "representation of our aforesaid father who was the first born of our same grandfather". His appeal was rejected in 1309 on the basis that the established custom of Artois favored Mahaut, but he never relinquished his claim.{{sfn|Wood|1966|p=60}}

*[[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy|Odo IV]], having outlived his son [[Philip I, Count of Auvergne|Philip]], decreed in his will in 1348 that he should be succeeded by his grandson, also named [[Philip I, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]], unless Odo fathered another son. Odo's grandson, however, should have precedence over any daughters Odo might have and over Odo's sisters. In case of Philip's death without issue, the duchy was to pass to Odo's youngest but sole surviving sister, [[Joan the Lame|Joan]], rather than to the descendants of his deceased older sisters.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}} Odo IV had no further sons and was succeeded by his grandson, Philip I. Philip died childless in 1361, having outlived his grandfather's last sibling, Joan. The duchy would have gone to [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of Odo's older sister [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret]], according to primogeniture, but was successfully claimed by [[John II of France]], son of the younger sister Joan, according to proximity of blood. Since Charles was the grandson of a sister of Odo and John was the son of another, the latter was one degree closer to the dukes of Burgundy than Charles.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

*During the reign of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] it was never resolved whether his heir should be his younger sister, [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden|Ulrika Eleonora]], or his nephew, [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Charles Frederick]] (the son of his deceased elder sister, [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden|Hedwig Sophia]]).{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=132, 393}} The sister was more closely related to the reigning king, but the nephew had precedence according to primogeniture.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=371}} Upon Charles XII's death in 1718 it was Ulrika Eleonora who successfully claimed the crown.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=}}

=== Unsuccessful applications ===

*In 1269, upon the death of [[Conrad III of Jerusalem]], [[Mary of Antioch]] and [[Hugh III of Cyprus]] both claimed the crown. She was the daughter of [[Melisende of Lusignan|Melisende]], fifth daughter of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]], while he was the grandson of [[Alice of Champagne|Alice]], second daughter of Isabella I. Mary the only living grandchild of Isabella I and closer in kinship to Conrad III (first cousin twice removed) and the [[kings of Jerusalem]], while Hugh had precedence by [[primogeniture]] but was more distantly related to Conrad III (second cousin) and Isabella I (great-grandchild). The [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] decided in favour of Hugh but Mary did not relinquish her claim.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|p=328-329}}

*[[Alexander III of Scotland]] drafted a treaty in 1281 in which he set out the rules of succession among his descendants. The provisions appeared to favor primogeniture for male heirs but proximity of blood for female heirs; the son of a deceased older son would take precedence over a surviving younger son but a younger daughter over a deceased older daughter's children.{{sfn|Duncan|2002|p=166-169}} Upon the death of his granddaughter and successor, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]], in 1290, the succession was [[Great Cause|unclear]]. [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert de Brus]] claimed the crown by proximity in degree of kinship to the [[kings of Scotland]],{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}} while [[John Balliol]] made a claim based on primogeniture.{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Robert and John were both descended from [[David, Earl of Huntingdon|David of Huntingdon]] (grandson of [[David I of Scotland]]); Robert was a grandson (son of [[Isobel of Huntingdon|Isobel]], second daughter of David of Huntingdon) while John was a great-grandson (grandson of [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Lady of Galloway|Margaret]], first daughter of David of Huntingdon).{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Arbitration by [[Edward I of England]] awarded the throne to John, but Robert's grandson later successfully claimed the crown as [[Robert I of Scotland]].{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}}

The '''royal prerogative''' is a body of customary authority, privilege, and immunity, recognized in [[common law]] and, sometimes, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions possessing a monarchy, as belonging to the [[monarch|sovereign]] and which have become widely vested in the government.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Commonwealth realms]], the wording ''[[the crown]]'' is usually used in this context instead of ''king'' or ''queen''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the means by which some of the [[executive (government)|executive]] powers of government, possessed by and vested in a monarch with regard to the process of governance of the state, are carried out.

==Evolution==
In most [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], prerogatives can be abolished by Parliament as the courts apply the constitutional near-absolute of the [[supremacy of Parliament]]. In the [[Commonwealth realms]] this draws on the constitutional statutes at the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]] when [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] were invited to take the throne.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the remaining powers of the royal prerogative are devolved to the head of the government which for more than two centuries has been the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]; the benefits, equally, such as [[mineral rights]] in all gold and silver ores, vest in (belong to) the government.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Case of Mines]]'' [1568] ([[Elizabeth I of England|Regina]] v [[Earl of Northumberland]])&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, prerogative powers were originally exercised by the monarch acting, without an observed requirement for [[Parliament of England|parliament]]ary consent (after its empowerment in certain matters following [[Magna Carta]]). Since the accession of the [[House of Hanover]] these powers have been, with minor exceptions in economically unimportant sectors, exercised on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the [[Prime Minister]] or the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], who are accountable to Parliament, exclusively so, except in matters of the Royal Family, since at least the time of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]].

Typically in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] that are [[constitutional monarchies]] as well as [[nation states]], such as those of [[List of Danish monarchs|Denmark]], [[King of Norway|Norway]], or [[King of Sweden|Sweden]], the royal prerogative serves in practice as a prescribed ceremonial function of the ''state power''.

===Ministerial exercise of the monarch's prerogatives===
Today, prerogative powers fall into two main categories:

*Those directly exercised by ministers without the approval of parliament, including, in some countries, such as the UK the powers to regulate the civil service, issue passports and grant honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/public-administration-select-committee/pasc-19/| title= UK Parliament – PASC 19| publisher= Queen's Printer for Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Those exercised nominally by the monarch, "on the advice of" (that is, by constitutional convention, however so requested by) the [[prime minister]] and on the advice of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. 

Some key areas of government are carried out by the royal prerogative but its usage is falling as functions are progressively made statutory.

==Commonwealth realms==
===Australia===
In Australia, the royal prerogative is vested in the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, and this is included in the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

===Canada===
In Canada, the royal prerogative is, for the most part, the same as that in the United Kingdom, as constrained by constitutional convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hicks| first=Bruce M.| year=2010| title=British and Canadian Experience with the royal prerogative| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=Summer 2010| pages=18–24| publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/sites/lop/infoparl/33/2/33n2_10e_Hicks.pdf| accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its exercise is usually through the federal [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]] or the [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]]s of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] in their respective [[privy council]]s. The royal prerogative in Canada is largely set out in Part III of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], particularly section 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-2.html#anchorbo-ga:s_9 Canada Department of Justice, ''Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Law Times"&gt;{{cite news| title= War power and the royal prerogative| publisher=Law Times| date=2006-05-01| url=http://www.lawtimesnews.com/20060501549/Headline-News/War-power-and-the-Royal-Prerogative| accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As foreign affairs are a matter of royal prerogative,&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0860-e.htm#TheRoyal| last=Barnett| first=Laura| last2=Spano| first2=Sebastian| editor-last=Libaray of Parliament| title=Parliamentary Involvement in Foreign Policy| date=10 November 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the power to declare war and deploy the [[Canadian Forces|armed forces]] belongs to the Crown, though only in its [[Cabinet of Canada|federal Cabinet]] (the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]), as outlined in sections 9 and 15 of the Constitution Act, 1867.&lt;ref name="Law Times"/&gt; Neither legislation nor any other type of parliamentary approval, beyond budgetary matters, is required for such actions, though the Cabinet has on occasion consulted parliament before engaging Canada or extending Canada's involvement in a conflict.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt; Additionally, the federal and provincial crowns may ratify treaties, though only so far as they fall within the proper area of jurisdiction, according to sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Again, the endorsement of parliament is not necessary for these agreements to have force in an international sense, but the legislatures must pass treaties in order for them to have domestic effect. Proposed treaties have also occasionally been presented to parliament for debate before ratification.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt; Members of Parliament have tabled bills seeking to curtail the use of the royal prerogative in foreign affairs by legislating a greater role for parliament, as have [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] standing committees, from time to time, called for the same.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt;

[[Canadian passport#Rights to a passport|The issuance of passports]] also remains within the royal prerogative in Canada. The terms for the issuing of passports by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Crown are set out in the Canadian Passport Order,&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Passport Order'', SI/81-86.&lt;/ref&gt; issued by the Governor General-in-Council. The Canadian government has used the royal prerogative on two occasions to deny a passport to a Canadian citizen, [[Abdurahman Khadr]] and [[Fateh Kamel]]. Lawsuits filed at the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]], [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], and ultimately the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] did not find in favour of either Khadr, nor Kamel.

The royal prerogative in Canada extends also to the granting of honours, as explained by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] in [[Black v. Chrétien]] (regarding [[Conrad Black]]'s entitlement to an appointment to the [[House of Lords]] while a Canadian citizen).&lt;ref name="Law Times"/&gt; Other royal prerogatives, such as the prerogative of mercy, also exist in the Canadian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cloverdale ARPA| url=http://arpacanada.ca/index.php/issuesresearch/pro-life/81-latimers-appeal-for-the-royal-prerogative-of-mercy| title=Latimer's Appeal for the royal prerogative of Mercy| publisher=ARPA Canada| date=| accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom}}

In the [[Kingdom of England]] (up to 1707), the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (1707–1800), and the [[United Kingdom]] (since 1801), the royal prerogative was one of the central features of the [[Commonwealth realm|realm]]'s governance.

Constitutional theorist [[A. V. Dicey]] gives the standard definition of what prerogative powers as follows:

{{quote|... the remaining portion of the Crown's original authority, and it is therefore ... the name for the residue of discretionary power left at any moment in the hands of the Crown, whether such power be in fact exercised by the King himself or by his Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/422/42204.htm House of Commons – Public Administration – Fourth Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The scope of the royal prerogative is difficult to determine due to the [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]] nature of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution]]. It is clear that the existence and extent of the power is a matter of the [[common law of England]], making the courts the final arbiter of whether a particular type of prerogative exists or not. Nevertheless, certain prerogative powers have been widely acknowledged and accepted over time, while others have fallen out of use.

The royal prerogative is not constitutionally unlimited. In the [[Case of Proclamations]] (1611) during the reign of King [[James I of England|James VI/I]], English common law courts judges emphatically asserted that they possessed the right to determine the limits of the royal prerogative. Since the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which brought co-monarchs [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[William III of England|King William III]] to power, this interpretation of there being a separate and distinct power of the Judiciary has not been challenged by [[the Crown]]. It has been accepted that it is emphatically the province of the court(s) to say what the law is, or means. This is a crucial corollary and foundation to the concept of the judicial power; and its distinct and separate nature from the executive power possessed by the Crown itself, or its ministers.

====British dependencies====
Generally, [[the Crown]] retains all the power of the state in a Crown colony (even if in practice it is not directly exercised), which was later renamed ‘dependent territory’ in 1983 and has been known as ‘overseas territory’ since 2002.  Thus the royal prerogative is in theory an unlimited, arbitrary authority.&lt;ref&gt;[[Campbell v. Hall]], 1774&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[British overseas territories]] however, each inhabited territory has a constitution by which the territory is governed locally.

The absoluteness of the royal prerogative in the colonies was however defeated in the case of ''[[Campbell v. Hall]]'' in 1774. This case decided that once a colony gained a representative assembly (or once the governor has been instructed to call one), the royal authority is limited to the familiar prerogatives; without the assembly's consent the Crown could not raise taxation nor change the law. Several of the colonies of the British West Indies thus became "settled colonies", and reverted to "crown colony" status only by Act of Parliament in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. The St. Vincent and Grenada Constitution Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 47)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009 the government of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], a UK dependency, was revested in the [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governor]], on the advice of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]], under an [[Order in Council]]&lt;ref&gt;The Turks and Caicos Islands Constitution (Interim Amendment) Order 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of 18 March 2009, which suspended and amended parts of the Islands' constitution, and vacated all the offices of [[Government minister|ministers]] and the House of Assembly. This was not itself an exercise of the royal prerogative, as it was made under "the West Indies Act 1962 and of all other powers enabling Her to do so". However, in effect the order extended the royal prerogative in the Islands, vesting wide discretionary legislative and executive powers in [[Majesty|Her Majesty]]'s governor. The governor remains subject to the amended constitution, and in practice to the instructions of [[Queen regent|the Queen]]'s [[Foreign Office]] in the UK.

In the case of the [[Chagos Archipelago]], in 2000, the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] ruled that a local ordinance made by the Commissioner of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] exiling the islanders was unlawful, a decision which was accepted by the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Robin Cook]]. That Order was legislation passed under authority given by the royal prerogative, not an exercise of the prerogative itself, and was overturned as being beyond the powers given. After this decision, the British government issued an [[Order in Council]], a primary exercise of the royal prerogative, to achieve the same objective. This Order was also ruled unlawful by the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]], a ruling upheld in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].  However, on Wednesday, 22 October 2008, the government won its appeal in the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] against the previous rulings. The House decided by a three-to-two majority that the Order in Council was a lawful exercise of authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hdjVkpT6_bzQxOkAQiXHQRIerOtw Britain wins appeal over Chagos islanders' return home]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAGxtNEsx6bLfJqWoxpoftSmC98A Chagos islanders cannot return home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026013052/http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAGxtNEsx6bLfJqWoxpoftSmC98A |date=26 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their speeches, the Law Lords admitted the government of the day was morally wrong to force out some 2,000 residents of the Chagos Archipelago, a British Crown colony, to make way for a US air base in the 1960s. Nevertheless, the majority could not find legal fault in the Order.

===Other Commonwealth realms===
In the other [[Commonwealth realms]], the royal prerogative can be or is specifically mandated to be exercised by the monarch's representative, the [[governor-general]]. The [[constitution]] of a Commonwealth realm may sharply limit the prerogative and many governmental acts which would be done under the prerogative in other countries are given effect by the constitution or Acts of Parliament in the Commonwealth realm.

==Spain==
{{See also|Monarchy of Spain}}

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], Title II ''The Crown'', Article 62, delineates the powers of the king, while Title IV ''Government and Administration'', Article 99, defines the king's role in government.&lt;ref name="Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78"&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_04 Título II.

Receiving government advice does not necessarily bind the monarch into executing the advice, except where prescribed by the constitution.

The '''Rule in Dumpor's Case''' is a [[common law]] rule of [[property law]] first set forth by Sir [[Edward Coke]] in 1578 ([[Case citation|4 Coke 1196]] [1578]).  In its most basic form, it states that once a [[landlord]] has consented to an [[Assignment (law)|assignment]] of a [[leasehold estate|tenant]]'s interest in a [[leasehold estate]], he implicitly consents to all future assignments by the tenant.

This rule is still operative in some [[U.S. states]] and some other jurisdictions which follow English common law, but the parties may [[contract]] around the rule by putting a clause in the [[Rental agreement|lease agreement]] which allows the landlord to reserve his right to approve or disapprove an assignment.

The '''school leaving age''' is the minimum age a person is legally allowed to cease attendance at an institute of [[compulsory education|compulsory]] [[secondary education]]. Most countries have their school leaving age set the same as their minimum full-time employment age, thus allowing smooth transition from education into employment, whilst a few have it set just below the age at which a person is allowed to be employed.

In contrast, there are numerous countries that have several years between their school leaving age and their legal minimum employment age, thus in some cases preventing any such transition for several years. Countries which have their employment age set below the school leaving age of 5 years old but  (mostly developing countries), risk giving children the opportunity to leave their education early to earn money for their families.

==Leaving age by country==
Some countries have different leaving or employment ages, but in certain countries like China and Japan, the average age at which people graduate is 15, depending upon part-time or full-time learning or employment. The table below states the school leaving ages in countries across the world and their respective minimum employment age, showing a comparison of how many countries have synchronised these ages. All information is taken from the Right to Education Project's table unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/279 |title=Country Table - At What Age?...are school-children employed, married and taken to court|publisher=The Right to Education Project|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, all children between those ages, even if they're refugees or new, have to attend school.
Not attending school with-out proper reason for example; sickness or a doctors visit, is illegal and is seen as wagging which is seen as fraud and punishable by law. Until the age of 12 children cannot be punished by law, but as soon as your child or you turn 12 years of age or older, you can be held responsible for wagging.
Punishments can be done as a fine, temporary jail time or a community service job done under supervision. Fines can be up to € 3 900 00.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2743">A '''select committee''' is a [[committee]] made up of a small number of [[member of parliament|parliamentary members]] appointed to deal with particular areas or issues originating in the [[Westminster system]] of [[parliamentary democracy]]. Select committees exist in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], as well as in other parliaments based on the Westminster model, such as those in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]].

It is a special [[subcommittee]] of a legislature or assembly governed under a [[committee|committee system]], like ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]''. They are often investigative in nature, collecting data or evidence for a law or problem, and will dissolve immediately&lt;ref&gt;In [[Italy]] the Constitutional Court, in its judgment no. 241 of 2007, stated that, at the ending of a Committee, its legal standing is absorbed by the House as a whole: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Caso Ilaria Alpi: quando la leale collaborazione tra poteri dello Stato è tradita (e non dai magistrati)|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2008| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89405520}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after they report their findings to their superiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.education2020.com/activities/vocab.aspx?keystr=12810&amp;order=03010405&amp;stbl=2196465] -  Education 2020, definition of "select committee"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67280">{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of law''' (or '''legal sociology''') is often described as a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] or an interdisciplinary approach within [[jurisprudence|legal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For various definitions of the sociology of law,see Ehrlich 1936 (orig 1912); Timasheff 1939; Pound 1943; Selznick 1965, Aubert 1969 and 1980, Black 1972, Stjernquist 1983, Hydén 1986, Tomasic 1987, Ferrari 1989, Podgorecki 1991, Cotterrell 1992, Banakar 2003 and 2011; Mathiesen 2005, Deflem 2008, Travers 2009, Nelken 2009, Scuro 2010, Banakar and Travers 2013, Banakar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see sociology of law as belonging "necessarily" to the field of sociology,&lt;ref&gt;See Deflem 2008:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others tend to consider it a field of research caught up between the disciplines of [[law]] and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003 and 2009, Banakar and Travers 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others regard it neither a subdiscipline of sociology nor a branch of legal studies but as a field of research on its own right within the broader social science tradition. Accordingly, it may be described without reference to mainstream sociology as "the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as a set of social practices or as an aspect or field of social experience".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as treating law and justice as fundamental institutions of the basic structure of society mediating "between political and economic interests, between culture and the normative order of society, establishing and maintaining interdependence, and constituting themselves as sources of consensus, coercion and social control".&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrespective of whether sociology of law is defined as a sub-discipline of sociology, an approach within legal studies or a field of research in its own right, it remains intellectually dependent mainly on the traditions, methods and theories of mainstream [[sociology]] and, to a lesser extent, on other [[social sciences]] such as [[social anthropology]], [[political science]], [[social policy]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. As such, it reflects social theories and employs social scientific methods to study [[law]], [[legal institutions]] and legal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Travers 2005, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, sociology of law consists of various approaches to the study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976; Cotterrell 1992; Hunt 1993; Santos 2002; Banakar 2003; Banakar and Travers 2002; Ferrari 1989; Luhmann 1985; Trevino 2008; Travers 2009, Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of legal institutions, forms of [[social control]], legal [[regulation]], the interaction between [[legal culture]]s, the social construction of legal issues, [[legal profession]] and the relation between law and [[social change]].

Sociology of law also benefits from and occasionally draws on research conducted within other fields such as [[comparative law]], [[critical legal studies]], [[jurisprudence]], [[legal theory]], [[law and economics]] and [[law and literature]]. Its object encompasses the historical movement of law and justice and their relentless contemporary construction such as in the field of jurisprudence focused on institutional questions conditioned by social and political situations, in interdisciplinary dominions such as criminology and through analysis of the economic efficiency and the social impact of legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual origins==
[[File:Veber.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Max Weber]]]]
The roots of the sociology of law can be traced back to the works of sociologists and jurists of the turn of the previous century. The relationship between law and society was sociologically explored in the seminal works of both [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]]. The writings on law by these classical sociologists are foundational to the entire sociology of law today.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other scholars, mainly jurists, also employed social scientific theories and methods in an attempt to develop sociological theories of law. Notably among these were [[Leon Petrazycki]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]].

For [[Max Weber]], a so-called "legal rational form" as a type of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a [[rational-legal authority]]. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on Weber's typology see Kronman 1983: 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with [[restitution]] and [[damages|compensation]] grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies in which there is a high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of [[Durkheim|Durkheim's]] sociology of law see Cotterrell 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law'', [[Eugen Ehrlich]] developed a sociological approach to the study of law by focusing on how social networks and groups organized social life.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich 1936 (orig. 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the relationship between law and general social norms and distinguished between "positive law," consisting of the compulsive norms of state requiring official enforcement, and "living law," consisting of the rules of conduct that people in fact obeyed and which dominated social life. The latter emerged spontaneously as people interacted with each other to form social associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegert 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The centre of gravity of legal development therefore from time immemorial has not lain in the activity of the state, but in society itself, and must be sought there at the present time".|Eugen Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, 1936: 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was subjected to criticism by the advocates of legal positivism such as the jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] for its distinction between "law created by the state and law produced by the organisational imperatives of non-state social associations".&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelsen, Ehrlich had confused ''Sein'' ("is") and ''Sollen'' ("ought").&lt;ref&gt;For a presentation of this debate and references to the original sources of the debate see van Klink 2006. For an analysis of the debate between Kelsen and Ehrlich see Banakar 2008. Banakar argues that Kelsen could not help but miss the point that Ehrlich was making by his distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109&lt;br&gt;* Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Leon Petrazycki]]]]
[[Leon Petrazycki]] distinguished between forms of "official law," supported by the state, and "intuitive law," consisting of legal experiences that, in turn, consist of a complex of psychic processes in the mind of the individual with no reference to outside authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrazycki1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrazycki's work addressed sociological problems and his method was empirical, since he maintained that one could gain knowledge of objects or relationships only by observation. However, he couched his theory in the language of cognitive psychology and moral philosophy rather than sociology. Consequently, his contribution to the development of sociology of law remains largely unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2006; also see Podgórecki 1980; Kurczewski 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Petrazycki's "intuitive law" influenced not only the development of Georges Gurvitch's concept of "social law" (see below), which in turn has left its mark on socio-legal theorising, but also the work of later socio-legal scholars. Among those who were directly inspired by Petrazycki's work is the Polish legal sociologist [[Adam Podgórecki]].&lt;ref&gt;See Podgórecki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Geiger]] developed a close-knit analysis of the Marxist theory of law. He highlighted how law becomes a "factor in social transformation in democratic societies of the kind that are governed by the consent expressed by universal suffrage of the population practised at regular intervals".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger went on to develop the salient characteristics of his antimetaphysical thinking, until he exceeded it with practical [[nihilism]]. Geiger's nihilism of values paved the way for a form of [[legal nihilism]], which encourages the construction of a sober democracy "that is capable of raising conflict to the intellectual level and of anaesthetising feelings, as it is aware of its own inability to make any proclamation of value, ethics or policy about the nature of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Gurvitch]] was interested in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction. His aim was to devise the concept of "social law" as a law of integration and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;see Gurvitch, Georges, ''L'idée du droit social'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Gurvitch's social law was an integral part of his general sociology. "It is also one of the early sociological contributions to the theory of legal pluralism, since it challenged all conceptions of law based on a single source of legal, political, or moral authority".&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the sociology of law had an early reception in Argentina. As a local movement of legal scholars steeming from the work of Carlos Cossio, South American researchers have focused on comparative law and sociological insights, constitutional law and society, human rights, and psycho-social approaches to the legal practices.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Lista, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological approaches to the study of law==

===Modern sociology of law===
The sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the emergence of the "sociological movement" in law after World War II see Deflem 2009: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of [[Talcott Parsons]], for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Cotterrell 1992: 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as [[Philip Selznick]], argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Selznik, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]], developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of [[pure sociology]]. Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the [[autopoietic system]]s theory of the German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]], who presents law or "the legal system" as one of the ten ''function systems'' (see [[Differentiation (sociology)|functional differentiation]]) of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Luhmann 2004 and 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth and Schutz 2015"&gt;[[Steffen Roth]] and Anton Schutz: ''Ten systems. Toward a canon of function systems.'' In: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing'', Vol. 22, No. 4., 2015. Vorversion verfügbar (englisch; [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508950 online] auf ssrn.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|All collective human life is directly or indirectly shaped by law. Law is like knowledge, an essential and all-pervasive fact of the social condition.|Niklas Luhmann, ''A Sociological Theory of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, 1985: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] disagrees with Luhmann and argues that the law can do a better job as a 'system' institution' by representing more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional ''habitus'' of the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his associates (often influenced by [[Petrazycki]]'s ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by [[Per Stjernquist]], and in Norway by [[Vilhelm Aubert]].

In more recent years, a very wide range of theories has emerged in the sociology of law as a result of the proliferation of theories in sociology at large. Among the recent influences can be mentioned the work of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]], [[neo-Marxism]], and [[behaviorism]]. The variety of theoretical influences in the sociology of law has also marked the broader law and society field. The multi-disciplinary law and society field remains very popular, while the disciplinary speciality field of the sociology of law is also "better organized than ever in institutional and professional respects".&lt;ref&gt;Deflem 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Society===
Law and Society is an American movement, which was established after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had a vested interest in the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by [[Lawrence Friedman]]: "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986:780.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders believed that the "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods".&lt;ref&gt;Austin et al, 1998:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Law and Society Association]] in 1964 and of the ''Law and Society Review'' in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.&lt;ref&gt;See Munger 1998 and Simon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one view, the main difference between the sociology of law and Law and Society is that the latter does not limit itself theoretically or methodologically to sociology and tries instead to accommodate insights from all social science disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an example see Friedman 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; "Not only does it provides a home for sociologists and social anthropologists and political scientists with an interest in law, it also tries to incorporate psychologists and economists who study law."&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From another point of view, both sociology of law and Law and Society should be seen as multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary enterprises although sociology of law has special ties to the methods, theories and traditions of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s a number of original empirical studies were conducted by Law and Society scholars on conflict and dispute resolution. In his early work, [[Bill Felstiner|William Felstiner]], for example, focused on alternative ways to solve conflicts (avoidance, mediation, litigation etc.). Together with [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]] and [[Austin Sarat]], Felstiner developed the idea of a disputes pyramid and the formula "naming, blaming, claiming", which refers to different stages of conflict resolution and levels of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;"See, Felstiner, Abel and Sarat 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological jurisprudence===
The sociology of law is often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some of the debates within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faigman|first=David L.|title=Laboratory of Justice: The Supreme Court's 200-Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Henry Holt |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Roscoe. "Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence." ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 24 (1910): 591. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid E. Rumble, Jr., "Legal Realism, Sociological Jurisprudence and Mr. Justice Holmes," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1965) 26#4 pp. 547-566 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708499 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and the Russian-French sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinguishing between different branches of the social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse the development of the sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful for the development of the field as whole. For the social scientific studies of law to transcend the theoretical and empirical limits, which currently define their scope, they need to go beyond such artificial distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-legal studies==
'Socio-legal studies' in the UK has grown mainly out of the interest of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a methodological approach, it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not, therefore, be confused with the legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services'&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that it "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001: 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include [[Carol Smart|Professor Carol Smart]], co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building#External links|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]], (named after the sociologist, [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]]), as well as [[Mavis Maclean|Professor Mavis Maclean]] and [[John Eekelaar]] who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP).

'''Socio-legal methods of investigation'''

The sociology of law has no methods of investigation which have been developed specifically for conducting socio-legal research. Instead, it employs a wide variety of social scientific methods, including qualitative and quantitative research techniques, to explore law and legal phenomena. Positivistic&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interpretive (such as discourse analysis) and ethnographic&lt;ref&gt;See Travers 1997, Flood 2005 and 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; approaches to data collection and analysis is used within the socio-legal field.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of various methods see Banakar and Travers 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of law in Britain==
Sociology of law was a small, but developing, sub-field of British sociology and legal scholarship at the time when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.

'''Symbolic interactionism and Marxism'''

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionism]] had become popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a politically radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing society as a system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Becker 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused on the process of law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paterson 1982; Flood 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential sociological approach during this period was, however, Marxism—which claimed to offer a scientific and comprehensive understanding of society as a whole in the same way as structural-functionalism, although with the emphasis on the struggle between different groups for material advantage, rather than value-consensus. This approach caught the imagination of many people with left-wing political views in law schools, but it also generated some interesting empirical studies. These included historical studies about how particular
statutes were used to advance the interests of dominant economic groups, and also Pat Carlen's memorable ethnography,&lt;ref&gt;Pat Carlen 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined analytic resources from Marxism and interactionism, especially the sociology of Erving Goffman, in writing about magistrates' courts.

'''The Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies'''

The 1980s were also a fruitful time for empirical sociology of law in Britain, mainly
because Donald Harris deliberately set out to create the conditions for a fruitful
exchange between lawyers and sociologists at the [[University of Oxford]] Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was fortunate enough to recruit a number of young and
talented social scientists, including J. Maxwell Atkinson and Robert Dingwall who were interested in ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociology
of the professions, and Doreen McBarnet who became something of a cult figure on the left after publishing her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Doreen McBarnet 1981&lt;/ref&gt; which advanced a particularly clear and vigorous Marxist analysis of the criminal justice system. Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches have a lot in common when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a sociologist at the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Drew, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest developed at Oxford during this period was the sociology of the professions. Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; edited what remains an interesting and theoretically diverse collection, bringing together specialists from the sociology of law and medicine. The best known study to date has, however, been published by the American scholar [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;Abel 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who employed ideas and concepts from functionalist, Marxist, and Weberian
sociology to explain the high incomes and status that British lawyers enjoyed for most of the twentieth century.

'''Recent developments'''

Since the 1980s, relatively few empirical studies of law and legal institutions have been conducted by British sociologists, i.e. studies which are empirical and at the same time engage with the theoretical concerns of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some exceptions. To begin with, sociology of law, along with so many areas of academic work, has been enlivened and renewed through engagement with feminism. There has been a great deal of
interest in the implications of Foucault's ideas on governmentality for understanding
law,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Wickham 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and also in continental thinkers such as Niklas Luhmann and Pierre Bourdieu. Again, one can argue that rather fewer empirical studies have been produced than one might have hoped, but a great deal of interesting work has been published.

A second exception is to be found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1997; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.

Despite the relatively limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law have been important in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from [[David Nelken]] exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and the potential of the idea of legal cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2004; 2007; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cotterrell]] seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars, such as [[David Schiff]] and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory and the extent to which law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social.&lt;ref&gt;Nobles and Schiff 2006; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.

==Devising a sociological concept of law==
In contrast to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on [[law]]), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The rule-based aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009; Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, legal sociology regards law as a set of institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar and Travers 2005 and Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example [[Eugen Ehrlich]]'s concept of "living law" and [[Georges Gurvitch]]'s "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of legal pluralism see Dalberg-Larsen 2000; Merry 1988; Chiba 1989; John Griffiths 1986; Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western sociology of law==

The interest in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Deva, 2005; Baxi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but we find only a limited amount of socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier overview of the field, see Ferrari, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the disparity between Western and non-Western sociology of law see Banakar 2011 at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary perspectives==

===Legal pluralism===
[[Legal pluralism]] is a concept developed by legal sociologists and social anthropologists "to describe multiple layers of law, usually with different sources of legitimacy, that exist within a single state or society".&lt;ref&gt;Olgiati 2007; also see Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also defined "as a situation in which two or more legal systems coexist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Engle Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralists define law broadly to include not only the system of courts and judges backed by the coercive power of the state, but also the "non-legal forms of normative ordering".&lt;ref&gt;Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralism consists of many different methodological approaches and as a concept, it embraces "diverse and often contested perspectives on law, ranging from the recognition of different legal orders within the nation-state, to a more far reaching and open-ended concept of law that does not necessarily depend on state recognition for validity. This latter concept of law may come into being whenever two or more legal systems exist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The ideology of legal positivism has had such a powerful hold on the imagination of lawyers and social scientists that its picture of the legal world has been able successfully to masquerade as fact and has formed the foundation stone of social and legal theory.|John Griffiths, "What is Legal Pluralism"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, 1986:5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal pluralism has occupied a central position in socio-legal theorising from the very beginning of the sociology of law. The sociological theories of [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]] were early sociological contributions to legal pluralism. It has, moreover, provided the most enduring topic of socio-legal debate over many decades within both the sociology of law and legal anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and has received more than its share of criticism from the proponents of the various schools of [[legal positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Tamanaha 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics often ask: "How is law distinguished in a pluralist view from other normative systems? What makes a social rule system legal?".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy arises mainly "from the claim that the only true law is the law made and enforced by the modern state".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This standpoint is also known as "legal centralism". From a legal centralist standpoint, John Griffiths writes, "law is and should be the law of the state, uniform for all persons, exclusive of all other law, and administrated by a single set of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to legal centralism, "customary laws and religious laws are not properly called 'law' except in so far as state has chosen to adopt and treat any such normative order as part of its own law".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between the "weak" and the "strong" versions of legal pluralism. The "weak" version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of "legal centralism", but only recognises that within the domain of the Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths, 2002: 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "weak" version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…".&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha 1993: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong" version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion,"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter 1981: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism directed at legal pluralism often uses the basic assumptions of legal positivism to question the validity of theories of legal pluralism which aim at criticising those very (positivistic) assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roger Cotterrell]] explains, the pluralist conception should be understood as part of "the legal sociologist's effort to broaden perspectives on law. A legal sociologist's specification of law might be different from that presupposed by a lawyer in practice, but it will relate (indeed, in some way incorporate) the latter because it must (if it is to reflect legal experience) take account of lawyers' perspectives on law. Thus a pluralist approach in legal theory is likely to recognise what lawyers typically recognize as law, but may see this law as one species of a larger genus, or treat lawyers' conception of law as reflecting particular perspectives determined by particular objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopoiesis===
[[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] originally coined the concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by [[Niklas Luhmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ziegert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising a solution to the problem of the humanised 'subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most challenging idea incorporated in the theory of autopoiesis is that social systems should not be defined in terms of human agency or norms, but of communications. Communication is in turn the unity of utterance, information and understanding and constitutes social systems by recursively reproducing communication. This sociologically radical thesis, which raises the fear of a dehumanised theory of law and society, attempts to highlight the fact that social systems are constituted by communicative."&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Max Travers 2005: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Cotterrell]], "Luhmann... treats the theory as the basis for all general sociological analysis of social systems and their mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret whatever this research may discover."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cultures===
[[Legal culture]] is one of the central concepts of the sociology of law. The study of legal cultures may, at the same time, be regarded as one of the general approaches within the sociology of law.

As a concept, it refers to "relatively stable patterns of legally-oriented social behaviour and attitudes," and as such is regarded as a subcategory of the concept of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelken, 2004: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new concept which, according to [[David Nelken]], can be traced to "terms like legal tradition or legal style, which have a much longer history in comparative law or in early political science. It presupposes and invites us to explore the existence of systematic variations in patterns in 'law in the books' and 'law in action,' and, above all, in the relation between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an approach, it focuses on the cultural aspects of law, legal behaviour and legal institutions and, thus, has affinity with [[cultural anthropology]], legal pluralism, and [[comparative law]].

[[Lawrence M. Friedman]] is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 193. But for criticism of the vagueness of this and other formulations of the concept of legal culture in sociology of law, see Cotterrell, 2006, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.

===Feminism===
Law has always been regarded as one of the important sites of engagement for feminism. As pointed out by Ruth Fletcher feminist engagement with the law has taken many forms through the years, which also indicates their successful merging of theory and practice: "Through litigation, campaigns for reform and legal education, feminists have engaged explicitly with law and the legal profession. In taking on the provisions of specialist advice services, women's groups have played a role in making law accessible to those in need. By subjecting legal concepts and methods to critical analysis, feminists have questioned the terms of legal debate."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Globalization]] is often defined in terms of economic processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth&lt;ref&gt;Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkmar Gessner&lt;ref&gt;Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the relatively early empirical studies see Dezalay and Garth 1996. For a collection of empirical studies of law and globalization see Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pointed out by Halliday and Osinsky, "[[Economic globalization]] cannot be understood apart from global business regulation and the legal construction of the markets on which it increasingly depends. Cultural globalization cannot be explained without attention to intellectual property rights institutionalized in law and global governance regimes. The globalization of protections for vulnerable populations cannot be comprehended without tracing the impact of international criminal and humanitarian law or international tribunals. Global contestation over the institutions of democracy and state building cannot be meaningful unless considered in relation to constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday and Osinsk 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socio-legal approaches to the study of globalization and global society often overlap with, or make use of, studies of legal cultures and legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;See Teubner 1996; Feest and Nelken 2007, Friedman and Perez-Perdomo 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-90's every year the law firm Surana and Surana International Attorneys have hosted, administered &amp; sponsored over a  hundred  moot court competitions (the count is till 2013 and continuing) in partnership with India's  leading law schools. This project is one of the largest of its kind in the world by any law firm. In the academic initiatives taken by corporates, Surana &amp; Surana stands as a benchmark in the whole legal fraternity. Probably this is what it means to be called as the "Pioneers of moot court competitions in India".

==History==
The '''Surana and Surana Moots''' project was initiated by the founder of Surana and Surana International Attorneys, P.S.Surana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtnext.in/News/City/2016/04/23234516/Dont-lose-principles-for-quick-money.vpf&lt;/ref&gt; One day in the late 80's, Honb'le Justice Krishna Iyer during his stay with the Surana family, spoke at length about the need to nurture young advocates with good advocacy skills. He was also concerned about the fact that bright young law graduates were joining the corporate sector, thereby depriving the Bar of a steady flow of good talent. This prompted  Mr. Surana  to plan  a well structured  &amp; transparent moot court competition platform for  law students  to develop skills in oral and  written  advocacy  as well as legal research. The cases prepared for the competitions are based on either emerging or unsettled areas of law. This requires participants to come up with innovative arguments which in turn helps develop new jurisprudence. Members of the higher &amp; lower judiciary have participated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International moot court competition starts at PU|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/international-moot-court-competition-starts-at-pu/411754/|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in these moots  and have greatly  appreciated  the efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moot Court contests conclude|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100906/cth1.htm|publisher=Tribune Chandigarh|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Surana &amp; Surana in developing legal skills among  generations of  budding lawyers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20815">[[File:Akiyoshicave.jpg|thumb|Fuller's hypothetical case involves a group of [[caving|cave explorers]] who are trapped following a [[cave-in]] and face the risk of death from starvation.  The case examines how the rescued survivors, who kill and eat one person in order to survive, should be treated by the law.]]

"'''The Case of the Speluncean Explorers'''" is an article by legal philosopher [[Lon L. Fuller]] first published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1949. Largely taking the form of a fictional judgment, it presents a [[jurisprudence|legal philosophy]] puzzle to the reader and five possible solutions in the form of [[judicial opinion]]s that are attributed to judges sitting on the fictional "Supreme Court of Newgarth" in the year 4300.{{efn|Fuller addressed his decision to date his scenario in the [[fifth millennium]] in the article's postscript, writing that "the reader puzzled by the choice of date may wish to be reminded that the centuries which separate us from the year 4300 are roughly equal to those that have passed since the [[Fifth-century Athens|Age of Pericles]] [i.e. the fifth century]".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=645}} }}

The case involves five explorers who are caved in following a landslide. They learn via intermittent radio contact that, without food, they are likely to starve to death before they can be rescued. They decide to engage in [[cannibalism]], and select one of their number to be killed and eaten so that the others may survive. They decide who should be killed by throwing a pair of dice.  After the four survivors are rescued, they are charged and found guilty of the [[murder]] of the fifth explorer. If their appeal to the Supreme Court of Newgarth fails, they face a mandatory [[capital punishment|death sentence]]. Although the wording of the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is intense public pressure for the men to avoid facing the death penalty.

The article offers five possible judicial responses. Each differs in its reasoning and on whether the survivors should be found guilty of breaching the law.  Two judges affirm the convictions, emphasising the importance of the [[separation of powers]] and [[Plain meaning rule|literal approach]] to [[statutory interpretation]]. Two other judges overturn the convictions; one focuses on "common sense" and the popular will while the other uses arguments drawn from the [[natural law]] tradition, emphasizing the [[purposive approach]]. A fifth judge, who is unable to reach a conclusion, recuses himself.  As the Court's decision is a tie, the original convictions are upheld and the men are sentenced to death.

Fuller's account has been described as "a classic in [[jurisprudence]]"{{sfn|D'Amato|1980|p=467}} and "a microcosm of [the 20th] century's debates" in legal philosophy.{{sfn|Eskridge Jr.|1993|p=467}}  It allows for contrasts to be drawn between different legal philosophies, with the main two being [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]].  In the 50 years following the article's publication, a further 25 hypothetical judgments were written by various authors whose perspectives include [[natural law]] theory, [[consequentialism]], plain meaning [[positivism]] or [[textualism]], purposivism, historical contextualism, realism, pragmatism, [[critical legal studies]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], [[process theory]] and minimalism.{{sfn|Roederer|2003|p=388}}

==Synopsis==
===Facts===
The facts of the case are recounted in the first judicial opinion, which is given by Chief Justice Truepenny.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1851}}

Five cave explorers became trapped inside a cave following a landslide.  They have limited food supplies and no sources of nutrition inside the cave. Above ground, substantial resources are spent to rescue them, with 10 workmen killed in subsequent landslides near the blocked entrance. Radio contact is eventually established with the cavers on the 20th day of the cave-in, and the cavers learn that another 10 days would be required in order to free them. They then consult with medical experts, who inform them that they are unlikely to survive to the rescue given the likelihood of starvation.

[[File:Two red dice 01.svg|thumb|180px|left|In "the Case of the Speluncean Explorers", the person to be eaten was chosen by throwing a pair of dice. This method had also been suggested for choosing the victim in the similar real-life case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''.]]

One of the cavers, Roger Whetmore, then asks on the cavers' behalf if the cavers could survive 10 days longer "if they consumed the flesh of one of their number". The medical experts reluctantly confirm this to be the case. Whetmore then asks if they should [[sortition|draw lots]] to select a person to be killed and eaten. No one outside the cave is willing to answer this question. Radio contact is subsequently lost.

Once the cave-in is cleared, it is discovered that only four cavers have survived; Roger Whetmore had been killed and eaten by the others. The survivors state that Whetmore had originally come up with the ideas of cannibalism and choosing the victim through random chance, offering a pair of [[dice]] in his possession.

Before the dice are cast, Whetmore allegedly expresses a wish to withdraw from the arrangement, preferring to wait another week "before embracing an expedient so frightful and odious". The others refuse to accept his change of mind, and cast the dice on his behalf. The survivors claim that Whetmore conceded that the dice were thrown fairly. He is subsequently killed and eaten.

Following their rescue and recovery, the survivors are charged with the murder of Whetmore. The relevant statute provides that "Whoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be punished by death", offering no exceptions which would be relevant to the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1853}} The jury seek a [[special verdict]], so that they can make limited findings of fact without having to return a verdict on whether it constitutes murder. The cavers are ultimately convicted of murder.

The [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentence]] for murder in Newgarth is [[death by hanging]]. Both the trial judge and members of the jury petition the Chief Executive to [[Commutation of sentence|commute the sentence]] of the surviving spelunkers from the death penalty to six months' imprisonment. The Chief Executive refuses to act while the Supreme Court of Newgarth considers the appeal.

| Chief Justice Truepenny || 
* Statute is unambiguous and must be applied by judiciary notwithstanding personal views

* Defendants were in a "state of nature" so Newgarth's normal laws did not apply to them; the laws of nature would allow them to agree to sacrifice one's life to save the other four
* If the laws of Newgarth do apply, then a purposive approach must be taken to the statute. Judges can find an exception to the law by implication, as the Courts had earlier done with [[self-defense]].

* Criticises Foster J's approach
** The natural law under the posited "state of nature" prioritises freedom of contract above the right to life

===Opinion of Chief Justice Truepenny===
The first opinion is largely [[Exposition (narrative)|expository]]; it is used to recount the facts of the case.  The Chief Justice states that the statute is unambiguous, with no applicable legal defences, so it must be applied by the court.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=619}}  He adds that granting mercy is a decision for the executive branch of government to make, rather than the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} However, the Chief Justice suggests that the judges of the court should add their names to the petition of the trial judge and jury requesting the Chief Executive to show mercy to the defendants. This would allow justice to be achieved "without impairing either the letter or spirit of our statutes and without offering any encouragement for the disregard of law".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}

===Opinion of Justice Foster===
{{Quote|text=I believe something more is on trial in this case than the fate of these unfortunate explorers; that is the law of our Commonwealth. If this Court declares that under our law these men have committed a crime, then our law is itself convicted in the tribunal of common sense, no matter what happens to the individuals involved in this petition of error. For us to assert that the law we uphold and expound compels us to a conclusion we are ashamed of, and from which we can only escape by appealing to a dispensation resting within the personal whim of the Executive, seems to me to amount to an admission that the law of this Commonwealth no longer pretends to incorporate justice.|sign=Justice Foster{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}}}

The second opinion takes a different approach to the Chief Justice's.  In determining that the convictions should be overturned, Justice Foster makes two main points.  Firstly, the defendants were in a "[[state of nature]]" at the time of the killing, so the laws of nature applied to them. The laws of nature allowed to agree to sacrifice one person for the survival of the rest.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} Secondly, assuming the laws of Newgarth did apply, a {{cfy|text=[[functional approach]]|date=March 2016}} should be used in applying the statute.  As its main purpose is deterrence, the judge concluded that, just as with a case of self-defence, the purpose of the statute would not be served by upholding the convictions.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=624}}

The judge counters potential objections of [[judicial activism]] by suggesting that although judges must obey the will of legislators, they must do so intelligently. He draws analogies to servants who need to "read between the lines" of their masters' instructions; strict literal compliance may not always be the actual intention.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=625}}  Thus the "correction of obvious legislative errors or oversights is not to supplant the legislative will, but to make that will effective."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}}

===Opinion of Justice Tatting===
In the third opinion, Justice Tatting is emotionally "torn between sympathy for [the defendants] and a feeling of abhorrence and disgust at the monstrous act they committed".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}} He ultimately finds himself unable to decide the case.

Justice Tatting disagrees strongly with Justice Foster's rationales in overturning the convictions. He criticizes the "state of nature" concept and is not satisfied with Justice Foster's formulation placing the law of contract above the law against murder.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=627–628}} He also notes the difficulty of applying the [[purposive approach]] to the criminal statute which has multiple purposes, including retribution and rehabilitation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=628–629}} He distinguishes the self-defence exception that was created by past judges on the basis that it is not a "willful" killing, so it does not contradict the wording of the statute.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=629}} He finds that the self-defence exception could not be applied to the present case as it would raise "a quagmire of hidden difficulties".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=630}} 

The judge cites the case of  ''Commonwealth v Valjean'',{{efn|This reference invokes [[Jean Valjean]], the protagonist in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]]''. In the novel, Valjean is imprisoned after stealing bread to feed his sister's starving children.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=70–71}} }} in which starvation was held not to justify the theft of a loaf of bread, let alone homicide. These combined objections lead Justice Tatting to reject Justice Foster's reasoning as "intellectually unsound and approaching mere rationalization."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

Despite rejecting Justice Foster's reasoning, Justice Tatting cannot bring himself to reach the alternative view, that the defendants' convictions should be upheld. He states that "almost every consideration that bears on the decision of the case
is counterbalanced by an opposing consideration leading in the opposite direction."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}} Concluding with a criticism of the prosecutor for deciding to bring the prosecution in the first place, the judge makes the "unprecedented" decision of withdrawing from the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

===Opinion of Justice Keen===
The fourth opinion begins by excluding [[executive clemency]] and the morality of the defendants' actions as relevant factors to the court's deliberations.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} Rather, the question before the court is purely one of applying the legislation of Newgarth and determining whether the defendants wilfully took the life of Whetmore. He criticizes the other judges for failing to distinguish the legal from the moral aspects of the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} While he shares their preference that the defendants be spared from death, he respects the obligations of his office to put his "personal predilections" of what constitutes justice out of mind when interpreting and applying the law.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}}

Justice Keen objects vehemently to Justice Foster's purposive approach allowing the plain words of the law to be ignored.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=67}} He emphasizes that laws may have many possible purposes, with difficulties arising in divining the actual "purpose" of a piece of legislation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}}

Justice Keen recalls that earlier instances of judicial activism in Newgarth had ultimately led to [[civil war]], which established the supremacy of the legislature over the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}} He concludes by criticizing the courts' creation of the self-defence excuse, stating that waiting for the legislature to enact such revisions would have led to a stronger legal system.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}

===Opinion of Justice Handy===
In contrast to the other judges, Justice Handy prefers to use a "pragmatic, common-sense approach", rather than abstract legal theories, to resolve the case.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He criticizes his colleagues' "obscuring curtain of legalisms" when the case simply requires the application of "practical wisdom" of "human realities".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}} He emphasizes the need for the courts to maintain public confidence, which requires them to follow the 90% majority in favour of applying a token punishment or releasing the defendants altogether.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He is prepared to use Justice Foster's purposive approach doctrine as the legal rationale.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}}

Justice Handy notes that apart from the ambivalent Justice Tatting, the other judges share the majority public opinion.  The judges voting to uphold the convictions simply differ from Justices Foster and Handy on whose role it is to spare the defendants from the death penalty.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=642}}

'''''Theory of Legal Norms''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Teoria della Norma Giuridica'') is a book, published in 1958, by the [[Italia]]n [[jurist]] [[Norberto Bobbio]] about one of the [[Ontology|ontological]] elements of [[philosophy of law|foundations of law]] &amp;mdash; the legal norm.

== Importance ==
Seen by scholars as an important work&lt;ref name="UNIN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FILIPPI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Filippi|first=Alberto|last2=Lafer|first2=Celso|title=A Presença de Bobbio|place=São Paulo|publisher=UNESP|year=2004|page=87|isbn=8571395713}}&lt;/ref&gt; in understanding of a conceptual constructivist approach of the [[scientific method|scientific way]] of thinking law in the new era of the [[jurisprudence of values]], Bobbio's book faces this challenge in six chapters.

== Chapters&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ==
# Law as behavior rule: he shows three theories that lead, according to him, to a unique, non-paradoxical concept system: ''regulational'', ''intersubjective'' and ''institutional''.
# Discusses the two main schools of legal theory: [[legal positivism]] and theories of [[natural law]].
# Approaches the norm in its formal aspect, analyzing ''propositions'', ''prescriptions'', ''expressions'', ''imperatives'', ''commands'' and ''advices''.
# Discusses imperatives specifically, as well as their relationship with [[value judgement]]s, ''permissions'' and the addressees of a norm.
# ''Sanctions'' of norms (prescribed consequences of their violation); the necessity of sanctions to characterize a norm.
# Classifications of norms and the ''[[sine qua non]]'' character of ''[[generalization]]-[[abstraction]]''.

== Criticism ==
"In this book, Bobbio defends a ''positive'' philosophy committed to the scientific soul and against [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] points of view. Bobbio breaks from jusnaturalists tendencies, considering law as a speech to be submitted to the [[language]] analysis, inside the borderlines of a scientific theory, according to the paradigm of the [[logical positivism]]"&lt;ref name="SHV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.shvoong.com/law-and-politics/1708639-teoria-da-norma-jur%C3%ADdica/|title=Teoria da Norma Jurídica|date=19 November 2007|publisher=Shvoong - A Fonte Global de Resumos e Críticas|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bobbio presents his position about ''sanctions''. According to him, sanction is the response to violation of a law. Analyzing sanction under the point of view of efficacy, the relation between law and force appears. For [[Kelsen]], law exists to regulate force. For Bobbio, sanctions are means to obtain the ''desirable human behavior''. Bobbio emphasizes the positive sanctions (awards) in opposition to repressive ones."&lt;ref name="CIEH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciashumanas.com.br/resumo_artigo_7097/artigo_sobre_o_pensamento_jur%C3%8Ddico_de_norberto_bobbio|title=O Pensamento Jurídico de Norberto Bobbio|publisher=Ciências Humanas.coml.br|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this book, Bobbio analyzes the ''law as rule of behavior'', showing a general view  and a criticism of the various theories that intend to reveal the concept of law, concluding that, although all the theories are integrated,  the normativist one prevails in sense of constituting pressuposed of validity for the other ones"&lt;ref name="UNIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uninove.br/ojs/index.php/prisma/article/viewFile/513/492|title=Bobbio, Norberto.

Examples of violations of law include:
* [[Moving violation]], any violation of law committed by a driver while the vehicle is in motion
* [[Parking violation]], parking a motor vehicle in a restricted place or an unauthorized manner
* [[Willful violation]], in U.S. law an act with intentional disregard for a regulation, statute and policy
* [[Infraction]], in United States law, minor or petty offenses that do not require jury trial
* [[Infringement (disambiguation)|Infringement]], various violations of laws or rights, usually used in the context of intellectual property

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="90678">[[File:U.S. Vote for President as Population Share.png|thumb|300px|U.S. presidential election popular vote totals as a percentage of the total U.S. population. Note the surge in 1828 ([[Jacksonian democracy|extension of suffrage to non-property-owning white men]]), the drop from 1890–1910 (when Southern states [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites]]), and another surge in 1920 ([[Women's suffrage in the United States|extension of suffrage to women]]).]]

The issue of '''voting rights in the United States''', specifically the [[Suffrage|enfranchisement and disenfranchisement]] of different groups, has been contested throughout [[History of the United States|United States history]].

Eligibility to vote in the United States is established both through the [[United States Constitution|federal constitution]] and by state law. Several constitutional amendments (the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th]], and [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th]] specifically) require that voting rights cannot be abridged on account of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, or age for those above 18; the constitution as originally written did not establish any such rights during 1787–1870. In the absence of a specific federal law or constitutional provision, each state is given considerable discretion to establish qualifications for suffrage and candidacy within its own respective jurisdiction; in addition, states and lower level jurisdictions establish election systems, such as [[at-large]] or [[single member district]] elections for county councils or school boards.

Beyond qualifications for suffrage, rules and regulations concerning voting (such as the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]) have been contested since the advent of [[Jim Crow laws]] and related provisions that indirectly disenfranchised racial minorities. Since the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment to the Constitution]], and related laws, voting rights have been legally considered an issue related to election systems. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Reynolds v. Sims|ruled in 1964]] that both houses of all state legislatures had to be based on election districts that were relatively equal in population size, under the "[[one man, one vote]]" principle. In 1972, the Court ruled that state legislatures had to redistrict every ten years based on census results; at that point, many had not redistricted for decades, often leading to a rural bias.

In other cases{{Which|date=June 2016}}, particularly for county or municipal elections, [[at-large]] voting has been repeatedly challenged when found to dilute the voting power of significant minorities in violation of the Voting Rights Act. In the early 20th century, numerous cities established small commission forms of government in the belief that "better government" could result from the suppression of ward politics. Commissioners were elected by the majority of voters, excluding candidates who could not afford large campaigns or who appealed to a minority. Generally the solution to such violations has been to adopt [[single-member districts]] (SMDs) but alternative election systems, such as [[limited voting]] or [[cumulative voting]], have also been used since the late 20th century to correct for dilution of voting power and enable minorities to elect candidates of their choice.

The [[District of Columbia]] and 5 major [[territories of the United States]] have [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|one non-voting member]] each (in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]) and no representation in the [[U.S. Senate]].

== Background ==
The [[United States Constitution]] did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only [[White American|white]] male adult property owners to vote.&lt;ref name=NatArchives&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Voting Rights|url=http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voting.html|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Voting in Early America|journal=Colonial Williamsburg|volume=Spring 2007|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freed slaves could vote in four states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-90499-1|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were largely prohibited from voting, as were men without property. Women could vote in [[New Jersey]] until 1807 (provided they could meet the property requirement) and in some local jurisdictions in other northern states. Non-white Americans could also vote in these jurisdictions, provided they could meet the property requirement. By 1856, white men were allowed to vote in all states regardless of property ownership, although requirements for paying tax remained in five states.&lt;ref name=NBER2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stanley L.

Four of the fifteen post-Civil War constitutional amendments were ratified to extend voting rights to different groups of citizens. These extensions state that voting rights cannot be denied or abridged based on the following:
* "Race, color, or previous condition of servitude" ([[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]], 1870)
* "On account of sex" ([[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]], 1920)
* "By reason of failure to pay any [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other tax" for federal elections ([[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]], 1964)&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For state elections: ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'', {{ussc|383|663}} (1966))&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of age" ([[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]], 1971)

Following the [[Reconstruction Era]] until the culmination of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Jim Crow laws]] such as [[literacy test]]s, [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], and religious tests were some of the state and local laws used in various parts of the United States to deny immigrants (including legal ones and newly [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|naturalized]] citizens), non-white citizens, Native Americans, and any other locally "undesirable" groups from exercising voting rights granted under the constitution.&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congressbase.com/40/voting-guide-how-to-cast-your-vote-participate-in-government-and-have-your-voice-heard/|title=Voting Guide: How To Cast Your Vote, Participate In Government And Have Your Voice Heard|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Congress Base|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022120322/http://congressbase.com/40/voting%2Dguide%2Dhow%2Dto%2Dcast%2Dyour%2Dvote%2Dparticipate%2Din%2Dgovernment%2Dand%2Dhave%2Dyour%2Dvoice%2Dheard/|archive-date=2013-10-22|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of such state and local discriminatory practices, over time, the federal role in elections has increased, through amendments to the Constitution and enacted legislation. These reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries extended the franchise to non-whites, those who do not own property, women, and those 18–21 years old.

Since the "right to vote" is not explicitly stated in the U.S. Constitution except in the above referenced amendments, and only in reference to the fact that the franchise cannot be denied or abridged based solely on the aforementioned qualifications, the "right to vote" is perhaps better understood, in layman's terms, as only prohibiting certain forms of legal discrimination in establishing qualifications for suffrage. States may deny the "right to vote" for other reasons. For example, many states require eligible citizens to register to vote a set number of days prior to the election in order to vote. More controversial restrictions include those laws that [[felony disenfranchisement|prohibit convicted felons from voting]], even those who have served their sentences. Another example, seen in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', are disputes as to what rules should apply in counting or recounting ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A state may choose to fill an office by means other than an election. For example, upon death or resignation of a legislator, the state may allow the affiliated political party to choose a replacement to hold office until the next scheduled election. Such an appointment is often affirmed by the governor.&lt;ref name="justia voter" /&gt;

The Constitution, in Article VI, clause (paragraph) 3, does state that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States".

[[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era]] began soon after. Southern states suppressed the voting rights of black and poor white voters through [[Jim Crow Laws]]. During this period, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities; only later in the 20th century were these laws ruled unconstitutional.

=== Native American people ===
From 1778 to 1871, the government tried to resolve its relationship with the various native tribes by negotiating treaties. These treaties formed agreements between two sovereign nations, stating that Native American people were citizens of their tribe, living within the boundaries of the United States. The treaties were negotiated by the executive branch and ratified by the U.S. Senate. It said that native tribes would give up their rights to hunt and live on huge parcels of land that they had inhabited in exchange for trade goods, yearly cash [[Life annuity|annuity]] payments, and assurances that no further demands would be made on them. Most often, part of the land would be "reserved" exclusively for the tribe's use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nur|first=Alio|title=A Long History of Treaties|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=Native American Citizenship|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1800s, many native tribes gradually lost claim to the lands they had inhabited for centuries through the federal government's [[Indian Removal]] policy to relocate tribes from the Southeast and Northwest to west of the [[Mississippi River]]. European-American settlers continued to encroach on western lands. Only in 1879, in the [[Standing Bear]] trial, were American Indians recognized as persons in the eyes of the United States government. Judge [[Elmer Scipio Dundy]] of [[Nebraska]] declared that Indians were people within the meaning of the laws, and they had the rights associated with a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. However, Judge Dundy left unsettled the question as to whether Native Americans were guaranteed US citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alio|first=Nur|title=Native American Citizenship|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=nebraska studies.org|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Native Americans were born within the national boundaries of the United States, those on reservations were considered citizens of their own tribes, rather than of the United States. They were denied the right to vote because they were not considered citizens by law and were thus ineligible. Many Native Americans were told that they would become citizens if they gave up their tribal affiliations in 1887 under the [[Dawes Act]], which allocated communal lands to individual households and was intended to aid in the assimilation of Native Americans into majority culture. This still did not guarantee their right to vote. In 1924, the remaining Native Americans, estimated at about one-third, became United States citizens through the [[Indian Citizenship Act]]. Many western states, however, continued to restrict Native American ability to vote through property requirements, economic pressures, hiding the polls, and condoning of physical violence against those who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alio|first=NUr|title=Native American Citizenship|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=nebraska studies.org|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 20th century, they have been protected under provisions of the Voting Rights Act as a racial minority, and in some areas, language minority, gaining election materials in their native languages.

With the growth in the number of [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]] in Virginia before the Revolution, who challenged the established Anglican Church, the issues of [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious freedom]] became important to rising leaders such as [[James Madison]]. As a young lawyer, he defended Baptist preachers who were not licensed by (and were opposed by) the established state [[Anglican Church in America|Anglican Church]]. He carried developing ideas about religious freedom to be incorporated into the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|constitutional convention of the United States]].

In 1787, [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] stated that "the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature".

Several states granted suffrage to [[free people of color|free men of color]] after the Revolution, including North Carolina. This fact was noted by [[Benjamin Robbins Curtis|Justice Benjamin Robbins Curtis']] dissent in ''[[Dred Scott v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of this there can be no doubt. At the time of the ratification of the Articles of Confederation, all free native-born inhabitants of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina, though descended from African slaves, were not only citizens of those States, but such of them as had the other necessary qualifications possessed the franchise of electors, on equal terms with other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Benjamin Robbins (Justice)|title=''Dred Scott v.

* In the 1820s, New York State enlarged its franchise to white men by dropping the property qualification, but maintained it for free blacks.
* The Supreme Court of North Carolina had upheld the ability of free African Americans to vote in that state. In 1835, because of fears of the role of free blacks after [[Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion]] of 1831, they were disenfranchised by decision of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention. At the same time, convention delegates relaxed religious and property qualifications for whites, thus expanding the franchise for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

When the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was ratified in 1868 after the Civil War, it granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. In 1869, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited the government from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's "race, color, or previous condition of servitude".

After the war, some southern states passed "Black Codes", state laws to restrict the new freedoms of African Americans. They attempted to control their movement, assembly, working conditions and other civil rights. Some states also prohibited them from voting.&lt;ref name="Alio" /&gt;

The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution, one of three ratified after the [[American Civil War]] to grant freedmen full rights of citizenship, prevented any state from denying the right to vote to any citizen based on race. This was primarily related to protecting the franchise of freedmen, but it also applied to non-white minorities, such as [[History of Mexican Americans in Texas|Mexican Americans in Texas]]. The state governments under [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] adopted new state constitutions or amendments designed to protect the ability of freedmen to vote. The white resistance to black suffrage after the war regularly erupted into violence as white groups tried to protect their power. Particularly in the [[U.S. Southern states|South]], in the aftermath of the Civil War whites made efforts to suppress [[Free negro|freedmen]]'s voting. In the 1860s, secret [[vigilante]] groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) used violence and intimidation to keep freedmen in a controlled role and reestablish white supremacy. But, black freedmen registered and voted in high numbers, and many were elected to local offices through the 1880s.

In the mid-1870s, the insurgencies continued with a rise in more powerful white [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]], such as the [[White League]], originating in [[Louisiana]] in 1874 after a disputed gubernatorial election; and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], originating in [[Mississippi]] in 1875 and developing numerous chapters in North and [[South Carolina]]; as well as other "White Line" rifle clubs. They operated openly, were more organized than the KKK, and directed their efforts at political goals: to disrupt Republican organizing, turn Republicans out of office, and intimidate or kill blacks to suppress black voting. They worked as "the military arm of the Democratic Party".&lt;ref name=rable&gt;{{cite book|last=Rable|first=George C.|title=But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=[[Athens, Georgia|Athens, GA]]|isbn=978-0-8203-3011-2|page=132 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qn37CH-i9IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, estimates were that 150 blacks were killed in North Carolina before the 1876 elections. Economic tactics such as eviction from rental housing or termination of employment were also used to suppress the black vote.  White Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South by the late 1870s, and the federal government withdrew its troops as a result of a national compromise related to the presidency, officially ending Reconstruction.

African Americans were a majority in three southern states following the Civil War, and represented over 40% of the population in four other states. While they did not elect a majority of African Americans to office in any state legislature during Reconstruction, whites still feared and resented the political power exercised by freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel J. Chin &amp; Randy Wagner, [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/crcl/vol43_1/65-126.pdf "The Tyranny of the Minority: Jim Crow and the Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty"], 43 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 65 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  After ousting the Republicans, whites worked to restore white supremacy.

Although elections were often surrounded by violence, blacks continued to vote and gained many local offices in the late 19th century. In the late 19th century, a Populist-Republican coalition in several states gained governorships and some congressional seats in 1894. To prevent such a coalition from forming again and reduce election violence, the Democratic Party, dominant in all southern state legislatures, took action to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites outright.

From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven former Confederate states completed political suppression and exclusion of these groups by ratifying new constitutions or amendments which incorporated provisions to make voter registration more difficult. These included such requirements as payment of [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], complicated record keeping, complicated timing of registration and length of residency in relation to elections, with related record-keeping requirements; [[felony disenfranchisement]] focusing on crimes thought to be committed by African Americans,&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel J. Chin, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=433580&amp;high=%20Gabriel%20CHin "Reconstruction, Felon Disenfranchisement and the Right to Vote: Did the Fifteenth Amendment Repeal Section&amp;nbsp;2 of the Fourteenth?"], 92 ''[[Georgetown Law Journal]]'' 259 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[literacy test]] or comprehension test.

Prospective voters had to prove the ability to read and write the [[English language]] to white voter registrars, who in practice applied subjective requirements. [[African Americans|Blacks]] were often denied the right to vote on this basis. Even well-educated blacks were often told they had "failed" such a test, if in fact, it had been administered.  On the other hand, illiterate [[whites]] were sometimes allowed to vote through a "[[grandfather clause]]," which waived literacy requirements if one's grandfather had been a qualified voter before 1866, or had served as a soldier, or was from a foreign country. As most blacks had grandfathers who were slaves before 1866 and could not have fulfilled any of those conditions, they could not use the grandfather clause exemption. Selective enforcement of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] was frequently also used to disqualify black and poor white voters. As a result of these measures, at the turn of the century voter rolls dropped markedly across the South. Most blacks and many poor whites were excluded from the political system for decades. Unable to vote, they were also excluded from juries or running for any office.

In Alabama, for example, its 1901 constitution restricted the franchise for poor whites as well as blacks. It contained requirements for payment of cumulative [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], completion of [[literacy tests]], and increased residency at state, county and precinct levels, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] tens of thousands of [[Poor White|poor whites]] as well as most blacks. Historian J. Morgan Kousser found, "They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote."&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, more whites than blacks in total had been disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135–136"&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legal challenges to disfranchisement ====
Although African Americans quickly began legal challenges to such provisions in the 19th century, it was years before any were successful before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. [[Booker T. Washington]], better known for his public stance of trying to work within societal constraints of the period at [[Tuskegee University]], secretly helped fund and arrange representation for numerous legal challenges to disfranchisement. He called upon wealthy Northern allies and philanthropists to raise funds for the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Pildes, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon"], ''Constitutional Commentary'' 17 (2000): 13-14, accessed Mar 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court's upholding of [[Mississippi]]'s new constitution, in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898), encouraged other states to follow the Mississippi plan of disfranchisement. African Americans brought other legal challenges, as in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903) and ''Giles v. Teasley'' (1904), but the Supreme Court upheld [[Alabama]] constitutional provisions. In 1915 Oklahoma was the last state to append a [[grandfather clause]] to its literacy requirement due to Supreme Court cases.

From early in the 20th century, the newly established [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) took the lead in organizing or supporting legal challenges to segregation and disfranchisement. Gradually they planned the strategy of which cases to take forward. In ''Guinn v. United States'' (1915), the first case in which the NAACP filed a brief, the Supreme Court struck down the grandfather clause in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Maryland]]. Other states in which it was used had to retract their legislation as well. The challenge was successful.

But, nearly as rapidly as the Supreme Court determined a specific provision was unconstitutional, state legislatures developed new statutes to continue disenfranchisement. For instance, in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court struck down the use of state-sanctioned all-white primaries by the Democratic Party in the South. States developed new restrictions on black voting; Alabama passed a law giving county registrars more authority as to which questions they asked applicants in comprehension or literacy tests. The NAACP continued with steady progress in legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation.

In 1957, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] to implement the Fifteenth Amendment. It established the [[United States Civil Rights Commission]]; among its duties is to investigate voter discrimination.

As late as 1962, programs such as [[Operation Eagle Eye (United States)|Operation Eagle Eye]] in Arizona attempted to stymie minority voting through literacy tests. The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] was ratified in 1964 to prohibit poll taxes as a condition of voter registration and voting in federal elections. Many states continued to use them in state elections as a means of reducing the number of voters.

The [[American Civil Rights Movement]], through such events as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and Freedom Summer in Mississippi, gained passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized federal oversight of voter registration and election practices and other enforcement of voting rights. Congress passed the legislation because it found "case by case litigation was inadequate to combat widespread and persistent discrimination in voting". Activism by African Americans helped secure an expanded and protected franchise that has benefited all Americans, including racial and language minorities.

The bill provided for federal oversight, if necessary, to ensure just voter registration and election procedures. The rate of African-American registration and voting in Southern states climbed dramatically and quickly, but it has taken years of federal oversight to work out the processes and overcome local resistance. In addition, it was not until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'' (1966) that all state poll taxes (for state elections) were officially declared unconstitutional as violating the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment. This removed a burden on the poor.&lt;ref name=Scher2015&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=POzqBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;ots=mOZKa1PBCT&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Politics of Disenfranchisement: Why is it So Hard to Vote in America?|last=Scher|first=Richard K.|date=2015|page=viii-ix|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317455363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHLTS2009&gt;{{Cite paper|date=2009|title=Civil Rights in America: Racial Voting Rights|url=https://www.nps.gov/nhl/learn/themes/CivilRights_VotingRights.pdf|journal=|publisher=A National Historic Landmarks Theme Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal challenges have continued under the Voting Rights Act, primarily in areas of redistricting and election systems, for instance, challenging [[at-large]] election systems that effectively reduce the ability of minority groups to elect candidates of their choice. Such challenges have particularly occurred at the county and municipal level, including for school boards, where exclusion of minority groups and candidates at such levels has been persistent in some areas of the country. This reduces the ability of women and minorities to participate in the political system and gain entry-level experience.

=== Women ===
{{See also|History of women's suffrage in the United States}}
A parallel, yet separate, movement was that for [[women's suffrage]]. Leaders of the suffrage movement included [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Alice Paul]]. In some ways this, too, could be said to have grown out of the [[American Civil War]], as women had been strong leaders of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement.  Middle- and upper-class women generally became more politically active in the northern tier during and after the war.

In 1848, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, was held in [[Seneca Falls, New York]]. Of the 300 present, 68 women and 32 men signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] which defined the women's rights movement. The first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] took place in 1850 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], attracting more than 1,000 participants. This national convention was held yearly through 1860.

When Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton formed the National Women Suffrage Association, their goal was to help women gain voting rights through reliance on the Constitution. Also, in 1869 [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]] formed the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA). However, AWSA focused on gaining voting rights for women through the amendment process. Although these two organization were fighting for the same cause, it was not until 1890 that they merged to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). After the merger of the two organizations, the (NAWSA) waged a state-by-state campaign to obtain voting rights for women.

[[Wyoming]] was the first state in which women were able to vote, although it was a condition of the transition to statehood. [[Utah]] was the second territory to allow women to vote, but the federal [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] of 1887 repealed woman's suffrage in Utah. Colorado was the first established state to allow women to vote on the same basis as men. Some other states also extended the franchise to women before the Constitution was amended to this purpose.

During the 1910s Alice Paul, assisted by [[Lucy Burns]] and many others, organized such events and organizations as the [[1913 Women's Suffrage Parade]], the [[National Woman's Party]], and the [[Silent Sentinels]]. At the culmination of the suffragists' requests and protests, ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] gave women the right to vote in time to participate in the [[President of the United States|Presidential]] election of [[US Presidential election, 1920|1920]].

Another political movement that was largely driven by women in the same era was the anti-[[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] [[Temperance movement]], which led to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and [[Prohibition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=women|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline1.html|publisher=Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Washington, D.C. ===
[[Washington, D.C.]], was created from a portion of the states of Maryland and Virginia in 1801. The Virginia portion was [[Cession|retroceded]] (returned) to Virginia upon request of the residents, by an Act of Congress in 1846 to protect slavery, and restore state and federal voting rights in that portion of Virginia.  When Maryland delegated a portion of its land to Congress so that it could be used as the Nation's capital, Congress did not continue Maryland Voting Laws. It canceled all state and federal elections starting with 1802.  Local elections limped on in some neighborhoods, until 1871, when local elections were also forbidden by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Congress is the National Legislature. Under Article&amp;nbsp;I, Section&amp;nbsp;8, Clause 17, Congress has the sole authority to exercise "Exclusive Legislature in all cases whatsoever" over the nation's capital and over federal military bases.  Active disfranchisement is typically a States Rights Legislative issue, where the removal of voting rights is permitted. At the national level, the federal government typically ignored voting rights issues, or affirmed that they were extended.

Congress, when exercising "exclusive legislation" over U.S. Military Bases in the United States, and Washington, D.C., viewed its power as strong enough to remove all voting rights. All state and federal elections were canceled by Congress in D.C. and all of Maryland's voting Rights laws no longer applied to D.C. when Maryland gave up that land. Congress did not pass laws to establish local voting processes in the District of Columbia. This omission of law strategy to disfranchise is contained in the Congressional debates in Annals of Congress in 1800 and 1801.

In 1986, the US Congress voted to restore voting rights on U.S. Military bases for all state and federal elections.

D.C., citizens were granted the right to vote in Presidential elections in 1961, after the ratification of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|twenty-third amendment]]. Amendment 23 is the only known limit to U.S. Congressional powers, forcing Congress to enforce Amendments 14, 15, 19, 24, and 26 for the first time in Presidential elections. The Maryland citizens and territory converted in Washington, D.C., in 1801 were represented in 1801 by U.S. Rep. [[John Chew Thomas]] from Maryland's 2nd, and U.S. Rep. [[William Craik]] from Maryland's 3rd Congressional Districts. These Maryland U.S. Congressional Districts were redrawn and removed from Washington, D.C.

No full Congressional elections have been held since in D.C., a gap continuing since 1801. Congress created a non-voting substitute for a U.S. Congressman, a Delegate, between 1871–1875, but then abolished that post as well. Congress permitted restoration of local elections and [[home rule]] for the District on December 24, 1973. In 1971, Congress still opposed restoring the position of a full U.S. Congressman for Washington, D.C. That year it re-established the position of non-voting Delegate to the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1881791,00.html|title=A Brief History of Washington, D.C.|last=James|first=Randy|date=2009-02-26|newspaper=Time|access-date=2017-02-16|work=|issn=0040-781X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Needs expansion to give Congressional reasoning against representation for the District; might also compare to residents of other national capitals, but most were organic, rather than created separately as was the District--&gt;

[[File:Voting Rights for 17-year-olds in US States.svg|thumb|right|250px|States (shown in blue) allow 17-year-olds to vote in primaries/caucuses if their 18th birthday is before the general election.]]
A third voting rights movement was won in the 1960s to lower the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen. Activists noted that most of the young men who were being [[conscription|drafted]] to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] were too young to have any voice in the selection of the leaders who were sending them to fight. Some states had already lowered the voting age: notably [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Hawaii]], had already permitted voting by persons younger than twenty-one.

The [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]], ratified in 1971, prohibits federal and state laws which set a minimum voting age higher than 18 years. As of 2008, no state has opted for an earlier age, although some state governments have discussed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/04/08/loc_votingage09.html|title=Should voting age fall to 16?

=== Prisoners ===
{{See also|Felony disenfranchisement}}
Prisoner voting rights are defined by individual states, and the laws are different from state to state. Some states allow only individuals on probation to vote. Others allow individuals on parole and probation. As of 2012, only Florida, Kentucky and Virginia continue to impose a lifelong denial of the right to vote to all citizens with a [[felony]] record, absent a restoration of rights granted by the [[Governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States|publisher=The Sentencing Project|date=March 2011|url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119133453/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Kentucky, a felon's rights can be restored after the completion of a restoration process to regain civil rights.&lt;ref name="SP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/|title=Should Felons Be Allowed to Vote After They Have Served Their Time?|first=Michael|last=Gonchar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Florida]] legislature restored voting rights to convicted felons who had served their sentences. In March 2011, however, Governor [[Rick Scott]] reversed the 2007 reforms. He signed legislation that permanently disenfranchises citizens with past felony convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 "State toughens policy of restoring rights to freed felons"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020012121/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 |date=2013-10-20 }}, ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'', August 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, Iowa Governor [[Tom Vilsack]] issued an executive order restoring the right to vote for all persons who have completed supervision.&lt;ref name="SP" /&gt;  On October 31, 2005, Iowa's Supreme Court upheld mass reenfranchisement of convicted felons. Nine other states disenfranchise felons for various lengths of time following the completion of their probation or parole.

Other than [[Maine]] and [[Vermont]], all U.S. states prohibit felons from voting while they are in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2008/09/23/groups-push-to-expand-exfelon-voting|title=Groups push to expand ex-felon voting|author=Gramlich, John|publisher=Stateline.org|date=2008-09-23|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico, felons in prison are allowed to vote in elections.

=== Homelessness ===

==== Obstacles homeless citizens face during voter registration ====
In the 1980s homelessness was recognized as an increasing national problem. By the early 21st century, there have been numerous court cases to help protect the voting rights of persons without a fixed address. Low income and homeless citizens face some obstacles in registering to vote. These obstacles include establishing residency, providing a mailing address, and showing proof of identification. A residency requirement varies from state to state. States cannot require citizens to show residency of more than 30 days before Election Day. The states of Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming allow voters to register on Election Day. North Dakota does not require voters to register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barder|title=American Government and Politics Today|year=2011–2012|publisher=Suzanne Jeans|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, homeless persons in all states have the right to register and vote if they satisfy other conditions. In most states, when registering to vote, homeless voters may designate any place of residence, including a street corner, a park, a shelter, or any other location where an individual stays at night. A citizen may only have one residency during registration, but they may switch their registration each time they change locations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/voting-residency-guidelines "Voting Residency Guidelines"], [[Federal Voting Assistance Program]]&lt;/ref&gt; Designating residency is needed to prove that the citizen lives within the district where he or she wishes to vote. Some states also require a mailing address in order to send out the voter ID card, which the individual must show on Election Day. Some states allow individuals to use PO Boxes as mailing addresses; other states allow the address to be that of a local shelter, advocacy organization, outreach center, or anywhere else that accepts mail on behalf of a person registering to vote. States such as Arizona and Nebraska allow homeless citizens to use county court houses or county clerks' offices as mailing address.

States that do not require a mailing address include Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Montana, New Jersey, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/projects/vote/Manual_2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

All potential voters face new requirements since 2002, when President Bush signed the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx |title=Help America Vote Act of 2002, HAVA &amp;#124; The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) |publisher= Election Assistance Commission |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act |title=Help America Vote Act |publisher=OpenCongress Wiki |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625083933/http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act |archivedate=2013-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires voters to provide their [[Driver's license in the United States|driver's license numbers]], or the last four digits of their [[Social Security Number]] on their voter registration form. This has been enforced.

[[The National Coalition for the Homeless]] (NCH) assists nonprofit organizations, in getting lower income and homeless citizens registered to vote. In 1992, the NCH created a campaign called "You don't need a home to vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/legislative/homeless.html |title="Protect Homeless and their Right to Vote" |access-date=2011-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406111350/http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/legislative/homeless.html |archive-date=2012-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign provided useful resources and guidelines for nonprofit organizations to follow when assisting citizens to register. Nonprofits, like homeless shelters and [[food bank]]s, set up a voter registration party to help homeless citizens to register. The nonprofit workers must remain nonpartisan when assisting in the registration process.

==== Court cases involving homeless voting ====
Voting rights of the American homeless is an issue that has been addressed in the courts since the 1980s. Each  state is responsible for voting regulations in their area; however, many states throughout America have adopted similar laws regarding homeless citizen voting. Disenfranchising the homeless is considered a violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]]. Many arguments have been made against homeless people being able to vote. Their status of true citizenship has been called into question because of their lack of residency. However, the courts have ruled on more than one occasion in favor of the homeless voting.

One of the first court cases regarding homeless voting was ''Pitts v. Black'' (1984) in the US District Court of Southern New York, which ruled that disenfranchising homeless citizens is a direct violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case involved the New York Election Board and homeless individuals assisted by the [[Coalition for the Homeless]], among others. The Election Board denied the individuals the right to vote because they resided on the street or in shelters. The Election Board contended that residency required some claim (such as rent) or ownership of the area on which they resided.&lt;ref name="members.fortunecity.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Marthaann E. Pitts, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Robert S. Black, et al.'', Defendants  No. 84 Civ. 5270 (MJL)|url=http://members.fortunecity.com/legalstuff/608FSupp696.htm|work=court case|publisher=United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|accessdate=4 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218040609/http://members.fortunecity.com/legalstuff/608FSupp696.htm|archivedate=18 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the court decision was made, the Election Board relented slightly and allowed those living in shelters the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Other Coalition for the Homeless Legal Victories|url=http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/pages/other-coalition-for-the-homeless-legal-victories|publisher=Coalition for the Homeless|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Court defined the meaning of "residence" as any fixed location which the individual intends to inhabit regularly. This ruling encompassed all homeless, including those residing on streets and in parks.&lt;ref name="members.fortunecity.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalhomeless.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Decisions on Homeless People's Voting Rights|url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/projects/vote/court.html|publisher=National Coalition for the Homeless|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two California court rulings, ''Collier v. Menzel'', and ''Walters v. Weed'', also addressed the residency question of homeless voters:
* ''Collier v. Menzel'' (1985): The Santa Barbara District Court case established that a residence could be a certain location rather than a specific address. Howard Menzel, the county clerk, rejected three voter registration applications on the grounds that proper addresses were not provided. The applications simply stated a public park as the applicants' residence. The court overruled the clerk's decision and defined a residence as any fixed location where a person habitually sleeps and where living quarters are set up. In their final decisions, the court stated that denying a citizen the right to vote due to residence in a public park, is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause.&lt;ref name="nationalhomeless.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Collier v. Menzel'', 176 Cal.

* ''Walters v. Weed'' (1988): In 1988, the [[California Supreme Court]] judged a case concerning voter precincts of those who are between residences. The court ruled that when a person leaves his former place of residence and has not yet settled in another permanent living place, then the individual may vote in the precinct of his former residence.&lt;ref name="nationalhomeless.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Walters v.

==== Special interest elections ====
Several locales retained restrictions for specialized local elections, such as for school boards, [[Special district (United States)|special districts]], or bond issues. Property restrictions, duration of residency restrictions, and, for school boards, restrictions of the franchise to voters with children, remained in force. In a series of rulings from 1969 to 1973, the Court ruled that the franchise could be restricted in some cases to those "primarily interested" or "primarily affected" by the outcome of a specialized election, but not in the case of school boards or bond issues, which affected taxation to be paid by all residents.&lt;ref name="justia voter"&gt;{{Citation

James'' {{ussc|451|335|1981}}, the Court further upheld a system of [[plural voting]], by which votes for the board of directors of a [[water reclamation]] district were allocated on the basis of a person's proportion of land owned in the district.&lt;ref name="justia voter" /&gt;

The Court has overseen operation of political party primaries to ensure open voting. While states were permitted to require voters to register for a political party 30 days before an election, or to require them to vote in only one party primary, the state could not prevent a voter from voting in a party primary if the voter has voted in another party's primary in the last 23 months.&lt;ref name="justia voter" /&gt;  The Court also ruled that a state may not mandate a "closed primary" system and bar independents from voting in a party's primary against the wishes of the party.

The [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] of the state of [[Hawaii]], created in 1978, limited voting eligibility and candidate eligibility to [[native Hawaiians]] on whose behalf it manages {{convert|1800000|acre|km2}} of ceded land. The Supreme Court of the United States struck down the franchise restriction under the Fifteenth Amendment in ''[[Rice v. Cayetano]]'' {{ussc|528|495|2000}}, following by eliminating the candidate restriction in ''Arakaki v. State of Hawai'i'' a few months later.

== Current status by region ==

=== District of Columbia ===
{{Main|District of Columbia voting rights}}
Citizens of the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]], have not been apportioned a representative or US senator in Congress. This is because D.C. is a federal district and not a state and under the Constitution, only states are apportioned congresspersons.

District of Columbia citizens had voting rights removed in 1801 by Congress, when Maryland delegated that portion of its land to Congress. Congress incrementally removed effective local control or [[home rule]] by 1871. It restored some home rule in 1971, but maintained the authority to override any local laws. Washington, D.C., does not have full representation in the U.S. House or Senate. The  [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]], restoring U.S. Presidential Election after a 164-year-gap, is the only known limit to Congressional "exclusive legislature" from Article I-8-17, forcing Congress to enforce for the first time Amendments 14,15,19, 24, and 26. Amendment 23 gave the District of Columbia three [[U.S. Electoral College|electors]] and hence the right to vote for [[President of the United States|President]], but not full U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators. In 1978, Congress proposed a constitutional amendment that would have restored to the District a full seat for representation in the [[United States Congress|Congress]] as well. This amendment failed to receive ratification by sufficient number of states within the seven years required.

{{as of|2013}}, [[District of Columbia voting rights#Proposal during administration of Barack Obama|a bill]] is pending in Congress that would treat the District of Columbia as "a congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives", and permit United States citizens residing in the capital to vote for a member to represent them in the House of Representatives. The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, S. 160, 111th Cong. was passed by the [[U.S. Senate]] on February 26, 2009, by a vote of 61-37.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/26/senate-votes-give-dc-full-house-vote/|title=Senate votes to give D.C. full House vote|last=Warren|first=Timothy|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=2009-02-26}} The Senate roll call is here [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073].&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 1993, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] of the [[Organization of American States]] received a petition from Timothy Cooper on behalf of the Statehood Solidarity Committee (the "Petitioners") against the government of the United States (the "State" or "United States"). The petition indicated that it was presented on behalf of the members of the Statehood Solidarity Committee and all other U.S. citizens resident in the District of Columbia.  The petition alleged that the United States was responsible for violations of Articles&amp;nbsp;II (right to equality before law) and XX (right to vote and to participate in government) of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] in connection with the inability of citizens of the District of Columbia to vote for and elect a representative to the U.S. Congress. On December 29, 2003, The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights having examined the information and arguments provided by the parties on the question of admissibility. Without prejudging the merits of the matter, the Commission decided to admit the present petition in respect of Articles&amp;nbsp;II and XX of the American Declaration. In addition, the Commission concluded that the United States violates the Petitioners' rights under Articles&amp;nbsp;II and XX of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] by denying District of Columbia [[Citizenship in the United States|citizens]] an effective opportunity to participate in their [[United States Congress|federal legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/oas1203w.pdf Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (Organization of American States) REPORT Nº 98/03*] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001020855/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/oas1203w.pdf |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overseas and nonresident citizens ===
U.S. citizens residing overseas who would otherwise have the right to vote are guaranteed the right to vote in federal elections by the [[Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act]] ([[UOCAVA]]) of 1986.&lt;ref name="usdoj.gov" /&gt;  As a practical matter, individual states implement UOCAVA.

A citizen who has never resided in the United States can vote if a parent is eligible to vote in certain states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|publisher=FVAP|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some of these states the citizen can vote in local, state and federal elections, in others in federal elections only.

=== U.S. territories ===

U.S. citizens and non-citizen [[U.S. national|nationals]] who reside in [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], or the [[United States Virgin Islands]] are not allowed to vote in U.S. national and presidential elections, as these [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] belong to the United States but do not have presidential electors. The U.S. Constitution requires a voter to be resident in one of the 50 states or in the District of Columbia to vote in federal elections.  To say that the Constitution does not require extension of federal voting rights to U.S. territories residents does not, however, exclude the possibility that the Constitution may permit their enfranchisement under another source of law. Statehood or a constitutional amendment would allow people in the U.S. territories to vote in federal elections.&lt;ref name=iguartia /&gt;

Like the District of Columbia, territories of the United States do not have [[U.S. senators]] representing them in the senate, and they each have one [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|member of the House of Representatives who is not allowed to vote]].&lt;ref name="Territories_vote"/&gt;

==== Puerto Rico ====
{{Main|Voting rights in Puerto Rico}}
[[Puerto Rico]] is an [[insular area]] — a [[United States]] [[Organized territory|territory]] that is neither a part of one of the fifty [[U.S. state|states]] nor a part of the [[District of Columbia]], the nation's [[federal district]]. Insular areas, such as Puerto Rico, the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[Guam]], are not allowed to choose electors in [[U.S. presidential election]]s or elect voting members to the [[U.S. Congress]].  This grows out of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article&amp;nbsp;II]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which specifically mandate that electors are to be chosen by "the People of the several States". In 1961, the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd amendment]] to the constitution extended the right to choose electors to the District of Columbia.

Any [[U.S. citizen]] who resides in Puerto Rico (whether a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] or not) is effectively disenfranchised at the national level. Although the Republican Party and Democratic Party chapters in Puerto Rico have selected voting delegates to the national nominating conventions participating in U.S. presidential primaries or caucuses, U.S. citizens not residing in one of the 50 states or in the District of Columbia may not vote in federal elections.

Various scholars (including a prominent U.S. judge in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]) conclude that the U.S. national-electoral process is not fully democratic due to U.S. government disenfranchisement of U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Torruella, Juan R. (1985).{{Citation

{{As of|2010}}, under ''Igartúa v. United States'', the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) is judicially considered not to be [[Self-executing rule|self-executing]], and therefore requires further legislative action to put it into effect domestically. Judge [[Kermit Lipez]] wrote in a concurring opinion, however, that the [[en banc]] majority's conclusion that the ICCPR is non-self-executing is ripe for reconsideration in a new en banc proceeding, and that if issues highlighted in a partial dissent by Judge [[Juan R. Torruella]] were to be decided in favor of the plaintiffs, United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico would have a viable claim to equal voting rights .&lt;ref name="iguartia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1545899.html|title=FindLaw's United States First Circuit case and opinions- ''Gregoria Igartúa et al. v. United States of America et al.'' (Igartúa IV)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress has in fact acted in partial compliance with its obligations under the ICCPR when, in 1961, just a few years after the [[United Nations]] first ratified the ICCPR, it amended our fundamental charter to allow the United States citizens who reside in the District of Columbia to vote for the Executive offices. See U.S. Constitutional Amendment XXIII.51. Indeed, a bill is now pending in Congress that would treat the District of Columbia as "a congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives", and permit United States citizens residing in the capitol to vote for members of the House of Representatives. See District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, S.160, 111th Congress (passed by the Senate, February 26, 2009) (2009).52  However, the United States has not taken similar "steps" with regard to the five million United States citizens who reside in the other U.S. territories, of which close to four million are residents of Puerto Rico. This inaction is in clear violation of the United States' obligations under the ICCPR".&lt;ref name=iguartia /&gt;

== Accessibility ==
Federal legislation such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] (NVRA, or "Motor-Voter Act") and the Help America Vote Act of 2001 (HAVA) help to address some of the concerns of disabled and non-English speaking voters in the United States.

Some studies have shown that polling places are inaccessible to disabled voters.&lt;ref name="accessiblesociety.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=People with Disabilities and Voting|url=http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/voting/|publisher=The Center for an Accessible Society|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Election Commission]] reported that, in violation of state and federal laws, more than 20,000 polling places across the nation are inaccessible, depriving people with disabilities of their fundamental right to vote.

In 1999, the Attorney General of the State of New York ran a check of polling places around the state to see if they were accessible to voters with disabilities and found many problems. A study of three upstate counties of New York found fewer than 10 percent of polling places fully compliant with state and federal laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/polling-places-found-inaccessible-disabled|title=Polling Places Found Inaccessible To Disabled|last=|first=|date=1999-11-01|website=New York State Attorney General|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many polling booths are set in church basements or in upstairs meeting halls where there are no ramps or elevators. This means problems not just for people who use [[wheelchair]]s, but for people using canes or walkers too. And in most states people who are blind do not have access to [[Braille]] ballot to vote; they have to bring someone along to vote for them. Studies have shown that people with disabilities are more interested in government and public affairs than most and are more eager to participate in the democratic process.
&lt;ref name="accessiblesociety.org" /&gt; Many election officials urge people with disabilities to vote absentee, however some disabled individuals see this as an inferior form of participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=txshracd2602&amp;resultListType=RELATED_DOCUMENT&amp;contentSegment=9781412927130&amp;isBOBIndex=true&amp;docId=GALE&amp;#124;CX3469300622#1272|title = Encyclopedia of Disability|date = 2006|access-date = |website = |publisher = SAGE Reference|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voter turnout is lower among the disabled. In the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]] 56.8% of people with disabilities reported voting, compared to the 62.5% of eligible citizens without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://smlr.rutgers.edu/disability-and-voting-survey-report-2012-elections|title = Disability and Voting Survey Report 2012 Election|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = Rutgers University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Candidacy requirements ==
Jurisprudence concerning candidacy rights and the rights of citizens to create a political party are less clear than voting rights.  Different courts have reached different conclusions regarding what sort of restrictions, often in terms of [[ballot access]], public debate inclusion, filing fees, and residency requirements, may be imposed.

In ''[[Williams v. Rhodes]]'' (1968), the United States Supreme Court struck down [[Ohio]] ballot access laws on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.  However, it subsequently upheld such laws in several other cases. States can require an independent or minor party candidate to collect signatures as high as five percent of the total votes cast in a particular preceding election before the court will intervene.

The Supreme Court has also upheld a state ban on cross-party endorsements (also known as [[electoral fusion]]) and primary write-in votes.

== Noncitizen voting ==
{{Main|Right of foreigners to vote in the United States}}

More than 40 states or territories, including colonies before the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], have at some time allowed noncitizens who satisfied residential requirements to vote in some or all elections. This in part reflected the strong continuing immigration to the United States. Some cities like [[Chicago]], towns or villages (in Maryland) today allow noncitizen residents to vote in school or local elections.&lt;ref name=raskin1993&gt;{{Citation
