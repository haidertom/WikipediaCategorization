{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2015}}
'''Alexander Rosenberg''' (born 1946) is an American philosopher, and the R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at [[Duke University]]. He is also a novelist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Krakow-Novel-Alex-Rosenberg/dp/1477830812/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436875168&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+girl+from+krakow&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rosenberg attended the [[City College of New York]] where he graduated with a B.A. in 1967. He received his Ph.D. from the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1971. He won the [[Lakatos Award]] in 1993 and was the National [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Romanell Lecturer in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/RosenbergCV.pdf |title=Archived item |accessdate=2013-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002191946/http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/RosenbergCV.pdf |archivedate=October 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg is an [[atheist]], and a [[metaphysical naturalism|metaphysical naturalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/why-i-am-a-naturalist/|title=Why I Am a Naturalist|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/bodies-in-motion-an-exchange/|title=Bodies in Motion: An Exchange|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and scholarship==
Rosenberg's early work focused on the [[philosophy of social science]] and especially the [[philosophy of economics]]. His doctoral dissertation, published as ''Microeconomic Laws'' in 1976, was the first treatment of the nature of economics by a contemporary philosopher of science. Over the period of the next decade he became increasingly skeptical about [[neoclassical economics]] as an empirical theory.

He later shifted to work on issues in the [[philosophy of science]] that are raised by biology. He became especially interested in the relationship between molecular biology and other parts of biology. Rosenberg introduced the concept of [[supervenience]] to the treatment of intertheoretical relations in biology, soon after [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] began to exploit [[R. M. Hare|Richard Hare]]'s notion in the philosophy of psychology. Rosenberg is among the few biologists and fewer philosophers of science who reject the consensus view that combines [[physicalism]] with [[antireductionism]] (see his 2010 on-line debate with [[John Dupré]] at [[Philosophy TV]]).

Rosenberg also coauthored an influential book on [[David Hume]] with [[Tom Beauchamp]], ''[[Hume and the Problem of Causation]]'', arguing that Hume was not a skeptic about induction but an opponent of rationalist theories of inductive inference.

==Critical discussions of Rosenberg’s work==
Rosenberg’s treatment of fitness as a supervenient property, which is an undefined concept in the theory of natural selection, is criticized by Brandon and Beatty.&lt;ref&gt;in “The Propensity Interpretation of 'Fitness'--No Interpretation Is No Substitute,” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 51, No. 2, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; His original development of how the [[supervenience]] of Mendelian concepts blocks traditional derivational reduction was examined critically by [[C. Kenneth Waters]].&lt;ref&gt;in “Rosenberg's rebellion”, ''Biology and Philosophy'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; His later account of reduction in developmental biology was criticized by [[Günter Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;“How Molecular is Molecular Developmental Biology? A Reply to Alex Rosenberg's Reductionism Redux: Computing the Embryo”, ''Biology and Philosophy'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elliott Sober]]'s "Multiple realization arguments against reductionism"&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy of Science'', vol. 66, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; reflects a shift towards Rosenberg's critique of anti-reductionist arguments of [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]]'s and [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]]'s.

Sober has also challenged Rosenberg’s view that the principle of natural selection is the only biological law.&lt;ref&gt;in “Two Outbreaks of Lawlessness in Recent Philosophy of Biology,” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 64, No. 4, 1996 as did [[Kim Sterelny]] and [[Paul E. Griffiths]], ''Sex and Death''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanatory role of the principle of natural selection and the nature of evolutionary probabilities defended by Rosenberg were subject to counter arguments by Brandon&lt;ref&gt;in “The Indeterministic Character of Evolutionary Theory: No "No Hidden Variables Proof" but No Room for Determinism Either” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 63, No. 3 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Denis Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;“The Pomp of Superfluous Causes: The Interpretation of Evolutionary Theory”, ''Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 74, No. 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg's account of the nature of [[genetic drift]] and the role of probability in the theory of natural selection draws on significant parallels between the principle of natural selection and the second law of thermodynamics.

In the philosophy of social science, Rosenberg’s more skeptical views about [[microeconomics]] were challenged first by Wade Hands&lt;ref&gt;in “What Economics Is Not: An Economist's Response to Rosenberg”, ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 51, No. 3 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Daniel Hausman in several books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;including “Economic Methodology in a Nutshell," ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Vol. 3, No. 2 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial crisis of 2008–09 resulted in renewed attention to Rosenberg's skeptical views about [[microeconomics]]. Biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] and historian Joseph Fracchia express skepticism about Rosenberg’s claim that functional explanations in social science require Darwinian underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;“Does Culture Evolve?” ''History and Theory'' 38 (4), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Atheist's Guide to Reality''==
In 2011 Rosenberg published a defense of what he called "[[Scientism]]"—the claim that "the persistent questions" people ask about the nature of reality, the purpose of things, the foundations of value and morality, the way the mind works, the basis of personal identity, and the course of human history, could all be answered by the resources of science. This book was attacked on the front cover of [[The New Republic]] by [[Leon Wieseltier]] as "The worst book of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/washington-diarist/magazine/98566/science-atheism-meaning-life#.|title=Leon Wieseltier: The Answers – The New Republic|author=Leon Wieseltier|work=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wieseltier|Leon Wiseltier]]'s claim, in turn, was critiqued as exaggeration by [[Philip Kitcher]] in [[The New York Times Book Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/alex-rosenbergs-the-atheists-guide-to-reality.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Philip | last=Kitcher | title=Alex Rosenberg's 'The Atheist's Guide to Reality' | date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2013, Rosenberg debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] over the topics discussed in ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symposiachristi.com/debate/ |title=Is Faith in God Reasonable? |website=Symposia Christi |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg has contributed articles to ''[[The New York Times]]'' Op/Ed series [[The Stone (blog)|The Stone]], on naturalism, science and the humanities, and meta-ethics, and the mind's powers to understand itself by introspection that arise from the views he advanced in ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/why-i-am-a-naturalist/|title=Why I Am a Naturalist|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/bodies-in-motion-an-exchange/|title=Bodies in Motion: An Exchange|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/|title=Can Moral Disputes be Resolved|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/opinion/why-you-dont-know-your-own-mind|author=Alexander Rosenberg|publisher=”[[The New York Times]]”|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Girl From Krakow''==
Rosenberg’s 2015 novel, ''The Girl From Krakow'', Lake Union Publishing, is a narrative about a young woman named Rita Feuerstahl from 1935 to 1947, mainly focusing on her struggles to survive in Nazi-occupied Poland and later in Germany, under a false identity. A secondary plot involves her lover’s experiences in France and Spain during its Civil War in the 1930s and then in Moscow during the war. Rosenberg has acknowledged that the novel is based on the wartime experiences of people he knew. He has also admitted the incongruity of writing a narrative, given his attack on the form in ''The Atheist’s Guide to Reality''. He has said that ''The Girl from Krakow'' began as an attempt to put some of the difficult arguments of ''The Atheist’s Guide to Reality'' into a form easier to grasp".&lt;ref&gt;Ognian Georgiev (August 8, 2015). [http://landofbooks.org/2015/08/08/alex-rosenberg-the-girl-from-krakow-is-based-on-people-who-survived-the-war "Alex Rosenberg: ''The Girl from Krakow'' is based on people who survived the war"], ''Land of Books''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Girl From Krakow'' has been translated into Italian, Hungarian, Polish and Hebrew.

==''Autumn in Oxford''==
In 2016 Rosenberg’s second novel, ''Autumn in Oxford'', appeared, also published by Lake Union Publishing. An afterword identifies the large number of real persons—academics, civil rights advocates, military officers, politicians and intelligence agents from the 1940s and '50s who figure in the narrative.

==''How History Gets Things Wrong: The Neuroscience of our Addiction to Stories''==
In 2018 Rosenberg published ’‘How History Gets Things Wrong: The Neuroscience of our Addiction to Stories’‘ This work develops the eliminative materialism of ‘‘The Atheist’s guide to Reality‘‘ applying it to the role ‘the theory of mind’ plays in history and other forms of story telling.  Rosenberg argues that the work of [[Nobel Prize]] winners, [[Eric Kandel]], [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[May-Britt Moser]] along with [[Edvard Moser]] reveals that the ‘‘theory of mind‘‘ employed in every day life and narrative history has no basis in the organization of the brain. Evidence from evolutionary anthropology, child psychology, medical diagnosis and neural imaging reveals it is an innate or almost innate tool that arose in [[Hominini]] evolution to foster collaboration among small numbers of individuals in immediate contact over the near future, but whose predictive weakness beyond this domain reveals its explanatory emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Samira Shackle (October 19, 2018).[https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5371/can-we-learn-from-history"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''amity-enmity complex''' was a term introduced by [[Sir Arthur Keith]]. His work, ''[[A New Theory of Human Evolution]]'' (1948), posited that humans evolved as differing races, tribes, and cultures, exhibiting patriotism, morality, leadership and nationalism. Those who belong are part of the [[in-group]], and tolerated; all others are classed as [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]], and subject to hostility; 'The code of enmity is a necessary part of the machinery of evolution. He who feels generous towards his enemy... has given up his place in the turmoil of evolutionary competition.' [[Conscience]] in humans evolved a duality; to protect and save friends,
and also to hate and fight enemies. &lt;ref&gt; Sir Arthur Keith, A new theory of evolution, Watts and Co, 1948, p 82 &lt;/ref&gt;
Keith's work summarized earlier opinions on human [[tribalism]] by [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref&gt; Darwin, [[Descent of Man]], 1879, chapter 7, On the Races of man &lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Russel Wallace]],&lt;ref&gt; Darwinism, Wallace, 1889, chapter 15 &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert Spencer]].

==Case studies==
{{Unsourced section|date=November 2017}}
# United States; [[racial segregation]]: Keith suggested that racial segregation imposed by [[Jim Crow law]]s was a 'vast experiment' in which ten million coloureds were 'marked off (in 1948) from the rest by a frontier as sharply defined and jealously guarded as the frontiers of a kingdom'.
# [[Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]: White 'dominance' was 'deeply seated in the primitive organization of the Human brain. [[Boer]] and British settlers both agree 'there is an impassable frontier between them and the native races of Africa and Asia'.
# Jews in Europe: 'The Jews maintain a racial frontier (in 1948), such as dominant races surround themselves with; they carry themselves as if racially distinct...the Jewish frontier may be strengthened by the faith which is (sic) the standard of the race.'  Keith alleged that Jews had a 'dual code; conduct towards their fellows is based on amity, that to all outside their circle is based on enmity. The use of the dual code is the mark of an evolving race.'
# The Indian [[caste system]].

==Disruption==
The amity-enmity complex maintains 'tribal spirit' and thus unity, of the community, 'as long as personal contact between its members is possible.' If the community grows beyond this limitation, then disruption, swarming and disintegration occur. Modern mass communication enables communities 'of 100 million' to remain intact.

==Cyclical effect==
Keith expressed regret that this phenomenon, which explains so much, had not become common knowledge:  "[W]e eternally experience the misery... of each new manifestation of the complex, then invent some new 'ism' to categorise this behavior as an evil, dealing with a common behavioural trait piecemeal [instead of] finally grasping and understanding the phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Keith]], ''A New Theory of Human Evolution'', 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

== Modern examples of tribal instinct==
Colleges, sports teams, churches, trades unions, female fashions and political parties enable people to exhibit tribal loyalty within large, mass-communicating nations. 'In politics we have to take sides.' But all these 'petty manifestations' are cast aside in time of war.
[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Lloyd George]] are cited as statesmen who knew how to exploit the tribal spirit for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/3/6/31369/|title=Index of /files/31369|website=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

==In later works==
[[Robert Ardrey]] pointed out that similar behavior can be observed in most primates, especially baboons and chimps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, pp. 85-89.&lt;/ref&gt; "Nationalism as such is no more than a human expression of the animal drive to maintain and defend a territory... the mentality of the single Germanic tribe under Hitler differed in no way from that of early man or late baboon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amity-enmity complex is a serious obstacle to [[world peace]] and [[world government]], and may even lead to [[nuclear holocaust]]:  "How can we get along without war?... if we fail to get along without war, the future will be as lacking in human problems as it will be remarkably lacking in men."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desmond Morris]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', Cape, 1969, chapter one: Tribes and Supertribes; chapter four: Ingroups and Outgroups &lt;/ref&gt; makes a prescriptive point:  "We must try to step outside our groups and look down on human battlefields with the unbiased eye of a hovering Martian."  And he warns that "the truly violent species all appear to have exterminated themselves, a lesson we should not overlook."  The inherited aggression of the amity-enmity rivalry between communities is rationalized under a "persistent cloak of ideology... a matter of ideals, moral principles, social philosophies or religious beliefs....  [O]nly an immense amount of intellectual restraint will save the situation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', Cape, 1969, chap. four.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War Two]], a debate about the place of instinct and learning (the [[nature versus nurture|nature-versus-nurture]] debate) has occurred. According to [[Steven Pinker]], the "bitter lessons of lynchings, world wars, and the Holocaust" have caused "prevailing theories of mind" to be "refashioned to make racism and sexism as untenable as possible. The doctrine of the [[blank slate]] became entrenched in intellectual life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker]], ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', 2002, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker makes the point that "conflicts of interest are inherent to the human condition."  Man is a product of nature, as much as malarial mosquitoes; both "are doing exactly what evolution designed them to do, even if the outcome makes people suffer...  [We] cannot call their behavior pathological...  [T]he belief that violence is an aberration is dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker]], ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', 2002, pp. 313-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3183">In [[Geotechnical engineering]] the term '''asperity''' is mostly used for unevenness (''roughness'') of the surface of a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]], grain, or particle with heights in the range from approximately 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm to many decimetre. Smaller unevenness is normally considered to be a ''material'' property (often denoted by ''material friction'' or ''basic material friction'').&lt;ref name=Patton1966/&gt;

==Dilation==

An often used definition for ''asperities'' in geotechnical engineering:&lt;br /&gt;
Unevenness of a surface are ''asperities'' if these cause dilation if two blocks with in between a discontinuity with matching ''asperities'' on the two opposing surfaces (i.e. a ''fitting discontinuity'') move relative to each other, under low stress levels that do not cause breaking of the ''asperities''.

==Contrast with asperity in materials science==

[[Materials science]] recognizes [[asperity (materials science)|asperities]] ranging from the sub-visual (normally less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm) to the atomic scale.

'''''Building Safer Communities. Risk Governance, Spatial Planning and Responses to Natural Hazards''''' is a 2009 book edited by Urbano Fra Paleo, published by [[IOS Press]].

This textbook examines the central principles of enhanced [[risk governance]], whose implementation might help to mitigate the increasing losses caused by [[natural hazards]]. It promotes the adoption of [[proactive]], preventive approaches in [[public policies]], particularly through [[land use planning]], by influencing on the occupation of hazard-prone areas.
It serves both as a comprehensive introduction to the formulation and implementation at the strategic level of policies that address [[risk]], and as an advancement in the integration of current practices, including [[emergency management]], [[environmental management]], [[community development]] and [[spatial planning]]. 
The authors study and construe solutions that review integrated strategies of the various levels of government considering:
* The central role of [[local government]] in planning for [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]],
* The integration of mitigation with other social, economic and environmental goals,
* The engagement of all [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in mitigation planning,
* The avoidance of disruption of [[Natural environment|environmental]] functions,
* The need of integrating mandates of higher level government with cooperative planning in order to both secure local government participation and make planning [[sustainable]],
* [[Participatory decision-making]] processes need to be improved by differentiating among their types and applications, in order to effectively respond in [[risk management]],
* People [[perception]] of and response to risk must be part of the planning process,
* Processes of human exposure to natural hazards should be fully understood in order to prevent further exposure,
* The [[precautionary principle]] needs to be integrated in risk management, although under comprehensible [[regulation]] in order to promote action,
* Urban risk governance can only be understood within the framework of regional and biophysical systems,
* [[Social impact assessment]] is a tool that helps to better identify the social and [[community]] dimensions of risk,
* Planning should be considered more as a process than as a result, and
* Post-[[disaster]] recovery also provides opportunities for mitigation and community improvement.&lt;ref name=auth&gt;[http://www.iospress.nl/loadtop/load.php?isbn=9781607500469  Building Safer Communities.

[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right|A plot of Lorenz's [[strange attractor]] for values ρ=28, σ = 10, β = 8/3. The butterfly effect or sensitive dependence on initial conditions is the property of a [[dynamical system]] that, starting from any of various arbitrarily close alternative [[initial condition]]s on the attractor, the [[iteration#mathematics|iterated points]] will become arbitrarily spread out from each other.]]

[[File:Double pendulum simultaneous realisations.ogv|thumb|200px|right|Experimental demonstration of the butterfly effect with different recordings of the same double pendulum. In each recording, the pendulum starts with almost the same initial condition. Over time the differences in the dynamics grow from almost unnoticeable to drastic ones.]]

In [[chaos theory]], the '''butterfly effect''' is the sensitive dependence on [[initial condition]]s in which a small change in one state of a [[deterministic]] [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences in a later state.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123841/http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|archivedate=2016-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, coined by [[Edward Lorenz]], is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant [[butterfly]] several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his [[Numerical weather prediction|weather model]] with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:dnf&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Lorenz gave a name to the phenomenon, the idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was earlier recognized by French mathematician and engineer [[Henri Poincaré]] and American mathematician and philosopher [[Norbert Wiener]]. [[Edward Norton Lorenz|Edward Lorenz]]'s work placed the concept of ''instability'' of the earth's [[atmosphere]] onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing [[nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]].&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butterfly effect - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2016-01-02|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102214427/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems.

==History==
In ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] says that "you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole".

[[Chaos theory]] and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"&gt;[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c Some Historical Notes: History of Chaos Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719234031/http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c |date=2006-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steves |first1=Bonnie |last2=Maciejewski | first2=AJ |date=September 2001 |title=The Restless Universe Applications of Gravitational N-Body Dynamics to Planetary Stellar and Galactic Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wa120qRW5wC |location=USA |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0750308222 |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, [[Jacques Hadamard]] noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. [[Pierre Duhem]] discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"/&gt;

The idea that one [[butterfly]] could eventually have a far-reaching [[ripple effect]] on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", a 1952 short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] about time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | title = The Physics of Ray Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder" | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date = 2012-06-15 | accessdate = 2015-09-02 | first = Faye | last = Flam | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130717/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Gleick |title=Chaos: Making a New Science |location= |publisher=Viking |year=1987 |isbn=0-8133-4085-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenz wrote:
{{blockquote|
"At one point I decided to repeat some of the computations in order to examine what was happening in greater detail. I stopped the computer, typed in a line of numbers that it had printed out a while earlier, and set it running again. I went down the hall for a cup of coffee and returned after about an hour, during which time the computer had simulated about two months of weather. The numbers being printed were nothing like the old ones. I immediately suspected a weak vacuum tube or some other computer trouble, which was not uncommon, but before calling for service I decided to see just where the mistake had occurred, knowing that this could speed up the servicing process. Instead of a sudden break, I found that the new values at first repeated the old ones, but soon afterward differed by one and then several units in the last decimal place, and then began to differ in the next to the last place and then in the place before that. In fact, the differences more or less steadily doubled in size every four days or so, until all resemblance with the original output disappeared somewhere in the second month. This was enough to tell me what had happened: the numbers that I had typed in were not the exact original numbers, but were the rounded-off values that had appeared in the original printout. The initial round-off errors were the culprits; they were steadily amplifying until they dominated the solution." (E. N. Lorenz, ''The Essence of Chaos'', U. Washington Press, Seattle (1993), page 134)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaos at fifty|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518003926/http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|archivedate=2016-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called ''Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=3 June 2010|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L|issn=1520-0469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Deterministic+non-periodic+flow&amp;author=E.+N.+Lorenz&amp;publication_year=1963 Google Scholar citation record]&lt;/ref&gt; (the calculations were performed on a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]] computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |title=Part19 |publisher=Cs.ualberta.ca |date=1960-11-22 |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061640/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963" /&gt; Elsewhere he stated:{{quote| text=One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a [[Gull|sea gull]]'s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever. The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz |first=Edward N. |last2= |first2= |date=1963 |title=The Predictability of Hydrodynamic Flow |url=http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Predictability_hydrodynamic_flow_1963.pdf |journal=Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=409–432 |doi= |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010161512/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Predictability_hydrodynamic_flow_1963.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Following suggestions from colleagues, in later speeches and papers Lorenz used the more poetic [[butterfly]]. According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf Lorenz: "Predictability", AAAS 139th meeting, 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612164541/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf |date=2013-06-12 }} Retrieved May 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|title=The Butterfly Effects: Variations on a Meme|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=AP42 ...and everything|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111132249/http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can ''cause'' the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of [[ensemble forecasting]], in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woods|first=Austin|title=Medium-range weather prediction: The European approach; The story of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts |page=118 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=978-0387269283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics | year=2001| volume=9 | pages=357–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Orrell]] argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=Role of the metric in forecast error growth: How chaotic is the weather?|journal=Tellus | year=2002| volume=54A | pages=350–362| doi=10.3402/tellusa.v54i4.12159| bibcode=2002TellA..54..350O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order |page=208 |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0300186611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Wolfram]] also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolfram|first=Stephen |title=A New Kind of Science |page=998 |location= |publisher=Wolfram Media |year=2002 |isbn=978-1579550080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and mathematical definition==
[[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Recurrence]], the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A [[dynamical system]] displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If ''M'' is the [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]] for the map &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt; displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there are y in ''M'', with distance ''d''(. , .) such that &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(x, y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; and such that

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^\tau(x), f^\tau(y)) &gt; \mathrm{e}^{a\tau} \, d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some positive parameter ''a''. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1-x_n) , \quad 0\leq x_0\leq 1,&lt;/math&gt;

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a [[closed-form solution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n}=\sin^{2}(2^{n} \theta \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[initial condition]] parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tfrac{1}{\pi}\sin^{-1}(x_0^{1/2})&lt;/math&gt;. For rational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; maps into a [[periodic point|periodic sequence]]. But [[almost all]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are irrational, and, for irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; folded within the range&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

==In physical systems==

===In weather===

The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of [[weather]]; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |title=Chaos and Climate |publisher=RealClimate |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702105624/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In quantum mechanics===

The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic [[Kepler problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Postmodern Quantum Mechanics |first=E.

Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems.

==In popular culture==
{{main|Butterfly effect in popular culture}}

The journalist Peter Dizikes, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 2008, notes that popular culture likes the idea of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation."&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dizikes |first1=Petyer |title=The meaning of the butterfly |url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |accessdate=8 June 2016 |agency=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=8 June 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418154015/http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |archivedate=18 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cavitation''' is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid, small liquid-free zones ("bubbles" or "voids"), that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of [[pressure]] that cause the formation of cavities in the liquid where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense [[shock wave]].

Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some [[engineering]] contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called "cavitation". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.

Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]]. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.

Since the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].

== Physics ==

Inertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.

Other ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233–252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.

The physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation "bubbles" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.

The vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.

==Hydrodynamic cavitation==
Hydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.

The process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Orifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChe Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641–1648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes. These processes are manifested in different ways, the most common ones and promising for control being bubble cavitation and supercavitation. The first exact classical solution should perhaps be credited to the well- known solution by H. Helmholtz in 1868. The earliest distinguished studies of academic type on the theory of a cavitating flow with free boundaries and supercavitation were published in the book ''Jets, wakes and cavities''&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff, G, Zarantonello. E (1957) Jets, wakes and cavities. New York: Academic Press.  406p.&lt;/ref&gt;  followed by ''Theory of jets of ideal fluid''.&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich, MI (1978) Theory of jets of ideal fluid.  Nauka, Moscow, 536p. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Widely used in these books was the well-developed theory of conformal mappings of functions of a complex variable, allowing one to derive a large number of exact solutions of plane problems. Another venue combining the existing exact solutions with approximated and heuristic models was explored in the work ''Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries''&lt;ref&gt;Logvinovich, GV (1969) Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries. Naukova dumka, Kiev, 215p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  that refined the applied calculation techniques based on the principle of cavity expansion independence, theory of pulsations and stability of elongated axisymmetric cavities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, RT, Daili, JW, Hammit, FG (1970) Cavitation. New York: Mc Graw Hill Book Company.  578p.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels''.&lt;ref&gt;Epshtein, LA (1970) Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels. Sudostroyenie , Leningrad, 208p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

A natural continuation of these studies was recently presented in ''The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows''&lt;ref&gt;Terentiev, A, Kirschner, I, Uhlman, J, (2011) The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows. Backbone Publishing Company, 598pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  – an encyclopedic work encompassing all the best advances in this domain for the last three decades, and blending the classical methods of mathematical research with the modern capabilities of computer technologies. These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P. R. |last2=Kabadi |first2=A. M. |year=2009 |title=A review of applications of cavitation in biochemical engineering/biotechnology |journal=Biochemical Engineering Journal |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=60–72 |doi=10.1016/j.bej.2008.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Chemical engineering===
In industry, cavitation is often used to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenize]], or mix and break down, suspended particles in a [[colloidal]] liquid compound such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).

Cavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].

Use of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. --&gt;

Hydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together. This effect may assist in [[protein folding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/snap.html | website = Sandia National Laboratories | date = 2006-08-02 | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | title = Sandia researchers solve mystery of attractive surfaces }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrasound sometimes is used to increase bone formation, for instance in post-surgical applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physiomontreal.com/Ultrasound.pdf PhysioMontreal Article "Ultrasound".]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultrasound treatments or exposure can create cavitation that potentially may "result in a syndrome involving manifestations of nausea, headache, tinnitus, pain, dizziness, and fatigue.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php Health Canada "Guidelines for the Safe Use of Ultrasound: Part II – Industrial &amp; Commercial Applications – Safety Code 24"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110213842/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php |date=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the sound of [[cracking joints|"cracking" knuckles]] derives from the collapse of cavitation in the synovial fluid within the joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=A|author2=Dowson, D|author3=Wright, V|title='Cracking joints'. A bioengineering study of cavitation in the metacarpophalangeal joint|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|date=July 1971|volume=30|issue=4|pages=348–58|pmid=5557778|doi=10.1136/ard.30.4.348|pmc=1005793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Movements that cause cracking expand the joint space, thus reducing pressure to the point of cavitation. It remains controversial whether this is associated with clinically significant joint injury such as osteoarthritis. Some physicians say that osteoarthritis is caused by cracking knuckles regularly, as this causes wear and tear and may cause the bone to weaken. The implication being that, it is not the "bubbles popping," but rather, the bones rubbing together, that causes osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deweber|first=K|author2=Olszewski, M|author3=Ortolano, R|title=Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM|date=Mar–Apr 2011|volume=24|issue=2|pages=169–74|pmid=21383216|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
In industrial cleaning applications, cavitation has sufficient power to overcome the particle-to-substrate adhesion forces, loosening contaminants. The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input. This method works by generating controlled acoustic cavitation in the cleaning fluid, picking up and carrying contaminant particles away so that they do not reattach to the material being cleaned.

=== Food and beverage ===

==== Eggs ====
Cavitation has been applied to egg pasteurization. A hole-filled rotor produces cavitation bubbles, heating the liquid from within. Equipment surfaces stay cooler than the passing liquid, so eggs don't harden as they did on the hot surfaces of older equipment. The intensity of cavitation can be adjusted, making it possible to tune the process for minimum protein damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/12/11/569467444/how-the-food-industry-uses-cavitation-the-oceans-most-powerful-punch|title=How The Food Industry Uses Cavitation, The Ocean's Most Powerful Punch|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cavitation damage{{anchor|Cavitation erosion}}==
[[Image:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cavitation damage to a [[Francis turbine]].]]

Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buckland H. C. |first2=Baker T. |last2=Orme J. A. C. |first=Masters I. |doi=10.1177/0957650913477093 |year=2013 |title=Cavitation inception and simulation in blade element momentum theory for modelling tidal stream turbines |journal=Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part A: Journal of Power and Energy |volume=227 |issue=4 |pages=479–485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].

Although the collapse of a small cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller's or pump's lifetime.

After a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevices that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumps and propellers===
Major places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.

As an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure around it can become. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.

Cavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:

====Suction cavitation====
[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.

Common causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.

====Discharge cavitation====
Discharge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.

Discharge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.

====Cavitation solutions====
Since all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.

To have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pulp &amp; Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes&lt;/ref&gt;
To overcome cavitation:
Increase suction pressure if possible.
Decrease liquid temperature if possible.
Throttle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.
Vent gases off the pump casing.

===Control valves===

Cavitation can occur in [[control valves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136&lt;/ref&gt;  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.

===Spillways===
When water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.

Experimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between 12 and 15&amp;nbsp;m/s, and, up to flow velocities of 20&amp;nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.&lt;ref name="Volkart_Rutschmann_1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors – A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc.

When some air is present in the water the resulting mixture is compressible and this damps the high pressure caused
by the bubble collapses.&lt;ref name="Peterka_1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peterka, A.J. |title= The Effect of Entrained Air on Cavitation Pitting."

Although these have been installed for some years, the mechanisms of air entrainment at the aerators and the slow movement of the air away from the spillway surface are still challenging.&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989a"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Study of Air Entrainment and Aeration Devices, Journal of Hydraulic Research, IAHR, Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 301–319 (ISSN 0022-1686)  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view.php?pid=UQ:9385 |year=1989 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989b"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Flow downstream of an Aerator.

The spillway aeration device design is based upon a small deflection of the spillway bed (or sidewall) such as a ramp and offset to deflect the high flow velocity flow away from the spillway surface. In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.

===Engines===
Some larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.

It is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.

From about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.

Some hypotheses relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation—namely cavitiation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.

The loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat. Rising magma, filled with dissolved gasses and under immense pressure, encountered a different magma that compressed easily, allowing bubbles to grow and combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/hvo_volcano_watch.html|title=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory|last=Program|first=Volcano Hazards|website=volcanoes.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation, which is well known from the technical practice.

===Vascular plants===
Cavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem exceeds [[atmospheric pressure]]. The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., &amp; Tyree, M.T., 1996. New evidence for large negative xylem pressures and their measurement by the pressure chamber technique. 'Plant Cell Environ.' 19: 427–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine life===
Just as cavitation bubbles form on a fast-spinning boat propeller, they may also form on the tails and fins of aquatic animals. This primarily occurs near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is low.

Cavitation may limit the maximum swimming speed of powerful swimming animals like [[dolphins]] and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brahic | first = Catherine | title = Dolphins swim so fast it hurts   | publisher = New Scientist | date = 2008-03-28 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn13553-dolphins-swim-so-fast-it-hurts.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are painful. Tuna have bony fins without nerve endings and do not feel pain from cavitation. They are slowed down when cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.&lt;ref name="IosilevskiiWeihs2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iosilevskii|first1=G|last2=Weihs|first2=D|title=Speed limits on swimming of fishes and cetaceans|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=20|year=2008|pages=329–338|issn=1742-5689|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1073|pmid=17580289|pmc=2607394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea animals have found ways to use cavitation to their advantage when hunting prey. The [[pistol shrimp]] snaps a specialized claw to create cavitation, which can kill small fish. The [[mantis shrimp]] (of the ''smasher'' variety) uses cavitation as well in order to stun, smash open, or kill the shellfish that it feasts upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patek|first=Sheila|title=Sheila Patek clocks the fastest animals|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sheila_patek_clocks_the_fastest_animals.html|publisher=TED|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coastal erosion===
In the last half-decade, coastal erosion in the form of inertial cavitation has been generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Geomorphology |last=Panizza |first=Mario  |year=1996 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam; New York |isbn=978-0-444-89830-2 |pages=112–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bubbles in an incoming wave are forced into cracks in the cliff being eroded. Varying pressure decompresses some vapor pockets which subsequently implode. The resulting pressure peaks can blast apart fractions of the rock.

'''Clay''' is a finely-grained natural [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[soil]] material that combines one or more [[clay minerals]] with possible traces of [[quartz]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[metal oxide]]s ([[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ,]] [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]] etc.) and [[organic matter]]. Geologic clay [[deposit (geology)|deposits]] are mostly composed of [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate minerals]] containing variable amounts of [[water]] trapped in the mineral structure. Clays are [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] due to particle size and geometry as well as water content, and become hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or [[Pottery#Firing|firing]].&lt;ref name="guggenheim"&gt;{{harvnb|Guggenheim|Martin|1995|pp=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University College London Geology on Campus: Clays"&gt;{{cite web|title=University College London Geology on Campus: Clays |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay |publisher=Earth Sciences department, [[University College London]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127051002/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay|archivedate=27 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Learning Hub"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is clay|url=http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|website=Science Learning Hub|publisher=[[University of Waikato]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103182308/http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|archivedate=3 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soil classification|Depending on the soil's content]] in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red.

Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. [[Silt]]s, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties.  The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. [[Geologist]]s and [[soil scientist]]s usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 [[Micrometre|µm]] (clays being finer than silts), [[sedimentologist]]s often use 4–5 μm, and [[colloid]] [[chemist]]s use 1 μm.&lt;ref name="guggenheim" /&gt; [[Geotechnical engineering|Geotechnical engineers]] distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' [[Atterberg limits]]. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silt particles as being larger.

Mixtures of [[sand]], [[silt]] and less than 40% clay are called [[loam]]. Loam makes good [[soil]] and is used as a building material.

== Formation ==
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|Deforestation for clay extraction in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The picture is of Morro da Covanca, Jacarepaguá.]]
Clay minerals typically form over long periods of time as a result of the gradual chemical [[weathering]] of rocks, usually silicate-bearing, by low concentrations of [[carbonic acid]] and other diluted [[solvents]]. These solvents, usually acidic, migrate through the weathering rock after [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] through upper weathered layers. In addition to the weathering process, some clay minerals are formed through [[hydrothermal]] activity. There are two types of clay deposits: primary and secondary. Primary clays form as residual deposits in soil and remain at the site of formation. Secondary clays are clays that have been transported from their original location by water erosion and [[Deposition (geology)|deposited]] in a new [[sedimentary]] deposit.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/clays/|title=Environmental Characteristics of Clays and Clay Mineral Deposits|work=usgs.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208055734/http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/clays/|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay deposits are typically associated with very low energy [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environments]] such as large lakes and marine basins.

== Grouping ==
Depending on the academic source, there are three or four main groups of clays: [[kaolin]]ite, [[montmorillonite]]-[[smectite]], [[illite]], and [[chlorite group|chlorite]]. Chlorites are not always considered to be a clay, sometimes being classified as a separate group within the [[phyllosilicate]]s. There are approximately 30 different types of "pure" clays in these categories, but most "natural" clay deposits are mixtures of these different types, along with other weathered minerals.

[[Varve]] (or ''varved clay'') is clay with visible annual layers, which are formed by seasonal deposition of those layers and are marked by differences in [[erosion]] and organic content. This type of [[deposition (geology)|deposit]] is common in former [[glacial lake]]s. When fine sediments are delivered into the calm waters of these glacial lake basins away from the shoreline, they settle to the lake bed. The resulting seasonal layering is preserved in an even distribution of clay sediment banding.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt;

[[Quick clay]] is a unique type of [[marine clay]] indigenous to the glaciated terrains of [[Norway]], [[Canada]], [[Northern Ireland]], and [[Sweden]]. It is a highly sensitive clay, prone to [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]], which has been involved in several deadly [[landslide]]s.

Clays exhibit [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] when mixed with water in certain proportions. However, when dry, clay becomes firm and when [[pottery firing|fired]] in a [[kiln]], permanent physical and chemical changes occur. These changes convert the clay into a [[ceramic]] material. Because of these properties, clay is used for making [[pottery]], both utilitarian and decorative, and construction products, such as bricks, wall and floor tiles. Different types of clay, when used with different [[mineral]]s and firing conditions, are used to produce [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]]. [[Prehistoric]] humans discovered the useful properties of clay. Some of the earliest pottery shards recovered are from central [[Honshu]], [[Japan]]. They are associated with the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]] culture and deposits they were recovered from have been [[radiocarbon dating|dated]] to around 14,000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, C. 2005.

Purpose-made clay balls were also used as [[sling (weapon)#Ammunition|sling ammunition]].

Clays [[sintering|sintered]] in fire were the first form of [[ceramic]]. [[Brick]]s, cooking pots, art objects, [[dishware]], [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipes]], and even [[musical instrument]]s such as the [[ocarina]] can all be shaped from clay before being fired. Clay is also used in many industrial processes, such as [[paper]] making, [[cement]] production, and chemical [[filter (chemistry)|filtering]]. Until the late 20th century, [[bentonite]] clay was widely used as a mold binder in the manufacture of [[sand casting]]s.

Clay, being relatively [[permeability (fluid)|impermeable]] to water, is also used where natural seals are needed, such as in the cores of [[dam]]s, or as a barrier in [[landfill]]s against toxic seepage (lining the landfill, preferably in combination with [[geotextile]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Koçkar, Mustafa K.; Akgün, Haluk; Aktürk, Özgür, [http://www2.widener.edu/~sxw0004/abstract34.html ''Preliminary evaluation of a compacted bentonite / sand mixture as a landfill liner material'' (Abstract)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075553/http://www2.widener.edu/~sxw0004/abstract34.html |date=4 December 2008 }}.

Also a primary ingredient in many [[natural building]] techniques, clay is used to create [[adobe]], [[cob (material)|cob]], [[cordwood]], and [[rammed earth]] structures and building elements such as [[wattle and daub]], clay plaster, clay render case, clay floors and clay [[paints]] and [[ceramic building material]]. Clay was used as a [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in brick [[chimneys]] and stone walls where protected from water.

{{Too many quotes|date=May 2015}}
"'''Darwin among the Machines'''" is the name of an article published in ''[[The Press]]'' newspaper on 13 June 1863 in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, which references the work of [[Charles Darwin]] in the title. Written by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] but signed ''[[Cellarius (name)|Cellarius]]'' ([[q.v.]]), the article raised the possibility that [[machines]] were a kind of "mechanical life" undergoing constant [[evolution]], and that eventually machines might supplant humans as the dominant species:
{{quote|We refer to the question: What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be. We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors; we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation; we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating, self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race. In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.
...

Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole lives to the development of mechanical life. The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}

The article ends by urging that, "War to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them. Every machine of every sort should be destroyed by the well-wisher of his species. Let there be no exceptions made, no quarter shown; let us at once go back to the primeval condition of the race."

==''Book of the Machines''==
Butler developed this and subsequent articles into ''The Book of the Machines'', three chapters of ''[[Erewhon]]'', published anonymously in 1872. The Erewhonian society Butler envisioned had long ago undergone a revolution that destroyed most mechanical inventions. The narrator of the story finds a book that details the reasons for this revolution, which he translates for the reader. In &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;
chapter xxiii: the book of the machines&lt;/span&gt;, a number of quotes from this imaginary book discuss the possibility of machine consciousness:
{{quote|"There is no security"--to quote his own words--"against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time.
...

“Either,” he proceeds, “a great deal of action that has been called purely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more elements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto (and in this case germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher machines)—Or (assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time denying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action) the race of man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all. In this case there is no ''à priori'' improbability in the descent of conscious (and more than conscious) machines from those which now exist, except that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a reproductive system in the mechanical kingdom.}}
Later, in &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;chapter xxiv: the machines—continued&lt;/span&gt;, the imaginary book also discusses the notion that machines can "reproduce" like living organisms:
{{quote|“But the machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind. A thimble may be made by machinery, but it was not made by, neither will it ever make, a thimble. Here, again, if we turn to nature we shall find abundance of analogies which will teach us that a reproductive system may be in full force without the thing produced being of the same kind as that which produced it. Very few creatures reproduce after their own kind; they reproduce something which has the potentiality of becoming that which their parents were. Thus the butterfly lays an egg, which egg can become a caterpillar, which caterpillar can become a chrysalis, which chrysalis can become a butterfly; and though I freely grant that the machines cannot be said to have more than the germ of a true reproductive system at present, have we not just seen that they have only recently obtained the germs of a mouth and stomach?  And may not some stride be made in the direction of true reproduction which shall be as great as that which has been recently taken in the direction of true feeding?

“It is possible that the system when developed may be in many cases a vicarious thing. Certain classes of machines may be alone fertile, while the rest discharge other functions in the mechanical system, just as the great majority of ants and bees have nothing to do with the continuation of their species, but get food and store it, without thought of breeding. One cannot expect the parallel to be complete or nearly so; certainly not now, and probably never; but is there not enough analogy existing at the present moment, to make us feel seriously uneasy about the future, and to render it our duty to check the evil while we can still do so?  Machines can within certain limits beget machines of any class, no matter how different to themselves. Every class of machines will probably have its special mechanical breeders, and all the higher ones will owe their existence to a large number of parents and not to two only.

“Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may it not become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand?  For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.}}
This notion of machine "reproduction" anticipates the later notion of [[self-replicating machine]]s, although in &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;chapter xxv: the machines—concluded&lt;/span&gt;, the imaginary book supposes that while there is a danger that humans will become subservient to machines, the machines will still need humans to assist in their reproduction and maintenance:
{{quote|“Herein lies our danger. For many seem inclined to acquiesce in so dishonourable a future. They say that although man should become to the machines what the horse and dog are to us, yet that he will continue to exist, and will probably be better off in a state of domestication under the beneficent rule of the machines than in his present wild condition. We treat our domestic animals with much kindness. We give them whatever we believe to be the best for them; and there can be no doubt that our use of meat has increased their happiness rather than detracted from it. In like manner there is reason to hope that the machines will use us kindly, for their existence will be in a great measure dependent upon ours; they will rule us with a rod of iron, but they will not eat us; they will not only require our services in the reproduction and education of their young, but also in waiting upon them as servants; in gathering food for them, and feeding them; in restoring them to health when they are sick; and in either burying their dead or working up their deceased members into new forms of mechanical existence.}}
The author of the imaginary book goes on to say that while life under [[machine rule]] might be materially comfortable for humans, the thought of the human race being superseded in the future is just as horrifying to him as the thought that his distant ancestors were anything other than fully human (apparently Butler imagines the author to be an [[Anti-evolution]]ist), so he urges that all machines which have been in use for less than 300 years be destroyed to prevent this future from coming to pass:
{{quote|“The power of custom is enormous, and so gradual will be the change, that man's sense of what is due to himself will be at no time rudely shocked; our bondage will steal upon us noiselessly and by imperceptible approaches; nor will there ever be such a clashing of desires between man and the machines as will lead to an encounter between them. Among themselves the machines will war eternally, but they will still require man as the being through whose agency the struggle will be principally conducted. In point of fact there is no occasion for anxiety about the future happiness of man so long as he continues to be in any way profitable to the machines; he may become the inferior race, but he will be infinitely better off than he is now. Is it not then both absurd and unreasonable to be envious of our benefactors?  And should we not be guilty of consummate folly if we were to reject advantages which we cannot obtain otherwise, merely because they involve a greater gain to others than to ourselves?

“With those who can argue in this way I have nothing in common. I shrink with as much horror from believing that my race can ever be superseded or surpassed, as I should do from believing that even at the remotest period my ancestors were other than human beings. Could I believe that ten hundred thousand years ago a single one of my ancestors was another kind of being to myself, I should lose all self-respect, and take no further pleasure or interest in life. I have the same feeling with regard to my descendants, and believe it to be one that will be felt so generally that the country will resolve upon putting an immediate stop to all further mechanical progress, and upon destroying all improvements that have been made for the last three hundred years. I would not urge more than this. We may trust ourselves to deal with those that remain, and though I should prefer to have seen the destruction include another two hundred years, I am aware of the necessity for compromising, and would so far sacrifice my own individual convictions as to be content with three hundred. Less than this will be insufficient.”}}
Erewhonian society came to the conclusion "...that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life. So... they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had not been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years..." (from &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;
chapter ix: to the metropolis&lt;/span&gt;.)

Despite the initial popularity of ''Erewhon'', Butler commented in the preface to the second edition that reviewers had "in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr. Darwin’s theory to an absurdity." He protested that "few things would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin", but also added "I am surprised, however, that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer; neither shall I mention the name of the book here, though I should fancy that the hint given will suffice",&lt;ref&gt;[[Project Gutenberg]] eBook [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1906 ''Erewhon'' by Samuel Butler.]&lt;/ref&gt; which may suggest that the chapter on Machines was in fact a satire intended to illustrate the "specious misuse of analogy", even if the target was not Darwin; Butler, fearing that he had offended Darwin, wrote him a letter explaining that the actual target was [[Joseph Butler]]'s 1736 ''The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature''. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scholar Herbert Sussman has suggested that although Butler's exploration of machine evolution was intended to be whimsical, he may also have been genuinely interested in the notion that living organisms are a type of mechanism and was exploring this notion with his writings on machines,&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383&lt;/ref&gt; while the philosopher Louis Flaccus called it "a mixture of fun, satire, and thoughtful speculation."&lt;ref&gt;Flaccus, Louis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JigdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false University lectures delivered by members of the faculty in the free public lecture course], p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Evolution of Global Intelligence''==
[[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] applies Butler's original [[premise]] to the [[artificial life]] and [[artificial intelligence|intelligence]] of [[Alan Turing]] in '''''Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence''''' (1998) {{ISBN|0-7382-0030-1}}, to suggest that the internet is a living, [[sentient]] [[being]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dyson's main claim is that the evolution of a conscious mind from today's technology is inevitable. It is not clear whether this will be a single mind or multiple minds, how smart that mind would be, and even if we will be able to communicate with it. He also clearly suggests that there are forms of intelligence on Earth that we are currently unable to understand.

From the book: "What mind, if any, will become apprehensive of the great coiling of ideas now under way is not a meaningless question, but it is still too early in the game to expect an answer that is meaningful to us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tal.forum2.org/darwin Excerpted from review] by [http://tal.forum2.org/author_Tal%20Cohen Tal Cohen], 30 September 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
{{See also|debris ball|road debris}}

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)
| year=2003
| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross
| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.icrc.org/IHL.nsf/FULL/610?OpenDocument
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=War Debris Treaty To Come Into Force in November

| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1803977&amp;C=mideast
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

'''Deep time''' is the concept of [[Geologic time scale|geologic time]]. The modern philosophical concept was developed in the 18th century by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] geologist [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797).{{sfn|Palmer|Zen}}{{sfn|Kubicek|2008}} The [[age of the Earth]] has been determined to be, after a long and complex history of developments, around 4.55&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-science-figured-out-the-age-of-the-earth/|title=How Science Figured Out the Age of Earth|last=Braterman|first=Paul S.|website=Scientific American|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific concept==
{{Life timeline}}
Hutton based his view of deep time on a form of geochemistry that had developed in Scotland and Scandinavia from the 1750s onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Eddy |first = Matthew Daniel |title = The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800 |date = 2008 |publisher = [[Ashgate]] |location = London |page = Ch. 5 |url = https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[mathematician]] [[John Playfair]], one of Hutton's friends and colleagues in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], remarked upon seeing the [[stratum|strata]] of the [[Unconformity|angular unconformity]] at [[Siccar Point]] with Hutton and [[Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet|James Hall]] in June 1788, "the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time".{{sfn|Playfair|1805}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McPhee |first= John |date= 1981 |title= Book 1: Basin and Range, in [[Annals of the Former World]] |url= |location= New York |publisher= [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page= 79 |isbn= 0-374-10520-0 |author-link= John McPhee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[geologists]] such as [[Nicolas Steno]] (1638-1686) and [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] (1740-1799) had developed ideas of [[Stratum|geological strata]] forming from water through chemical processes, which [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) developed into a theory known as [[Neptunism]], envisaging the slow crystallisation of minerals in the ancient oceans of the Earth to form [[rock (geology)|rock]].  Hutton's innovative 1785 theory, based on [[Plutonism]], visualised an endless cyclical process of rocks forming under the sea, being uplifted and tilted, then eroded to form new strata under the sea. In 1788 the sight of [[Hutton's Unconformity]] at Siccar Point convinced Playfair and Hall of this extremely slow cycle, and in that same year Hutton memorably wrote "we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end".{{sfn|Montgomery|2003}}{{sfn|Rance|1999}}

Other scientists such as [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769-1832) put forward ideas of past ages, and geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] (1785-1873) incorporated Werner's ideas into concepts of [[catastrophism]]; Sedgwick inspired his university student [[Charles Darwin]] to exclaim "What a capital hand is Sedgewick [sic] for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!".{{sfn|Darwin|1831}}  In a competing theory, [[Charles Lyell]] in his ''Principles of Geology'' (1830–1833) developed Hutton's comprehension of endless deep time as a crucial [[Science|scientific]] concept  into [[uniformitarianism]].  As a young [[Natural history|naturalist]] and geological theorist, Darwin studied the successive volumes of Lyell's book exhaustively during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey voyage]] in the 1830s, before beginning to theorise about [[evolution]].

[[Physicist]] [[Gregory Benford]] addresses the concept in ''Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia'' (1999), as does [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor [[Henry Gee]] in ''In Search of Deep Time:  Beyond the Fossil Record to a New History of Life'' (2001){{sfn|Korthof|2000}}{{sfn|Campbell|2001}}  [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]'' (1987) also deals in large part with the evolution of the concept.

[[John McPhee]] discussed "deep time" at length with the layperson in mind in ''Basin and Range'' (1981), parts of which originally appeared in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}} In ''Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle'', Gould cited one of the metaphors McPhee used in explaining the concept of deep time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider the Earth's history as the old measure of the English yard, the distance from the King's nose to the tip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concepts similar to geologic time were recognized in the 11th century by the [[Islamic geography|Persian geologist]] and [[polymath]] [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina, 973–1037),{{sfn|Toulmin|Goodfield|1965|p=64}} and by the [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese naturalist]] and polymath [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|pp=iii,23-24}}

The [[Roman Catholic]] [[theologian]] [[Thomas Berry]] (1914–2009) explored [[spirituality|spiritual]] implications of the concept of deep time.  Berry proposes that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. This view has greatly influenced the development of [[deep ecology]] and [[ecophilosophy]]. The experiential nature of the experience of deep time has also greatly influenced the work of [[Joanna Macy]] and [[John Seed]].

[[H.G. Wells]] and [[Julian Huxley]] regarded the difficulties of coping with the concept of deep time as exaggerated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of different scales is simply a matter of practice", they said in ''[[The Science of Life]]'' (1929).  "We very soon get used to maps, though they are constructed on scales down to a hundred-millionth of natural size. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; to grasp geological time all that is needed is to stick tight to some magnitude which shall be the unit on the new and magnified scale—a million years is probably the most convenient—to grasp its meaning once and for all by an effort of imagination, and then to think of all passage of geological time in terms of this unit."&lt;ref&gt;
H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: The Literary Guild, 1934; orig. publ. 1929), p. 326.

A '''defensible space''', in the context of [[fire control]], is a natural and/or landscaped area around a structure that has been maintained and designed to reduce fire danger. The practice is sometimes called  '''firescaping'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626085521/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }} SBCFD-Firescaping. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Defensible space" is also used in the context of [[wildfire]]s, especially in the [[wildland-urban interface]] (WUI).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/communications_firesafety_100feet.php CAL-FIRE intro Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt; This defensible space reduces the risk that fire will spread from one area to another, or to a structure, and provides [[firefighter]]s access and a safer area from which to defend a threatened area. Firefighters sometimes do not attempt to protect structures without adequate defensible space, as it is less safe and less likely to succeed.

==Criteria==
*A first concept of defensible space for most fire agencies' primary goal of fuel reduction is a recommended or required defensible space around a structure to extend for at least {{convert|100|ft|m}} in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_requlation.pdf SBCFD-regulation. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*A second concept of defensible space is "fuel reduction." This means plants are selectively thinned and pruned to reduce the combustible fuel mass of the remaining plants. The goal is to break up the more continuous and dense uninterrupted layer of vegetation.
*A third concept of defensible space is "[[fuel ladder]]" management. Like rungs on a ladder, vegetation can be present at varying heights from groundcover to trees. Ground fuel "rungs", such as dried grasses, can transmit fire to shrub rungs, which then transmit up tree branch rungs into the tree canopy. A burning tree produces embers that can blow to new areas, spreading and so making it more difficult to control a wildland fire. One guideline is for a typical separation of three times the height of the lower fuel to the next fuel ladder. For example, a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} shrub under a tree would need a spacing of {{convert|6|ft|m}} to the lowest limbs of the tree. Since wildfires burn faster uphill than on flat land, fuel ladder spacing may need to be greater for slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419051651/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp.html |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }} SBCFD-intro. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape use==
The term defensible space in landscape ("firescape") use refers to the {{convert|100|ft|m}} zone surrounding a structure. Often the location is in the [[wildland–urban interface]]. This area need not be devoid of vegetation by using naturally fire resistive plants that are spaced, pruned and trimmed, and irrigated, to minimize the fuel mass available to ignite and also to hamper the spread of a fire.

#The first {{convert|30|ft|m}} is the "Defensible Space Zone," of a defensible space around a structure. It is where [[vegetation]] is kept to a minimum combustible mass. A guideline used in this zone can be "low, lean and green."
#The second distance of {{convert|30|to|100|ft|m}}, is the "Reduced Fuel Zone" of a defensible space around a structure. In this area of the defensible space, fuels/vegetation are separated vertically and horizontally depending on the vegetation type. This is done by: thinning, pruning, and removal of selected vegetation; and limbing up trees from lower vegetation and the lateral separation of [[canopy (forest)|tree canopies]]. types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_guidelines.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012355/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_guidelines.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }} CAL-FIRE-guidelines. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An important component is ongoing maintenance of the fire-resistant landscaping for reduced fuel loads and fire fighting access. Fire resistive plants that are not maintained can [[Desiccation|desiccate]], die, or amass [[Coarse woody debris|deadwood debris]], and become fire assistive. Irrigation systems and pruning can help maintain a plant's fire resistance. Maintaining access roads and driveways clear of side and low-hanging vegetation can allow large fire equipment to reach properties and structures.
Some agencies recommend clearing combustible vegetation at minimum horizontal 10&amp;nbsp;ft from roads and driveways a vertical of 13&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inches above them. Considering the plant material involved is important to not create unintended consequences to habitat integrity and unnecessary aesthetic issues. Street signs, and homes clearly identified with the numerical address, assist access also.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/homeowners_checklist.pdf  SBCFD Retrieved 4/26/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626085521/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }} SBCFD-checklist. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unintended consequences==
The unintended negative consequences of [[erosion]] and native [[habitat]] loss can result from some unskillful defensible space applications. The disturbance of the soil surface, such as garden [[Tillage|soil cultivation]] in and [[firebreak]]s beyond native landscape zones areas, destroys the native plant cover and exposes open soil, accelerating [[invasive species]] of plants ("invasive exotics") spreading and replacing native [[habitat]]s.&lt;ref name=neutral&gt;{{citation| last=Colautti| first=Robert I.; MacIsaac, Hugh J.| title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal= Diversity and Distributions|year=2004|url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf|format=PDF| volume=10| pages=135–141| accessdate=2007-07-11| doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In suburban and [[wildland–urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in mistaken excessive [[clearcutting]] of native and [[Introduced species|non-invasive introduced]] shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for [[Invasive species|invasive plant species]], and also to erosion and landslides. Negative aesthetic consequences to natural and landscaped areas can be minimized with integrated and balanced defensible space practices.&lt;ref&gt;(September 21, 2006).

'''Dorrite''' is a silicate [[mineral]] that is [[isostructural]] to the [[aenigmatite]] group.&lt;ref name=Cosca/&gt; Although it is most chemically similar to the mineral [[rhönite]] [Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;], the lack of titanium (Ti) and presence of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; influenced dorrite's independence.&lt;ref name=Cosca/&gt; Dorrite is named for Dr. John (Jack) A. Dorr, a late professor at the [[University of Michigan]] that researched in [[outcrops]] where dorrite was found in 1982.&lt;ref name=Dorrite/&gt; This mineral is sub-metallic resembling colors of brownish-black, dark brown, to reddish brown.

==Discovery==
Dorrite was first reported in 1982 by A. Havette in a basalt-limestone [[Contact (geology)|contact]] on Réunion Island off of the coast of Africa.&lt;ref name=Cosca/&gt; The second report of dorrite was made by Franklin Foit and his associates while examining a paralava from the [[Powder River Basin]], Wyoming in 1987. Analyses determined that this newly found mineral was surprisingly similar to the mineral rhönite, lacking Ti but presenting dominant Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in its [[octahedral]] sites.&lt;ref name=Cosca/&gt; Other minerals that coexist with this phase are [[plagioclase]], [[gehlenite]]-[[Åkermanite|akermanite]], [[magnetite]]-magnesioferrite-spinel solid solutions, [[esseneite]], [[nepheline]], [[wollastonite]], Ba-rich [[feldspar]], [[apatite]], [[ulvöspinel]], ferroan [[sahamalite]], and secondary [[barite]], and [[calcite]].&lt;ref name=Cosca/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Dorrite can be found in mineral reactions that relate dorrite + [[magnetite]] + [[clinopyroxene]], rhönite + [[magnetite]] + [[olivine]] + [[clinopyroxene]], and [[aenigmatite]] + [[pyroxene]] + [[olivine]] assemblages in nature.&lt;ref name=Cosca/&gt;  These assemblages favor low pressures and high temperatures.&lt;ref name=Cosca/&gt; Dorrite is stable in strongly [[oxidizing]], high-temperature, low-pressure environments. It occurs in paralava, pyrometamorphic melt rock, formed from the burning of [[coal]] beds.&lt;ref name=Dorrite/&gt;

==Crystallography==
Researchers conclusively determined that dorrite is triclinic-pseudomonoclinic and twinned by a twofold rotation about the pseudomonoclinic b axis. The parameters for dorrite are a=10.505, b=10.897, c=9.019 Å, α=106.26°, β=95.16°, γ=124.75°.&lt;ref name=Dorrite/&gt;

'''Earth radius''' is the distance from a selected center of Earth to a point on its surface,  which is often chosen to be sea level, or more commonly, the surface of an idealized ellipsoid representing the shape of Earth. Because Earth is not a perfect sphere, the determination of Earth's radius can have several values, depending on how it is measured; from its equatorial radius of about {{convert|6378|km|mi|abbr=off}} to its polar radius of about {{convert|6357|km|mi|abbr=off}}. 

When only one radius is stated, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) prefers that it be Earth's equatorial radius.&lt;ref name="IAU XXIX" /&gt;  

The [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) gives three global average radii, the arithmetic mean of the radii of the ellipsoid (R{{sub|1}}), the radius of a sphere with the same surface area as the ellipsoid or authalic radius (R{{sub|2}}), and the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the ellipsoid (R{{sub|3}}).&lt;ref name="Moritz" /&gt; All three IUGG average radii are about {{convert|6371|km|mi}}. A fourth global average radius not mentioned by the IUGG is the rectifying radius, the radius of a sphere with a circumference equal to the perimeter of the polar cross section of the ellipsoid, about {{convert|6367|km|mi}}. The radius of curvature at any point on the surface of the ellipsoid depends on its coordinates and its azimuth, north-south (meridional), east-west (prime vertical), or somewhere in between. 

==Introduction==
[[File:Earth_oblateness_to_scale.svg|thumb|300px|A scale diagram of the [[Flattening|oblateness]] of the 2003 [[IERS]] [[reference ellipsoid]]. The outer edge of the dark blue line is an [[ellipse]] with the same [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] as that of Earth, with north at the top. For comparison, the light blue circle within has a diameter equal to the ellipse's [[minor axis]]. The red line represents the [[Karman line]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]], while the yellow area denotes the [[apsis|altitude]] range of the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in [[low Earth orbit]].]]
{{main|Figure of the Earth|Earth ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid}}

[[Earth's rotation]], internal density variations, and external [[tidal force]]s cause its shape to deviate systematically from a perfect sphere.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For details see [[figure of the Earth]], [[geoid]], and [[Earth tide]].&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[topography]] increases the variance, resulting in a surface of profound complexity. Our descriptions of Earth's surface must be simpler than reality in order to be tractable. Hence, we create models to approximate characteristics of Earth's surface, generally relying on the simplest model that suits the need.

Each of the models in common use involve some notion of the geometric [[radius]]. Strictly speaking, spheres are the only solids to have radii, but broader uses of the term ''radius'' are common in many fields, including those dealing with models of Earth. The following is a partial list of models of Earth's surface, ordered from exact to more approximate:
* The actual surface of Earth
* The [[geoid]], defined by [[mean sea level]] at each point on the real surface&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;There is no single center to the geoid; it varies according to local [[Geodetic system|geodetic]] conditions.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[spheroid]], also called an [[ellipsoid]] of revolution, [[Geodetic system#Geodetic versus geocentric latitude|geocentric]] to model the entire Earth, or else [[Geodetic system#Geodetic versus geocentric latitude|geodetic]] for regional work&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In a geocentric ellipsoid, the center of the ellipsoid coincides with some computed center of Earth, and best models the earth as a whole. Geodetic ellipsoids are better suited to regional idiosyncrasies of the geoid. A partial surface of an ellipsoid gets fitted to the region, in which case the center and orientation of the ellipsoid generally do not coincide with the earth's center of mass or axis of rotation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[sphere]]

In the case of the geoid and ellipsoids, the fixed distance from any point on the model to the specified center is called ''"a radius of the Earth"'' or ''"the radius of the Earth at that point"''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The value of the radius is completely dependent upon the latitude in the case of an ellipsoid model, and nearly so on the geoid.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common to refer to any ''[[#Mean radii|mean radius]]'' of a spherical model as ''"the radius of the earth"''. When considering the Earth's real surface, on the other hand, it is uncommon to refer to a "radius", since there is generally no practical need. Rather, elevation above or below sea level is useful.

Regardless of the model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357&amp;nbsp;km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378&amp;nbsp;km (3,950 to 3,963&amp;nbsp;mi). Hence, the Earth deviates from a perfect sphere by only a third of a percent, which supports the spherical model in many contexts and justifies the term "radius of the Earth". While specific values differ, the concepts in this article generalize to any major [[planet]].

===Physics of Earth's deformation===
Rotation of a planet causes it to approximate an ''[[spheroid|oblate ellipsoid]]/spheroid'' with a bulge at the [[equator]] and flattening at the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s, so that the ''equatorial radius'' {{mvar|a}} is larger than the ''polar radius'' {{mvar|b}} by approximately {{mvar|aq}}. The ''oblateness constant'' {{mvar|q}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{a^3 \omega^2}{GM}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ω}} is the [[angular frequency]], {{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]], and {{mvar|M}} is the mass of the planet.{{refn|This follows from the [[International Astronomical Union]] [[2006 definition of planet|definition]] rule (2): a planet assumes a shape due to [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] where [[gravity]] and [[centrifugal force]]s are nearly balanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107022302/http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html |date=2006-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} For the Earth {{math|{{sfrac|1|''q''}} ≈ 289}}, which is close to the measured inverse [[flattening]] {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}} ≈ 298.257}}. Additionally, the bulge at the equator shows slow variations. The bulge had been decreasing, but since 1998 the bulge has increased, possibly due to redistribution of ocean mass via currents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020801gravityfield.html Satellites Reveal A Mystery Of Large Change In Earth's Gravity Field ], Aug. 1, 2002, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428205036/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020801gravityfield.html |date=April 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lowresgeoidheight.jpg|400px|right]]
The variation in [[density]] and [[Crust (geology)|crustal]] thickness causes gravity to vary across the surface and in time, so that the mean sea level differs from the ellipsoid. This difference is the ''[[geoid]] height'', positive above or outside the ellipsoid, negative below or inside. The geoid height variation is under {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} on Earth. The geoid height can change abruptly due to earthquakes (such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Sumatra-Andaman earthquake]]) or reduction in ice masses (such as [[Greenland]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18567 NASA's Grace Finds Greenland Melting Faster, 'Sees' Sumatra Quake], December 20, 2005, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all deformations originate within the Earth. The gravity of the Moon and Sun cause the Earth's surface at a given point to undulate by tenths of meters over a nearly 12-hour period (see [[Earth tide]]).

===Radius and local conditions===
[[File:Abu Reyhan Biruni-Earth Circumference.svg|thumb|[[Al-Biruni#Geodesy and geography|Al-Biruni]]'s (973–1048) method for calculation of the Earth's radius improved accuracy.]]
Given local and transient influences on surface height, the values defined below are based on a "general purpose" model, refined as globally precisely as possible within {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} of reference ellipsoid height, and to within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of mean sea level (neglecting geoid height).

Additionally, the radius can be estimated from the curvature of the Earth at a point. Like a [[torus]], the curvature at a point will be greatest (tightest) in one direction (north–south on Earth) and smallest (flattest) perpendicularly (east–west). The corresponding [[Radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] depends on the location and direction of measurement from that point. A consequence is that a distance to the [[horizon|true horizon]] at the equator is slightly shorter in the north/south direction than in the east-west direction.

In summary, local variations in terrain prevent defining a single "precise" radius. One can only adopt an idealized model. Since the estimate by [[Eratosthenes]], many models have been created. Historically, these models were based on regional topography, giving the best [[Figure of the Earth#Historical Earth ellipsoids|reference ellipsoid]] for the area under survey. As satellite remote sensing and especially the [[Global Positioning System]] gained importance, true global models were developed which, while not as accurate for regional work, best approximate the Earth as a whole.

==Fixed radius==
The following radii are fixed and do not include a variable location dependence. They are derived from the [[World Geodetic System]] 1984 ([[WGS-84]]) standard ellipsoid.&lt;ref name=tr8350_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf |title=WGS84RPT.tif:Corel PHOTO-PAINT |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value for the equatorial radius is defined to the nearest 0.1&amp;nbsp;m in WGS-84. The value for the polar radius in this section has been rounded to the nearest 0.1&amp;nbsp;m, which is expected to be adequate for most uses. Refer to the WGS-84 ellipsoid if a more precise value for its polar radius is needed.

The radii in this section are for an idealized surface. Even the idealized radii have an uncertainty of ±2&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350.2-a/Chapter%203.pdf |title=Info |website=earth-info.nga.mil |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy between the ellipsoid radius and the radius to a physical location may be significant. When identifying the position of an observable location, the use of more precise values for WGS-84 radii may not yield a corresponding improvement in [[accuracy]].

The symbol given for the named radius is used in the formulae found in this article.

===Equatorial radius===
The Earth's equatorial radius {{mvar|a}}, or [[semi-major axis]], is the distance from its center to the [[equator]] and equals {{convert|6378.1370|km|mi|sigfig=8|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html#EarthRadius2009|title=Equatorial Radius of the Earth|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy: Astronomical Constants : Current Best Estimates (CBEs)|publisher=IAU Division I Working Group|access-date=2016-08-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equatorial radius is often used to compare Earth with other [[Planet#Attributes|planets]].

===Polar radius===
The Earth's polar radius {{mvar|b}}, or [[semi-minor axis]], is the distance from its center to the North and South Poles, and equals {{convert|6356.7523|km|mi|sigfig=8|abbr=on}}.

==Location-dependent radii{{anchor|Radii with location dependence}}==

===Geocentric radius===
The distance from the Earth's center to a point on the spheroid surface at geodetic latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;R(\varphi)=\sqrt{\frac{(a^2\cos\varphi)^2+(b^2\sin\varphi)^2}{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are, respectively, the equatorial radius and the polar radius.

===Radii of curvature{{anchor|Curvature}}===
{{see also|Spheroid#Curvature}}

====Principal sections====
There are two [[Principal curvature|principal radii of curvature]]: along the meridional and prime-vertical [[normal section]]s.

=====Meridional=====
In particular, the Earth's ''radius of curvature in the (north–south) [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]'' at {{mvar|φ}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;M(\varphi)=\frac{(ab)^2}{\big((a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2\big)^\frac32}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the radius that [[Eratosthenes#Measurement of the Earth|Eratosthenes]] measured.

=====Prime vertical=====
If one point had appeared due east of the other, one finds the approximate curvature in the east–west direction.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=curvprim&gt;East–west directions can be misleading. Point B, which appears due east from A, will be closer to the equator than A. Thus the curvature found this way is smaller than the curvature of a circle of constant latitude, except at the equator. West can be exchanged for east in this discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''radius of curvature in the [[prime vertical]]'' which is perpendicular (normal or [[orthogonal]]) to {{mvar|M}} at geodetic latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{mvar|N}} is defined as the radius of curvature in the plane that is normal to both the surface of the ellipsoid at, and the meridian passing through, the specific point of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N(\varphi)=\frac{a^2}{\sqrt{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This radius is also called the '''transverse radius of curvature'''. At the equator, {{math|''N'' {{=}} ''R''}}.

[[Image:EarthEllipRadii.jpg|445x445px|Three different radii as a function of Earth's latitude. {{mvar|R}} is the geocentric radius; {{mvar|M}} is the meridional radius of curvature; and {{mvar|N}} is the prime vertical radius of curvature.|frame]]

The Earth's meridional radius of curvature at the equator equals the meridian's [[semi-latus rectum]]:

:{{math|{{sfrac|''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''a''}}}}{{pad|1em}}={{pad|1em}}6,335.439&amp;nbsp;km

The Earth's polar radius of curvature is:
:{{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''b''}}}}{{pad|1em}}={{pad|1em}}6,399.594&amp;nbsp;km

====Directional====
The Earth's radius of curvature along a course at an [[azimuth]] (measured clockwise from north) {{mvar|α}} at {{mvar|φ}} is derived from [[Euler's theorem (differential geometry)|Euler's curvature formula]] as follows:&lt;ref name=Torge/&gt;{{rp|97}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{c}=\frac{1}{\dfrac{\cos^2\alpha}{M}+\dfrac{\sin^2\alpha}{N}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

====Combinations====
It is possible to combine the principal radii of curvature above in a non-directional manner.

{{anchor|Gaussian}}{{anchor|Gaussian radius of curvature}}The Earth's [[Gaussian curvature|Gaussian radius of curvature]] at latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref name=Torge&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA98 |title=Geodesy|work=google.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{a}=\sqrt{MN}=\frac{a^2b}{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|Mean radius of curvature}}The Earth's [[Mean curvature|mean radius of curvature]] at latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref name=Torge /&gt;{{rp|97}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{m}=\frac{2}{\dfrac{1}{M}+\dfrac{1}{N}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

====Geophysical extremes====
* '''Maximum:''' The summit of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] is {{convert|6384.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth's center.
* '''Minimum:''' The floor of the [[Arctic Ocean]] is approximately {{convert|6,352.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth's center.&lt;ref name=extrema&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guam.discover-theworld.com/Country_Guide.aspx?id=96&amp;entry=Mariana+Trench |title=Discover-TheWorld.com - Guam - POINTS OF INTEREST - Don't Miss - Mariana Trench |publisher=Guam.discover-theworld.com |date=1960-01-23 |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910021956/http://guam.discover-theworld.com/Country_Guide.aspx?id=96&amp;entry=Mariana+Trench |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global average radii{{anchor|Mean radii}}==
The Earth can be modeled as a sphere in many ways. This section describes the common ways. The various radii derived here use the notation and dimensions noted above for the Earth as derived from the [[WGS-84]] ellipsoid;&lt;ref name=tr8350_2 /&gt; namely,

:{{mvar|a}} = Equatorial radius ({{val|6378.1370|u=km}})
:{{mvar|b}} = Polar radius ({{val|6356.7523|u=km}})

A sphere being a gross approximation of the spheroid, which itself is an approximation of the geoid, units are given here in kilometers rather than the millimeter resolution appropriate for geodesy.

===Mean radius===
[[File:WGS84_mean_Earth_radius.svg|thumb|Equatorial (''a''), polar (''b'') and mean Earth radii as defined in the 1984 [[World Geodetic System]] revision (not to scale)]]
In geophysics, the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) defines the mean radius (denoted {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}) to be&lt;ref name="Moritz"&gt;Moritz, H. (1980). [ftp://athena.fsv.cvut.cz/ZFG/grs80-Moritz.pdf ''Geodetic Reference System 1980''], by resolution of the XVII General Assembly of the IUGG in Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac{2a+b}{3}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
For Earth, the mean radius is {{convert|6371.0088|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moritz |first=H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2000 |title=Geodetic Reference System 1980 |journal=Journal of Geodesy |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1007/s001900050278 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0bgccvjj5bedgdfu/about/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2000JGeod..74..128. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In astronomy, the [[International Astronomical Union]] denotes the ''nominal equatorial Earth radius'' as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^\mathrm N_\mathrm{eE}&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined to be {{convert|6378.1|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The ''nominal polar Earth radius'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^\mathrm N_\mathrm{pE}&lt;/math&gt; = {{convert|6356.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}. These values correspond to the zero tide radii. Equatorial radius is conventionally used as the nominal value unless the polar radius is explicitly required.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

===Authalic radius===
{{see also|Authalic latitude}}
Earth's authalic ("equal area") radius is the radius of a hypothetical perfect sphere that has the same surface area as the [[reference ellipsoid]]. The [[IUGG]] denotes the authalic radius as {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz"/&gt;

A closed-form solution exists for a spheroid:&lt;ref name="Snyder manual"&gt;Snyder, J.P. (1987). ''Map Projections – A Working Manual (US Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395)'' p. 16–17. Washington D.C: United States Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_2=\sqrt{\frac{a^2+\frac{ab^2}{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}\ln{\left(\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}b\right)}}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{a^2}2+\frac{b^2}2\frac{\tanh^{-1}e}e} =\sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} and {{mvar|A}} is the surface area of the spheroid.

For the Earth, the authalic radius is {{convert|6,371.0072|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Moritz2000/&gt;

===Volumetric radius===
Another spherical model is defined by the volumetric radius, which is the radius of a sphere of volume equal to the ellipsoid. The [[IUGG]] denotes the volumetric radius as {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_3=\sqrt[3]{a^2b}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For Earth, the volumetric radius equals {{convert|6,371.0008|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Moritz2000/&gt;

===Rectifying radius===
{{see also|Meridian arc#Polar distance|Rectifying latitude}}
Another mean radius is the ''rectifying radius'', giving a sphere with circumference equal to the [[circumference|perimeter]] of the ellipse described by any polar cross section of the ellipsoid. This requires an [[Circumference#Ellipse|elliptic integral]] to find, given the polar and equatorial radii:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sqrt{{a^2}\cos^2\varphi + {b^2} \sin^2\varphi}\,d\varphi\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The rectifying radius is equivalent to the meridional mean, which is defined as the average value of {{mvar|M}}:&lt;ref name="Snyder manual"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\!M(\varphi)\,d\varphi\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For integration limits of [0,{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}], the integrals for rectifying radius and mean radius evaluate to the same result, which, for Earth, amounts to {{convert|6,367.4491|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The meridional mean is well approximated by the semicubic mean of the two axes,
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}\approx\left(\frac{a^\frac32+b^\frac32}{2}\right)^\frac23\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which differs from the exact result by less than {{convert|1|um|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}; the mean of the two axes,
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}\approx\frac{a+b}{2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

about {{convert|6,367.445|km|mi|abbr=on}}, can also be used.

===Average distance from center to surface===
Most global mean radii are based on the [[reference ellipsoid]], which approximates the geoid. The geoid has no direct relationship with surface topography, however. An alternative calculation averages elevations everywhere, resulting in a mean radius {{val|230|u=m}} larger than the [[Earth radius#Mean radius|IUGG mean radius]], the [[Authalic radius|authalic radius]], or the [[Earth radius#Volumetric radius|volumetric radius]]. This average is {{convert|6371.230|km|mi|abbr=on}} with uncertainty of {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="chambat"&gt;{{cite article

==Osculating sphere==
The best spherical approximation to the ellipsoid in the vicinity of a given point is the [[osculating circle|osculating]] sphere. Its radius equals the Gaussian radius of curvature as above, and its radial direction coincides with the ellipsoid [[normal direction]]. The center of the osculating sphere is offset from the center of the ellipsoid, but is at [[center of curvature]] for the ellipsoid surface point involved. This concept aids the interpretation of terrestrial and planetary [[radio occultation]] [[refraction]] measurements and in some navigation and surveillance applications.

The first published reference to the Earth's size appeared around 350&amp;nbsp;BC, when [[Aristotle]] reported in his book ''[[On the Heavens]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|author-link=Aristotle|title=On the Heavens|orig-year=c. 350 BC|volume=Book II 298 B|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.html|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that mathematicians had guessed the circumference of the Earth to be 400,000 [[Stadia (length)|stadia]].

Earth-centered religion or [[nature worship]] is a system of religion based on the veneration of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/406588/nature-worship Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers any [[religion]] that [[worship]]s the [[earth]], [[nature]], or [[fertility deity]], such as the various forms of [[Mother Goddess|goddess worship]] or [[matriarchal religion]]. Some find a connection between earth-worship and the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. Earth religions are also formulated to allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the earth.

==Origins==
[[File:Annarbor tree.jpg|thumb]]

===Origin claims by earth religion sources===
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Old Europe (archaeology)|pre-Indo-European]] societies lived in small-scale, family-based communities that practiced [[matrilineal succession]] and goddess-centered religion&lt;ref name="From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2002 |last=French |first=Marilyn |title=From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyr9pwbqeqoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Slavic+matrilinear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iftdUb2HOoq-8AToy4G4BA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Slavic%20matrilinear&amp;f=false |publisher=McArthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; where creation comes from the woman. She is the Divine Mother who can give life and take it away. In [[Irish mythology]] she is [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], in [[Slavic mythology]] she is [[Mat Zemlya]], and in other cultures she is [[Pachamama]], [[Ninsun]], [[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]], [[Nüwa]], [[Matres and Matrones|Matres]] or [[Shakti]].

In the late 1800s, [[James Weir (1856-1906)|James Weir]] wrote an article describing the beginnings and aspects of early religious feeling. According to Boyer, early man was forced to locate food and shelter in order to survive, while constantly being directed by his instincts and senses. Because man's existence depended on nature, men began to form their religion and beliefs on and around nature itself. It is evident that man's first religion would have had to develop from the material world, he argues, because man relied heavily on his senses and what he could see, touch, and feel. In this sense, the [[nature worship|worship of nature]] formed, allowing man to further depend on nature for survival.&lt;ref name="Lust and Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weir|first=James|title=Lust and Religion|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26071/26071-h/26071-h.htm|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|format=EBook|date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopagans]] have tried to make claims that religion started in ways that correspond to earth religion. In one of their published works, ''The Urantia Book'',  another reason for this worship of nature came from a fear of the world around primitive man.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2" /&gt;  His mind lacked the complex function of processing and sifting through complex ideas. As a result, man worshiped the very entity that surrounded him every day. That entity was nature. Man experienced the different natural phenomena around him, such as storms, vast deserts, and immense mountains. Among the very first parts of nature to be worshiped were rocks and hills, plants and trees, animals, the elements, heavenly bodies, and even man himself. As primitive man worked his way through nature worship, he eventually moved on to incorporate spirits into his worship.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright Morning Star|title=The Urantia Book|year=2005|publisher=Uversa Press|location=New York|isbn=0965197220|pages=805–810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MfMsljJW3gC&amp;pg=PA806&amp;lpg=PA806&amp;dq=%22The+objects+of+worship+were+altogether+suggestive;+they+consisted+of+the+things+of+nature+which+were+close+at+hand,+or+which+loomed+large+in+the+commonplace+experience+of+the+simple-minded+primitive+Urantians%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IqLZ2C00XB&amp;sig=b8eFU33wB5hl6ekR_BZSjG3rpro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5ZIUZiOLsWTyQHrnoCQBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20objects%20of%20worship%20were%20altogether%20suggestive%3B%20they%20consisted%20of%20the%20things%20of%20nature%20which%20were%20close%20at%20hand%2C%20or%20which%20loomed%20large%20in%20the%20commonplace%20experience%20of%20the%20simple-minded%20primitive%20Urantians%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these claims may have some merit, they are nonetheless presented from a biased position that cannot be authenticated by traditional and reliable sources. Therefore, their claims can not be relied upon.

===Origins of religion===
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

The origins of religion can be looked at through the lens of the function and processing of the human mind. [[Pascal Boyer]] suggests that, for the longest period of time, the brain was thought of as a simple organ of the body. However, he claims that the more information collected about the brain indicates that the brain is indeed not a "blank slate."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained|year=2001|publisher=A Member of the Perseus Book club|location=New Work|isbn=0465006965|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans do not just learn any information from the environment and surroundings around them. They have acquired sophisticated cognitive equipment that prepares them to analyze information in their culture and determine which information is relevant and how to apply it. Boyer states that "having a normal human brain does not imply that you have religion. All it implies is that people can acquire it, which is very different."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; He suggests that religions started for the reasons of providing answers to humans, giving comfort, providing social order to society, and satisfying the need of the illusion-prone nature of the human mind.&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; Ultimately, religion came into existence because of our need to answer questions and hold together our societal order.

An additional idea on the origins of religion comes not from man's cognitive development, but from the ape. Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from apes. The closest relative to the human species is the African ape.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Barbara J.|title=Evolving God: A Provocative View of the Origins of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Doubleday Religion|location=New York|isbn=0385521553}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Mar 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At birth, the ape begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. The world the ape is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in the ape's life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of [[belongingness]], which is derived from its dependence on the ape's mother and family. Belongingness is defined as "mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;  This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the [[hominidae|hominid]] (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of the ape, which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

As severe changes in the environment, physical evolutions in the human body (especially in the development of the human brain), and changes in social actions occurred, humans went beyond trying to simply form bonds and relationships of empathy with others. As their culture and society became more complex, they began using practices and various symbols to make sense of the natural and spiritual world around them. Instead of simply trying to find belongingness and empathy from the relationships with others, humans created and evolved God and spirits in order to fulfil that need and exploration. King argued that "an earthly need for belonging led to human religious imagination and thus to the otherworldly realm of relating to God, gods, and spirits."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

==Encompassed religions==
The term ''earth religion'' encompasses any religion that worships the earth, nature or fertility gods or goddesses. There is an array of groups and beliefs that fall under earth religion, such as [[paganism]], which is a polytheistic, nature based religion; [[animism]], which is the worldview that all living entities (plants, animals, and humans) possess a spirit; [[Wicca]], who hold the concept of an earth mother goddess as well as practice ritual magic; and [[druidism]], which equates divinity with the natural world.

Another perspective of earth religion to consider is [[pantheism]], which takes a varied approach to the importance and purpose of the earth, and man's relationship with the planet. Several of their core statements deal with the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that "all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part" and "we are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WPM Statement of Principles|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheism|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth also plays a vital role to many Voltaic peoples, many of whom "consider the Earth to be Heaven’s wife",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimoń|first=Henryk|title=The Sacredness of the Earth Among the Konkomba of Northern Ghana|journal=Anthropos|year=2003|volume=98|issue=2|pages=421–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Konkomba]] of northern Ghana, whose economic, social and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. It is also important to consider various Native American religions, such as [[Peyote Religion]], [[Longhouse Religion]], and Earth Lodge Religion.

==Around the world==
April 22 was established as [[International Mother Earth Day]] by the [[United Nations]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10823.doc.htm |title=General Assembly Proclaims 22 April 'International Mother Earth Day' Adopting By Consensus Bolivia-Led Resolution |publisher=United Nations |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many cultures around the world have been celebrating the Earth for thousands of years. [[Winter solstice]] and [[Summer solstice]] are celebrated with holidays like [[Yule]] and [[Dongzhi Festival|Dongzhi]] in the winter and [[Tiregān]] and [[Kupala]] in the summer.

===Africa===
[[Animism]] is practiced among the [[Bantu peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rGpO_TzeCsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=nature+worship+in+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XENeUaTVH4ym9gT0uIH4AQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nature%20worship%20animism&amp;f=false |title=African Traditional Religion in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography p 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The [[Dahomey mythology]] has deities like [[Nana Buluku]], [[Gleti]], [[Mawu]],     [[Asase Yaa]], [[Naa Nyonmo]] and [[Xevioso]].

===Europe===
In [[Baltic mythology]], the sun is a female deity, [[Saulė|Saule]], a mother or a bride, and [[Mēness]] is the moon, father or husband, their children being the stars. In [[Slavic mythology]] [[Mokosh]] and [[Mat Zemlya]] together with [[Perun]] head up the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Celebrations and rituals are centered on nature and harvest seasons. [[Dragobete]] is a traditional [[Romanians|Romanian]] spring holiday that celebrates "the day when the birds are betrothed."

===India===
In [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[yoni]] is the creative power of nature and the [[origin of life]]. In [[Shaktism]], the yoni is celebrated and worshipped during the [[Ambubachi Mela]], an annual fertility festival which celebrates the Earth's [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|title=Celebrating The Divine Female Principle|last=Chawla|first=Janet|date=September 16, 2002|publisher=Boloji.com|accessdate=24 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100131031243/http://boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm| archivedate= 31 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Although the idea of earth religion has been around for thousands of years, it did not fully show up in popular culture until the early 1990s. ''[[The X-Files]]'' was one of the first nationally broadcast television programs to air [[witchcraft]] and [[Wicca]] (types of earth religion) content. On average, Wiccans - those who practice Wicca - were more or less pleased with the way the show had portrayed their ideals and beliefs. However, they still found it to be a little "sensationalistic". That same year, the movie ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' was released - also depicting the art of Wicca. Unfortunately, this cinematic feature was not as happily accepted as ''The X-Files'' had been.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Juggler|url=http://culture.pagannewswirecollective.com/2010/08/a-time-line-of-wiccan-pop-culture/|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, programs showcasing the aforementioned religious practices - such as ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' - became widely popular. Although ''Charmed'' focused mostly on witchcraft, the magic they practiced very closely resembled Wicca. Meanwhile, ''Buffy'' was one of the first shows to actually cast a Wiccan character. However, since the shows focus was primarily on [[Vampire|vampires]], the Wiccan was depicted as having supernatural powers, rather than being in-tuned with the Earth.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"/&gt;

Other movies and shows throughout the last few decades have also been placed under the genre of Earth Religion. Among them are two of director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s most well known films - ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. Both movies present human interaction with land, animal, and other nature spirits. Speakers for Earth Religion have said that these interactions suggest overtones of Earth Religion themes.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"&gt;{{cite web|last=krasskova|title=My Top 10 Pagan/Heathen Movies|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/11/my-top-10-paganheathen-movies/|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular Disney movies have also been viewed as Earth Religion films. Among them are ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]''. Those who practice Earth Religion view ''The Lion King'' as an Earth Religion film mainly for the "interconnectedness" and "Circle of Life" it shows between the animals, plants, and life in general. When that link is broken, viewers see chaos and despair spread throughout the once bountiful land. Congruently, ''Brother Bear'' portrays interactions and consequences when humans disobey or go against the animal and Earth spirits.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

Other earth religion movies include ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'', ''[[The Deceivers (film)]]'', ''[[Sorceress (1982 film)]]'', ''[[Anchoress (film)]]'', ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'', ''[[Agora (film)]]'', and ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)]]''. These movies all contain various aspects of earth religion and nature worship in general.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
[[File:Emirgan 04589.jpg|thumb]]

===Hindrance of progress===
Many religions have negative stereotypes of earth religion and neo-paganism in general. A common critique of the worship of nature and resources of "Mother Earth" is that the rights of nature and [[ecocide]] movements are inhibitors of human progress and development.&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley|title=Ecocide is Earth Religion|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/322526/ecocide-earth-religion|work=Human Exceptionalism|publisher=National Review Online|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This argument is fueled by the fact that those people socialized into 'western' world views believe the earth itself is not a living being. Wesley Smith believes this is “[[Antihumanism|anti-humanism]] with the potential to do real harm to the human family.”&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"/&gt; According to Smith, earth worshipers are hindering large-scale development, and they are viewed as inhibitors of advancement.

===Negative representatives===
A lot of criticism of earth religion comes from the negative actions of a few people who have been chastised for their actions. One such negative representative of earth religion is [[Aleister Crowley]]. He is believed to be "too preoccupied with awakening magical powers"&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=Herman|title=Earth Religion News|journal=geraldgardner.com|year=1976|volume=I|issue=1|pages=2–3|url=http://geraldgardner.com/archive/ern/Earth_Religion_News.php|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  instead of putting the well-being of others in his coven. Crowley allegedly looked up to [[George Pickingill|"Old George" Pickingill]], who was another worshipper of nature who was viewed negatively. Critics regarded Pickingill as a Satanist and "England’s most notorious Witch".&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

Crowley himself was "allegedly expelled from the Craft because he was a pervert."&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt; He became aroused by torture and pain, and enjoyed being "punished" by women.&lt;ref name="The Great Beast: Aleister Crowley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Symonds|first=John|title=The Great Beast|year=1952|publisher=Roy|isbn=0356036316|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically damaged Crowley’s public image, because of his lifestyle and actions. Many people regarded all followers of earth religion as perverted Satanists.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

===Accused of Satanism===
Followers of earth religion have suffered major opprobrium over the years for allegedly being [[Satanism|Satanists]]. Some religious adherents can be prone to viewing religions other than their religion as being wrong sometimes because they perceive those religions as characteristic of their concept of Satan worship. To wit, [[Witchcraft]], a common practice of [[Wicca]]ns, is sometimes misinterpreted as Satan worship by members of these groups, as well as less-informed persons who may not be specifically religious but who may reside within the sphere-of-influence of pagan-critical religious adherents. From the Wiccan perspective, however, earth religion and Wicca lie outside of the phenomenological world that encompasses Satanism.&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Wicca?|url=http://www.thecircleofthesacredwell.org/more_info/what_is_wicca.htm|work=An Eclectic Neopagan Circle|publisher=The Circle of the Sacred Well|accessdate=12 March 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Wicca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicca: a Neopagan, Earth-centered religion|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm|work=Religioustolerance.org|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-evil being does not exist within the religious perspective of western earth religions. Devotees worship and celebrate earth resources and earth-centric deities. Satanism and Wicca "have entirely different beliefs about deity, different rules for ethical behavior, different expectations from their membership, different views of the universe, different seasonal days of celebration, etc."&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"/&gt;

Neo-pagans, or earth religion followers, often claim to be unaffiliated with Satanism.&lt;ref name="Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/introductory/neo-pagan_satanism.php|work=Confusions and Distinctions|publisher=The Pagan Library|accessdate=20 March 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-pagans, Wiccans, and earth religion believers do not acknowledge the existence of a deity that conforms to the common Semitic sect religious concept of Satan. Satanism stems from Christianity, while earth religion stems from older religious concepts.&lt;ref name="Is Satanism Pagan?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vera|first=Diane|title=Is Satanism "Pagan"?|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/pagan/Is-Satanism-Pagan.html|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of Satanism as Religious Harassment====
Some earth religion adherents take issue with the religious harassment that is inherent in the social pressure that necessitates their having to distance themselves from the often non-uniform, Semitic sect religious concept of Satan worship. Having to define themselves as "other" from a religious concept that is not within their worldview implies a certain degree of outsider-facilitated, informal, but functional religious restriction that is based solely on the metaphysical and mythological religious beliefs of those outsiders. This is problematic because outsider initiated comparisons to Satanism with the intent of condemnation, even when easily refuted, can have the effect of social pressure on earth religion adherents to conform to outsider perception of acceptable customs, beliefs, and modes of religious behavior.

To illustrate, a problem could arise with the "other" than Satanism argument if an earth centered belief system adopted a holiday that a critic considered to be similar or identical to a holiday that Satanists celebrate. Satanists have historically been prone to adopting holidays that have origins in various pagan traditions, ostensibly because these traditional holidays are amongst the last known vestiges of traditional pre-Semitic religious practice in the west. Satanists are, perhaps irrationally, prone to interpreting non-Semitic holidays as anti-Christian and therefore as implicitly representative of their worldview. This is not surprising given the fact that this is, in fact, how many Christians interpret holidays such as [[Samhain]]. In spite of any flawed perceptions or rationale held by any other group, earth centered religion adherents do not recognize misinterpretation of their customs made by outside religious adherents or critics inclusive of Satan worshippers.

Organized Satan worship, as defined by and anchored in the Semitic worldview, is characterized by a relatively disorganized and often disparate series of movements and groups that mostly emerged in the mid-20th century. Thus, their adopted customs have varied, continue to vary, and therefore this moving target of beliefs and customs can not be justifiably nor continuously accounted for by earth centered religious adherents. Once a Satanist group adopts a holiday, social stigma may unjustifiably taint the holiday and anyone who observes it without discrimination as to whence and for what purpose it was originally celebrated. Given these facts, many earth centered religion devotees find comparisons to Satanism intrinsically oppressive in nature. This logic transfers to any and all religious customs to include prayer, magic, ceremony, and any unintentional similarity in deity characteristics (an example is the horned traditional entity Pan having similar physical characteristics to common horned depictions of Satan).

The issue is further complicated by the theory that the intra and extra-biblical mythology of Satan that is present throughout various Semitic sects may have originally evolved to figuratively demonize the heathen religions of other groups. Thus, the concept of Satan, or "the adversary", would have been representative of all non-Semitic religions and, by extension, the people who believed in them. Although, at times, the concept of the "other" as demonic has also been used to characterize competing Semitic sects. Amongst other purposes, such belief would have been extraordinarily useful during the psychological and physical process of cleansing Europe of traditional tribal beliefs in favor of Christianity. This possibility would account for the historical tendency of Christian authorities, for example, to deem most pagan customs carried out in the pagan religious context as demonic. By any modern standard, such current beliefs would violate western concepts of religious tolerance as well as be inimical to the preservation of what remains of the culture of long-persecuted religious groups.

==Ethics==
Because of the vast diversity of religions that fall under the title of ''earth religion'' there is no consensus of beliefs.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede" /&gt;  However, the [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs of most religions overlap. The most well-known ethical code is the [[Wiccan Rede]]. Many of those who practice an earth religion choose to be environmentally active. Some perform activities such as recycling or composting while others feel it to be more productive to try and support the earth spiritually.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt; These six beliefs about ethics seem to be universal.

===The Wiccan Rede===
"An [if] it harm none, do what ye will."&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Commonly worded in modern English as "if it doesn't harm anyone, do what you want."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Piper|first=David|title=Wiccan Ethics And The Wiccan Rede|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/ethics/wiccan_ethics_rede.php|publisher=paganlibrary.com|accessdate=15 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This maxim was first printed in 1964, after being spoken by the priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-20th century, and governs most ethical belief of Wiccans and some Pagans. There is no consensus of beliefs but this rede provides a starting point for most people's interpretation of what is ethical.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought"&gt;{{cite web|last=McColman|first=Carl|title=Principles of Moral Thought and Action|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Pagan/Ethics-Morality-Community/Principles-of-Moral-Thought-and-Action.html|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=14 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiccan Statement of Principles" /&gt;   The [[Wiccan Rede|rede]] clearly states to do no harm but what constitutes as harm and what level of self-interest is acceptable is negotiable.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="All About You" /&gt;  Many Wiccans reverse the phrase into "Do what ye will an it harm none," meaning "Do what you want if it doesn't harm anyone."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; The difference may not seem significant but it is. The first implies that it is good to do no harm but does not say that it is necessarily unethical to do so, the second implies that all forms of harm are unethical. The second phrase is nearly impossible to follow. This shift occurred when trying to better adapt the phrase into modern English as well as to stress the "harmlessness" of Wiccans. The true nature of the rede simply implies that there is personal responsibility for your actions. You may do as you wish but there is a [[karma]] reaction from every action.&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; Even though this is the most well-known rede of practice, it does not mean that those that choose not to follow it are unethical. There are many other laws of practice that other groups follow.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lark|title=Beyond The Wiccan Rede - Other Pagan Ethics|url=http://realpagan.net/forum/topics/beyond-the-wiccan-rede-other|publisher=realpagan.net|accessdate=15 Mar 2013|date=22 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Threefold Law===
[[Rule of Three (Wicca)|The Threefold Law]] is the belief that for all actions there is always a cause and effect. For every action taken either the good or ill intention will be returned to the action taker threefold. This is why the Wiccan Rede is typically followed because of fear of the threefold return from that harmful action.&lt;ref name=Threefold&gt;{{cite web|last=Wren|title=The Law of Three|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usfl&amp;c=basics&amp;id=2872|publisher=witchvox.com|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|date=16 Jul 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor===
[[File:Leaf at Rocky Point of McDonald Lake.jpg|thumb]]
This term is what [[Emma Restall Orr]] calls reverence for the earth in her book ''Living with Honour: A Pagan Ethics''. She separates the term into three sections: courage, generosity and loyalty, or honesty, respect and responsibility. There is no evil force in Nature.&lt;ref name=Honor /&gt;&lt;ref name="WFT Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|title=WFT Ethics|url=http://www.wiccanfamilytemple.org/wft-ethics|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing exists beyond the natural, therefore it is up to the individual to choose to be ethical not because of divine judgment.

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = In energy economics, energy systems are usually defined as technical and economic systems meeting the energy demand.  "However, the energy demand is not a fixed quantity but is subject to various influences, e.g., prices, regulations, and consumer preferences. Thus, the definition of energy systems should provide a much broader, socioeconomic view and refer to the technical and economic side of energy supply as well as the socioeconomic phenomena occurring in a society, which uses energy to enhance its standard of living; furthermore the impact on the natural environment is important. ... It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means. (page 941)

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10228">'''Ethical naturalism''' (also called '''moral naturalism''' or '''naturalistic cognitivistic definism''')&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|Rosen|1967|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:

# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion.
# These moral features of the world ''are'' [[reductionism|reducible]] to some set of non-moral features

==Overview==
It is important to distinguish the versions of ethical naturalism which have received the most sustained philosophical interest, for example, [[Cornell realism]], from the position that "the way things are is always the way they ought to be", which few ethical naturalists hold. Ethical naturalism does, however, reject the [[fact-value distinction]]: it suggests that inquiry into the natural world can increase our moral knowledge in just the same way it increases our scientific knowledge. Indeed, proponents of ethical naturalism have argued that humanity needs to invest in the [[science of morality]], a broad and loosely defined field that uses evidence from biology, primatology, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience, and other areas to classify and describe moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Science of Morality|url=https://www.edge.org/event/the-new-science-of-morality|website=edge.org|publisher=Edge Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=Oct 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Greg|title=The Roots of Morality|url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/articles/miller.2008.roots-of-morality.science.pdf|accessdate=October 27, 2017|agency=Science Magazine|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|date=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical naturalism encompasses any reduction of ethical properties, such as 'goodness', to non-ethical properties; there are many different examples of such reductions, and thus many different varieties of ethical naturalism. [[Hedonism]], for example, is the view that goodness is ultimately just [[pleasure]].

==Ethical theories that can be naturalistic==
*[[Altruism (ethics)|Altruism]]
*[[Consequentialism]]
*[[Consequentialist libertarianism]]
*[[Cornell realism]]
*[[Ethical egoism]]
*[[Evolutionary ethics]]
*[[Hedonism]]
*[[Secular ethics#Humanist ethics|Humanistic ethics]]
*[[Moral skepticism]]
*[[Natural-rights libertarianism]]
*[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]
*[[Utilitarianism]]
*[[Virtue ethics]]

==Criticisms==
Ethical naturalism has been criticized most prominently by [[ethical non-naturalist]] [[G. E. Moore]], who formulated the [[open-question argument]]. Garner and Rosen say that a common definition of "natural property" is one "which can be discovered by sense observation or experience, experiment, or through any of the available means of science." They also say that a good definition of "natural property" is problematic but that "it is only in criticism of naturalism, or in an attempt to distinguish between naturalistic and nonnaturalistic definist theories, that such a concept is needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|Rosen|1967|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. M. Hare]] also criticised ethical naturalism because of its fallacious definition of the terms 'good' or 'right' explaining how value-terms being part of our prescriptive moral language are not reducible to descriptive terms: "Value-terms have a special function in language, that of commending; and so they plainly cannot be defined in terms of other words which themselves do not perform this function".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hare|M.R.|1964|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral relativism===
When it comes to the moral questions that we might ask, it can be difficult to argue that there is not necessarily some level of [[Moral relativism|meta-ethical relativism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} – and failure to address this matter is criticized as [[ethnocentrism]]. [[File:The punishment of Bessus by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Could torture under certain conditions be "wrong" for a species?]]

As a broad example of relativism, we would no doubt see very different moral systems in an alien race that can only survive by occasionally ingesting one another. As a narrow example, there would be further specific moral opinions for each individual of that species.

Some forms of [[moral realism]] are compatible with some degree of meta-ethical relativism. This argument rests on the assumption that one can have a "moral" discussion on various scales; that is, what is "good" for: a certain part of your being (leaving open the possibility of conflicting motives), you as a single individual, your family, your society, your species, your type of species. For example, a [[moral universalism|moral universalist]] (and certainly an [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]]) might argue that, just as one can discuss what is 'good and evil' at an individual's level, so too can one make certain "moral" propositions with truth values relative at the level of the species. In other words, the moral relativist need not deem ''all'' moral propositions as necessarily subjective. The answer to "''is free speech normally good for human societies?''" is relative in a sense, but the moral realist would argue that an individual can be incorrect in this matter. This may be the philosophical equivalent of the more pragmatic arguments made by some scientists.

===Moral nihilism===
[[Moral nihilism|Moral nihilists]] maintain that any talk of an objective morality is incoherent and better off using other terms. Proponents of [[Science of morality|moral science]] like Ronald A. Lindsay have counter-argued that their way of understanding "morality" as a practical enterprise is the way we ought to have understood it in the first place. He holds the position that the alternative seems to be the elaborate philosophical reduction of the word "moral" into a vacuous, useless term.&lt;ref name=Ron&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/centerstage/episodes/episode_24_bioethics_and_public_policy_part_1 Center Stage | Episode 24 – Bioethics and Public Policy, Part 1]. Center for Inquiry (2010-04-12). Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay adds that it is important to reclaim the specific word "Morality" because of the connotations it holds with many individuals.

==Morality as a science==

{{Main|Science of morality}}

Author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] has argued that we overestimate the relevance of many arguments against the science of morality, arguments he believes scientists happily and rightly disregard in other domains of science like physics. For example, scientists may find themselves attempting to argue against philosophical [[Skepticism|skeptics]], when Harris says they should be practically asking – as they would in any other domain – "why would we listen to a [[solipsism|solipsist]] in the first place?" This, Harris contends, is part of what it means to practice a science of morality.

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] believes that conceiving of morality as a science could be a case of [[scientific imperialism]] and insists that what is "good for conscious creatures" is not an adequate working definition of "moral".&lt;ref name="blogs.discovermagazine.com"&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/29/sam-harris-responds/ Sam Harris Responds | Cosmic Variance | Discover Magazine]. Blogs.discovermagazine.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, Vice President at the [[Center for Inquiry]], John Shook, claims that this working definition is more than adequate for science at present, and that disagreement should not immobilize the scientific study of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/sam_harris_vs._the_philosophers_on_morality/ Sam Harris vs. The Philosophers on Morality]. Center for Inquiry (2010-05-14). Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the collective ''The End of Christianity'', Richard Carrier's chapter "Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)" sets out to propose a form of [[moral realism]] centered on human satisfaction.{{Explain|date=June 2018|reason=What Carrier says and why Carrier contribution is worth mention VS other philosophers }}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=W. Loftus (ed.) |first1=John |title=The end of Christianity |date=2011 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, N.Y. |isbn=9781616144135 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kXbaUE8cT64C&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Shishapangma.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sam Harris argues that there are societally optimal "moral peaks" to discover.]]
In modern times, many thinkers discussing the [[fact–value distinction]] and the [[is–ought problem]] have settled on the idea that one cannot derive ''ought'' from ''is''. Conversely, Harris maintains that the fact-value distinction is a confusion, proposing that values are really a certain kind of fact. Specifically, Harris suggests that values amount to empirical statements about "the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society". He argues that there are objective answers to moral questions, even if some are difficult or impossible to possess in practice. In this way, he says, science can tell us what to value. Harris adds that we do not demand absolute certainty from predictions in physics so we should not demand that of a science studying morality (see ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'').

[[File:Red Knot from The Crossley ID Guide Eastern Birds.jpg|thumb|A species plate from ''The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern Birds'', illustrating different plumages of the [[red knot]]]]
A '''field guide''' is a [[book]] designed to help the reader identify [[wildlife]] (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. [[mineral]]s). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/bix/fieldguides/index.html The International Field Guides Database]. Diane Schmidt. Accessed September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include [[identification key]]s to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 ''How to Know the Wildflowers'' by "Mrs. William Starr Dana" ([[Frances Theodora Parsons]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1890, [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]] published ''Birds Through an Opera-Glass'', describing 70 common species.  Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Mark V.|title=A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691044026|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist [[Vernon Orlando Bailey|Vernon Bailey]]), she published ''Handbook of Birds of the Western United States''.  By contrast, the ''Handbook'' is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by [[taxonomic order]] and had clear descriptions of [[species]] size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kofalk|first=Harriet|title=No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist|date=1989|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|location=College Station, TX|isbn=0-89096-378-9|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by [[Chester A. Reed]] and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Thomas R.|title=In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders &amp; Their Guides|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199734597|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Roger Tory Peterson]], using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the "[[Peterson Identification System]]", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from [[animal tracks]] to [[seashell]]s and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization.  Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the [[Audubon Society]],  the [[RSPB]], the [[Field Studies Council]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[HarperCollins]], and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of [[identification key]]s. Plant field guides such as ''Newcomb's Wildflower Guide'' (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Lawrence|title=Newcomb's Wildflower Guide|date=1977|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-60442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:

{{quote|A drawing can do much more than a photograph to emphasize the field marks. A photograph is a record of a fleeting instant; a drawing is a composite of the artist's experience. The artist can edit out, show field marks to best advantage, and delete unnecessary clutter. He can choose position and stress basic color and pattern unmodified by transitory light and shade. ... The artist has more options and far more control .... Whereas a photograph can have a living immediacy a good drawing is really more instructive.  (This passage was written not by Roger Tory Peterson, but by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of Peterson's field guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|title=A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern and Central North America|date=1989|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This passage was also quoted by Law and Lynch (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lists, Field Guides, and the Descriptive Organization of Seeing: Birdwatching as an Exemplary Observational Activity|author1=Law, John  |author2=Michael Lynch|journal= Human Studies|volume= 11|issue= 2/3|date=1988|pages=271–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pearson, D. L.  |author2=Shetterly, J. A. |date=2006|title=How do published field guides influence interactions between amateurs and professionals in entomology? |journal=American Entomologist |volume=52|issue=4|pages=246–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1037">The '''Fowkes hypothesis''' (after F. M. Fowkes) is a first order approximation for surface energy. It states the surface energy is the sum of each component's forces:
 
γ=γ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;+γ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;+γ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;+...
where γ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; is the dispersion component, γ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; is the polar, γ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the dipole and so on.

The Fowkes hypothesis goes further making the approximation that the interface between an apolar liquid and apolar solid where there are only dispersive interactions acting across the interface can be estimated using the [[geometric mean]] of the contributions from each surface i.e.

γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt;=γ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;+γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-2(γ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; x γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''''Freddy Fox''''' ({{ISBN|0-9754701-0-8}}) is a [[hardcover]] [[picture book]] written and illustrated by [[Ronald J. Meyer]]. It tells the story of a young fox and his family, following the daily activities of the fox kit, Freddy.  Freddy Fox teaches the reader about [[red fox]]es, including that they are born shades of gray, how their den is built, what they eat, and family size. Then through a simple segue, Freddy's red fox mother teaches the young fox about other animals and traits attributed to them.  By learning his lessons, Freddy will grow up to be a wise fox.  All of the lessons, such as the [[bear]] eats a balanced diet or the [[raccoon]] washes his hands before eating, can easily be translated into lessons for young children.

The book was first published in 2004. It won the Silver [[Mom's Choice Award]] in the "Animal Kingdom" category in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momschoiceawards.com/celebrate08.php Mom's Choice Awards 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225071706/http://www.momschoiceawards.com/celebrate08.php |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author is a [[wildlife photography|wildlife photographer]], and he used his wildlife photographs to illustrate the book.

[[File:Geologic Clock with events and periods.svg|thumb|right|325px|Geologic time represented in a diagram called a geological clock, showing the relative lengths of the eons of Earth's history and noting major events]]
The '''geological history of Earth''' follows the major events in Earth's past based on the [[geological time scale]], a system of [[Chronological dating|chronological measurement]] based on the study of the planet's rock layers ([[stratigraphy]]). Earth formed [[Age of the Earth|about 4.54 billion years ago]] by accretion from the [[solar nebula]], a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas left over from the formation of the Sun, which also created the rest of the [[Solar System]].

Earth was initially molten due to extreme [[volcanism]] and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]] when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [[Moon]] formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a planetoid with the Earth. [[Outgassing]] and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing [[water vapor]], augmented by ice delivered from [[comet]]s, [[Origin of water on Earth|produced the oceans]].

As the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. They [[Plate tectonics|migrated across the surface]], occasionally combining to form a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly {{Ma|750}}, the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], {{Ma|600|540}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart {{Ma|200}}.

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}, then intensified at the end of the [[Pliocene]]. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000&amp;nbsp;years. The [[last glacial period]] of the [[Quaternary ice age|current ice age]] ended about 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.

== Precambrian ==
{{Life timeline}}
{{Main|Precambrian}}
The Precambrian includes approximately 90% of geologic time. It extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (about 541 [[annum|Ma]]).  It includes three eons, the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic.

Major volcanic events altering the Earth's environment and causing extinctions may have occurred 10 times in the past 3 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rsquo-s-lost-history-of-planet-altering-eruptions-revealed/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_ENGYSUS_NEWS|title=Earth's Lost History of Planet-Altering Eruptions Revealed|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hadean Eon ===
{{Main|Hadean}}
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]
During Hadean time (4.6&amp;ndash;4 [[annum|Ga]]), the [[Solar System]] was forming, probably within a large cloud of gas and dust around the sun, called an [[accretion disc]] from which [[History of Earth#Origin|Earth formed]] {{Ma|4500}}.&lt;ref name="age_earth"&gt;{{cite book | first=G.B. | last=Dalrymple | date=1991 | title=The Age of the Earth | publisher=Stanford University Press | location=California | isbn=0-8047-1569-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hadean Eon is not formally recognized, but it essentially marks the era before we have adequate record of significant solid rocks.

[[Earth]] was initially molten due to extreme [[volcanism]] and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]] when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [[Moon]] formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact]] of a large planetoid with the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Canup, R.

During the Hadean the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] occurred (approximately {{Ma|4100|3800}}) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon, and by inference on Earth, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] as well.

=== Archean Eon ===
{{Main|Archean}}
The Earth of the early Archean ({{Ma|4000|2500}}) may have had a different tectonic style. During this time, the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to [[Subduction|subduct]] and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of [[erosion]] and subsequent [[tectonic]] events.

In contrast to the [[Proterozoic]], Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as [[graywacke]]s, [[mudstone]]s, volcanic sediments and [[banded iron formation]]s. [[Greenstone belt]]s are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic [[island arc]]s, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island rocks and deposited in a [[forearc|forearc basin]]. In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=302&amp;ndash;303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth's [[magnetic field]] was established 3.5 billion years ago. The [[solar wind]] flux was about 100 times the value of the modern [[Sun]], so the presence of the magnetic field helped prevent the planet's atmosphere from being stripped away, which is what probably happened to the [[atmosphere of Mars]]. However, the field strength was lower than at present and the [[magnetosphere]] was about half the modern radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Oldest measurement of Earth's magnetic field reveals battle between Sun and Earth for our atmosphere | date=March 4, 2010 | work=Physorg.news | url=http://www.physorg.com/news186922627.html | accessdate=2010-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proterozoic Eon ===
{{Main|Proterozoic}}
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ({{Ma|2500|541}}) is more complete than that for the preceding [[Archean]]. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many [[stratum|strata]] that were laid down in extensive shallow [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental seas]]; furthermore, many of these rocks are less [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid [[continent]]al accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), [[supercontinent cycle]]s, and wholly modern [[orogeny|orogenic]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=315&amp;ndash;318, 329&amp;ndash;332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly {{Ma|750}},&lt;ref name="ICS2008"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5nDdmUWXk?url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2008.pdf International Stratigraphic Chart 2008, International Commission on Stratigraphy]&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], 600–540&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Murphy, J. B. |author2=Nance, R. D. | title=How do supercontinents assemble? | journal=American Scientist | date=1965 | volume=92 | issue=4 | pages=324–333 | url=http://scienceweek.com/2004/sa040730-5.htm | accessdate=2007-03-05 | doi=10.1511/2004.4.324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic, one began shortly after the beginning of the eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the [[Snowball Earth]] of the Varangian glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=320&amp;ndash;321, 325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phanerozoic Eon ==
{{Main|Phanerozoic}}
The '''Phanerozoic''' Eon is the current eon in the geologic timescale. It covers roughly 541&amp;nbsp;million years. During this period continents drifted about, eventually collected into a single landmass known as [[Pangea]] and then split up into the current continental landmasses.

The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras – the [[Paleozoic]], the [[Mesozoic]] and the [[Cenozoic]].

Most of biological evolution occurred during this time period.

=== Paleozoic Era ===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The '''Paleozoic''' spanned from roughly {{Ma|541|252}} (Ma)&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; and is subdivided into six [[period (geology)|geologic periods]]; from oldest to youngest they are the [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], [[Devonian Period|Devonian]], [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]]. Geologically, the [[Paleozoic]] starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called [[Pannotia]] and at the end of a global ice age. Throughout the early Paleozoic, the Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called [[Pangaea]], which included most of the Earth's land area.

==== Cambrian Period ====
{{Main|Cambrian}}
The '''Cambrian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; [[Cambrian]] continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a [[Neoproterozoic]] supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]] and [[Siberia]] remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. [[Gondwana]] started to drift toward the South Pole. [[Panthalassa]] covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]], [[Iapetus Ocean]] and [[Khanty Ocean]].

==== Ordovician period ====
{{Main|Ordovician}}
The '''Ordovician''' period started at a major extinction event called the [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]] some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt;  During the [[Ordovician]] the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but [[Baltica]] began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, [[Avalonia]] broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The [[Rheic Ocean]] was formed as a result of this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.

The Ordovician came to a close in a series of [[extinction event]]s that, taken together, comprise the second-largest of the five major extinction events in [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] in terms of percentage of [[genus|genera]] that became extinct. The only larger one was the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The extinctions occurred approximately {{Ma|447|444}} &lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following [[Silurian]] Period.

The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an [[ice age]], in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable [[greenhouse]] conditions typical of the Ordovician. The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen [[isotope]]s in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it. Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.

==== Silurian Period ====
{{Main|Silurian}}
The '''Silurian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; During the [[Silurian]], Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in [[sea level]]s, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an [[unconformity]]. Other [[craton]]s and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as [[Euramerica]]. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed [[Ural Ocean]].

==== Devonian Period ====
{{Main|Devonian}}
The '''Devonian''' spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as [[Laurasia]] and Gondwana drew closer together. The continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and forming the [[Caledonian Mountains]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).

==== Carboniferous Period ====
{{Main|Carboniferous}}
The '''Carboniferous''' extends from about 358.9 ± 0.4 to about 298.9 ± 0.15 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the [[Carboniferous]]; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]]. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush [[coal]] swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [[crinoid]]s and [[ammonite]]s especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the [[Mississippian Period]] from the [[Pennsylvanian period]].&lt;ref name="Stanley, 414"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern [[North America]]. This continental collision resulted in the [[Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=414&amp;ndash;416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural mountains]]. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]], and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.

==== Permian Period ====
{{Main|Permian}}
The '''Permian''' extends from about 298.9 ± 0.15 to 252.17 ± 0.06 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Permian]] all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (''[[Panthalassa]]'', the ''universal sea''), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("continental climate") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea.

=== Mesozoic Era ===
{{Main|Mesozoic}}
[[File:249 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- {{Ma|249}}]]
[[File:290 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- {{Ma|290}}]]
The '''Mesozoic''' extended roughly from {{Ma|252|Cenozoic}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

After the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] tectonic deformation was comparatively mild. Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent, [[Laurasia]], and a southern continent, [[Gondwana]]. This created the [[passive continental margin]] that characterizes most of the [[Atlantic]] coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.

==== Triassic Period ====
{{Main|Triassic}}
The '''Triassic''' Period extends from about 252.17 ± 0.06 to 201.3 ± 0.2 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  During the [[Triassic]], almost all the Earth's land mass was concentrated into a single [[supercontinent]] centered more or less on the equator, called [[Pangaea]] ("all the land"). This took the form of a giant "[[Pac-Man]]" with an east-facing "mouth"  constituting the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys sea]], a vast gulf that opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic, at the expense of the shrinking [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that existed during the [[Paleozoic]].

The remainder was the world-ocean known as [[Panthalassa]] ("all the sea"). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through [[subduction]] of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean. The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic&amp;mdash;especially late in the period&amp;mdash;but had not yet separated. The first nonmarine sediments in the [[rift]] that marks the initial break-up of Pangea&amp;mdash;which separated [[New Jersey]] from [[Morocco]]&amp;mdash;are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the [[Newark Supergroup]].&lt;ref name=lasdtri&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in [[Western Europe]], where the Triassic was first studied. In [[North America]], for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus Triassic [[stratigraphy]] is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as ''Estheria'' crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sereno P.

==== Jurassic Period ====
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The '''Jurassic''' Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;
During the early [[Jurassic]], the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] broke up into the northern supercontinent [[Laurasia]] and the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]] opened in the new rift between North America and what is now [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The Jurassic North [[Atlantic Ocean]] was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.&lt;ref name=panjur2&gt;{{cite web

| title = Pangea Begins to Rift Apart

| publisher = C. R. Scotese
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys Sea]] closed, and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Neotethys]] basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of [[glacier|glaciation]]. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western [[Europe]], where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]] and the renowned late Jurassic ''[[lagerstätte]]n'' of [[Holzmaden]] and [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen]].&lt;ref name=lasdjur&gt;{{cite web

In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |title=Jurassic Rocks – 208 to 146 million years ago |accessdate=2007-07-19 |work=nationalatlas.gov |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930212425/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |archivedate=2014-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental]] [[Sundance Sea]] left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits of the [[Morrison Formation]]. The first of several massive [[batholith]]s were emplaced in the northern [[American cordillera|Cordillera]] beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the [[Nevadan orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe and Wicander, 607.&lt;/ref&gt; Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, [[Australasia]] and the United Kingdom.

==== Cretaceous Period ====
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
[[File:100 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- 100 Ma,&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; [[Cretaceous]] period]]
The '''Cretaceous''' Period extends from circa {{Ma|145.0}} to {{Ma|Paleogene}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Cretaceous]], the late [[Paleozoic]]-early Mesozoic [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] completed its breakup into present day [[continent]]s, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened, the convergent-margin [[orogeny|orogenies]] that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the [[American cordillera|North American Cordillera]], as the [[Nevadan orogeny]] was followed by the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier]] and [[Laramide orogeny|Laramide orogenies]]. Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, [[Gondwana]] itself broke up as [[South America]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] rifted away from [[Africa]] (though [[India]] and [[Madagascar]] remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [[sea level|eustatic sea levels]] worldwide.

To the north of Africa the [[Tethys Sea]] continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central [[North America]] (the [[Western Interior Seaway]]) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between [[coal]] beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous [[transgression (geology)|transgression]], one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Dougal Dixon et al., ''Atlas of Life on Earth'', (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 2001), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cretaceous is justly famous for its [[chalk]]; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the [[Phanerozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mid-ocean ridge]] activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for [[Coccolithophores|calcareous nanoplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=279&amp;ndash;281}}&lt;/ref&gt; These widespread [[carbonate]]s and other [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary deposits]] make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous [[Geologic formation|formations]] from North America include the rich marine fossils of [[Kansas]]'s [[Smoky Hill Chalk|Smoky Hill Chalk Member]] and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in [[Europe]] and [[China]]. In the area that is now India, massive [[lava]] beds called the [[Deccan Traps]] were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

=== Cenozoic Era ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The '''Cenozoic''' Era covers the {{period start|Cenozoic}}&amp;nbsp;million years since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] up to and including the present day. By the end of the [[Mesozoic]] era, the continents had rifted into nearly their present form. [[Laurasia]] became [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]], while [[Gondwana]] split into [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Antarctica]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], which collided with the Asian plate. This impact gave rise to the Himalayas. The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the [[Mediterranean sea]].

==== Paleogene Period ====
{{Main|Paleogene}}
The '''Paleogene''' (alternatively '''Palaeogene''') [[geologic period|Period]] is a unit of [[geologic time]] that began {{period start|Paleogene}} and ended 23.03 Ma&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and comprises the first part of the [[Cenozoic]] Era. This period consists of the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] Epochs.

===== Paleocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Paleocene}}
The '''Paleocene''', lasted from {{Ma|Paleocene}} to {{Ma|56.0}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

In many ways, the [[Paleocene]] continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the [[continent]]s continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent [[Laurasia]] had not yet separated into three continents. [[Europe]] and [[Greenland]] were still connected. [[North America]] and [[Asia]] were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate.&lt;ref name="Hooker"&gt;Hooker, J.J., "Tertiary to Present: Paleocene", pp. 459-465, Vol. 5. of Selley, Richard C., L. Robin McCocks, and Ian R. Plimer, Encyclopedia of Geology, Oxford: Elsevier Limited, 2005. {{ISBN|0-12-636380-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laramide orogeny]] of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the [[Neogene]]); the components of the former southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] continued to split apart, with [[Africa]], South America, [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward [[Europe]], slowly closing the [[Tethys Ocean]], and [[India]] began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the [[Himalayas]].

===== Eocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Eocene}}
During the '''[[Eocene]]''' ({{Ma|56.0}} - {{Ma|33.9}}),&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm [[equator]]ial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 [[annum|Ma]], the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The northern [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]] began to break up, as [[Europe]], [[Greenland]] and [[North America]] drifted apart. In western North America, [[Orogeny|mountain building]] started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts. In Europe, the [[Tethys Sea]] finally vanished, while the uplift of the [[Alps]] isolated its final remnant, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and created another shallow sea with island [[archipelago]]s to the north. Though the North [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. [[India]] continued its journey away from [[Africa]] and began its collision with [[Asia]], creating the [[Himalaya]]n orogeny.

===== Oligocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Oligocene}}
The '''Oligocene''' Epoch extends from about {{Ma|34}} to {{Ma|23}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; During the [[Oligocene]] the continents continued to drift toward their present positions.

[[Antarctica]] continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent [[ice cap]]. [[Orogeny|Mountain building]] in western [[North America]] continued, and the [[Alps]] started to rise in [[Europe]] as the [[African Plate|African plate]] continued to push north into the [[Eurasian plate]], isolating the remnants of [[Tethys Sea]]. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] since the [[Fauna (animals)|faunas]] of the two regions are very similar. During the Oligocene, [[South America]] was finally detached from [[Antarctica]] and drifted north toward [[North America]]. It also allowed the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.

==== Neogene Period ====
{{Main|Neogene}}
The '''Neogene''' Period is a unit of [[geologic timescale|geologic time]] starting 23.03 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and ends at 2.588 Ma.  The Neogene Period follows the [[Paleogene]] Period. The Neogene consists of the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] and is followed by the [[Quaternary]] Period.

===== Miocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Miocene}}
The '''Miocene''' extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Miocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between [[South America]] and [[North America]] was absent, the subduction zone along the [[Pacific Ocean]] margin of South America caused the rise of the [[Andes]] and the southward extension of the [[Meso-American]] peninsula. [[India]] continued to collide with [[Asia]]. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as [[Africa]] collided with [[Eurasia]] in the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Arabia]]n region between 19 and 12 [[annum|Ma]] ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western [[Mediterranean]] region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] near the end of the Miocene.

===== Pliocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pliocene}}
The '''Pliocene''' extends from {{Ma|5.333}} to {{Ma|2.588}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  During the [[Pliocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions, moving from positions possibly as far as {{convert|250|km|mi|0}} from their present locations to positions only 70&amp;nbsp;km from their current locations.

South America became linked to North America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]] during the Pliocene, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [[Marsupialia|marsupial]] faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. [[Africa]]'s collision with [[Europe]] formed the [[Mediterranean Sea]], cutting off the remnants of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between [[Alaska]] and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about {{Ma|2.58}} (the start of the Quaternary Period), the [[Quaternary glaciation|current ice age]] began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000&amp;nbsp;years.

==== Quaternary Period ====
{{Main|Quaternary}}

===== Pleistocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pleistocene}}
The '''Pleistocene''' extends from {{Ma|2.588}} to 11,700 years before present.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  The modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions during the [[Pleistocene]], the [[tectonic plate|plates]] upon which they sit probably having moved no more than {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} relative to each other since the beginning of the period.

===== Holocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Holocene}}
[[File:Earth dry elevation.stl|thumb|right|Current Earth - without water (click/enlarge to "spin" 3D-globe).]]
The '''Holocene''' Epoch began approximately 11,700 calendar years before present&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and continues to the present. During the [[Holocene]], continental motions have been less than a kilometer.

The [[last glacial period]] of the [[Quaternary ice age|current ice age]] ended about 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/paleoclimate.htm | title = Paleoclimatology - The Study of Ancient Climates | publisher = Page Paleontology Science Center | accessdate = 2007-03-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/617EaUwHQ?url=http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/paleoclimate.htm | archivedate = 2011-08-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice melt caused world [[Sea level rise|sea levels to rise]] about {{convert|35|m|ft|0}} in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene [[glacier]]s and rose as much as {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from [[Vermont]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]] and [[Michigan]]. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. [[Post-glacial rebound]] in [[Scandinavia]] resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the [[Baltic Sea]], including much of [[Finland]]. The region continues to rise, still causing weak [[earthquake]]s across [[Northern Europe]]. The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of [[Hudson Bay]], as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial [[Tyrrell Sea]] phase, to near its present boundaries.

The '''Global Earthquake Model (GEM)''' is a [[public–private partnership]] initiated in 2006 by the Global Science Forum of the OECD to develop global, [[open-source software|open-source]] risk assessment software and tools. With committed backing from [[academia]], governments and industry, GEM contributes to achieving profound, lasting reductions in [[earthquake]] risk worldwide by following the priorities of the Hyogo Framework for Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.unisdr.org/eng/hfa/hfa.htm | title=Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) - UNISDR}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 to 2013 GEM is constructing its first working global earthquake model and will provide an authoritative standard for calculating and communicating earthquake risk worldwide.

Since March 2009, GEM is a legal entity in the form of a non-profit foundation based in Pavia, Italy. The GEM Secretariat is hosted at the European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering (EUCENTRE). The current secretary general is John Schneider.

Between 2000 and 2010 over half a million people died due to earthquakes and [[tsunamis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/world_deaths.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011012207/http://www.earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/world_deaths.php |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of these in the developing world, where risks increase due to rapid population growth and [[urbanization]].&lt;ref&gt;see a.o. http://www.geohazards.no/projects/project3_08/project_3_earthq.htm - figure2&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many earthquake-prone regions no [[risk model]]s exist, and even where models do exist, they are inaccessible. Better risk-awareness can reduce the toll that earthquakes take by leading to better construction, improved emergency response, and greater access to insurance.

GEM will provide a basis for comparing earthquake risks across regions and across borders, and thereby take the necessary first step towards increased awareness and actions that reduce earthquake risk. GEM tools will be usable at the community, national and international level for uniform earthquake risk-evaluation and as a defensible basis for risk-mitigation plans. GEM results will be disseminated all over the world. GEM will build technical capacity and carry out awareness-raising activities.

== Scientific framework ==

The GEM scientific framework serves as the underlying basis for constructing the global earthquake model, and is organised in three principal integrated modules: [[seismic hazard]], [[seismic risk]] and socio-economic impact.

* The hazard module calculates harmonised probabilities of earthquake occurrence and resulting shaking at any given location.
* The risk module calculates damage and direct losses resulting from this damage such as fatalities, injuries and cost of repair. Damage due to strong ground shaking is calculated by combining building vulnerability, population vulnerability and exposure. GEM will furthermore develop remote-sensing and crowd-data collection techniques to classify, monitor and regularly update building inventory and thus regional vulnerability.
* The socio-economic impact module of GEM will provide tools and indices to both estimate and communicate the impact from earthquakes on the economy and society, concentrating in particular on indirect losses. For example, the impact on a company's revenue, on budgets, on poverty. The module will allow for calculations of scenarios which that enable cost/benefit analysis of mitigating actions, such as systematic building strengthening, and facilitate insurance and [[alternative risk transfer]].

== Implementation ==

It will take five years to build the first working global earthquake model – including corresponding tools, software and datasets. The work started in 2009 and will be finished at the end of 2013. Construction occurs in various stages that are partly overlapping in time. The pilot project GEM1 (January 2009 – March 2010) generates GEM’s first products and initial model building infrastructure, Global components will establish a common set of definitions, strategies, standards, quality criteria and formats for the compilation of databases that serve as an input to the global earthquake model. They are addressed by international consortia that respond to calls for proposals on [[Seismic hazard|hazard]], [[Seismic risk|risk]] and socio-economic impact. Global components will provide preliminary data on a global scale, but on a local scale, regional and national programmes will provide more detailed and reliable data. One Global component was the Global GMPEs project that proposed a set of [[Engineering Seismology|ground motion prediction equations]] for use when calculating [[seismic hazard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Jonathan P.|last2=Douglas|first2=John|last3=Javanbarg|first3=Mohammad|last4=Bozorgnia|first4=Yousef|last5=Abrahamson|first5=Norman A.|last6=Boore|first6=David M.|last7=Campbell|first7=Kenneth W.|last8=Delavaud|first8=Elise|last9=Erdik|first9=Mustafa|date=2015-02-01|title=Selection of Ground Motion Prediction Equations for the Global Earthquake Model|journal=Earthquake Spectra|language=EN|volume=31|issue=1|pages=19–45|doi=10.1193/013013eqs017m|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/53375/1/Stewart_etal_ES_2015_Selection_of_ground_motion_prediction_equations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The data produced on a regional and national scale will be carefully quality-controlled and integrated into the global models. The actual development of the model will occur using a common, web-based platform for dynamic  sharing of tools and resources, in order to create software and online tools as end-products. The global earthquake model will be tested and evaluated before its official release; the testing procedure will involve the establishment of scientific experiments that are reproducible, transparent, and set up within a controlled environment.

GEM is however more than the creation and release of this first version of the model. GEM strives for continuous improvement of the model and will ensure that results are disseminated, technology is transferred through training and workshops and that awareness raising activities are deployed in order to contribute to risk reduction worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18436">{{short description|A theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic ray protons}}
The '''Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit''' ('''GZK limit''') is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}}, or about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]] has been detected which appeared to possess a record {{val|3.12|e=20|u=eV}} (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35&amp;nbsp;mph baseball).

The GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aab|first1=Aexander|last2=others|title=Inferences on Mass Composition and Tests of Hadronic Interactions from 0.3 to 100 EeV using the water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=Submitted to Phys. Rev. D|date=2017|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that [[Lorentz covariance]] is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by [[Kenneth Greisen]],&lt;ref name="Greisen1966"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greisen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |date=1966 |title=End to the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum? |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=748&amp;ndash;750 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.748 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1966PhRvL..16..748G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vadim Kuzmin (physicist)|Vadim Kuzmin]], and [[Georgiy Zatsepin]],&lt;ref name="Zatsepin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatsepin |first=G. T. |last2=Kuz'min |first2=V. A. |date=1966 |title=Upper Limit of the Spectrum of Cosmic Rays |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=4 |issue= |pages=78&amp;ndash;80 |bibcode=1966JETPL...4...78Z |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1624/article_24846.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interactions between [[cosmic ray]]s and the photons of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}} would interact with cosmic microwave background photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}&lt;/math&gt;, relatively [[blueshift]]ed by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce [[pion]]s via the [[Delta baryon|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; resonance]],

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow p + \pi^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow n + \pi^+.&lt;/math&gt;
Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron [[pair production]] (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about {{val|e=17|ul=eV}}. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than {{val|50|ul=Mpc}} ({{val|163|ul=Mly}}) and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

==Cosmic ray paradox==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess [[energy|energies]] that are theoretically too high, given that there are no possible near-Earth sources, and that rays from distant sources should have scattered off the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]?}}

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments [[Akeno Giant Air Shower Array]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and [[Telescope Array Project]] that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called '''GZK paradox''' or '''cosmic ray paradox'''.

These observations appear to contradict the predictions of [[special relativity]] and [[particle physics]] as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
*The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
*The cosmic rays could have local sources well within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).
*Cosmic rays are mostly heavier nuclei with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons. The energy per nucleon in a nucleus is by a factor &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; lower, which correspondingly pushes the effective GZK limit for the whole nucleus up by a factor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For iron nuclei (the heaviest abundant element in cosmic rays), the corresponding energy limit for the whole nucleus is {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}, which is well beyond the energies of detected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

===Weakly interacting particles===
Another suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, [[neutrino]]s) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fargion |first1=D. |last2=Mele |first2=B. |last3=Salis |first3=A. |title=Ultra–High‐Energy Neutrino Scattering onto Relic Light Neutrinos in the Galactic Halo as a Possible Source of the Highest Energy Extragalactic Cosmic Rays |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=June 1999 |volume=517 |issue=2 |pages=725–733 |doi=10.1086/307203 |arxiv=astro-ph/9710029 |bibcode=1999ApJ...517..725F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:

&lt;math&gt;\nu + \bar{\nu}\rightarrow Z\rightarrow \text{hadrons}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called "resonance"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2 m_{\nu}}= 4.2\times 10^{21} \left(\frac{\text{eV}}{m_{\nu}}\right)\text{eV}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the Z-boson and &lt;math&gt;m_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the neutrino.

===Other theories===
A number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including [[doubly special relativity]]. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other possible theories involve [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray#Relation with dark matter|a relation with dark matter]], decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the [[Standard Model]].

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the [[AGASA]] experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment]] (HiRes) and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit.&lt;ref name="Abbasi2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbasi |first=R. U. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=First Observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Suppression |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue= 10|pages=101101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.101101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18352170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703099 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100j1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events.&lt;ref name="Abraham2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abraham |first=J. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 | title=Observation of the suppression of the flux of cosmic rays above 4×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; eV |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=061101–1–061101–7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.061101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0806.4302 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101f1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. According to [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]], spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above {{val|e=18|u=eV}} using the Pierre Auger Observatory|url=|journal=Phys. Lett. B|volume=685|issue=4&amp;ndash;5|pages=239&amp;ndash;246|arxiv=1002.1975|bibcode=2010PhLB..685..239A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.013|pmid=|quote=|author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1010.2690|author1=Sokolsky|author2=for the HiRes Collaboration|title=Final Results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment|class=astro-ph.HE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"/&gt;
The [[Telescope Array Project]], a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons.&lt;ref name="Hanlon2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanlon|first1=William|last2=others|title=Telescope Array Composition Summary|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=536|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/536/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference.&lt;ref name="deSouza2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=Vitor|last2=others|title=Testing the agreement between the Xmax distributions measured by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=522|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/522/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
[[Extreme Universe Space Observatory|EUSO]], which was scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-[[fluorescence]] technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to resolve inconsistencies===
Launched in June 2008, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
*With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormes |first=Jonathan F. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2000 |title=The origin of cosmic rays: What can the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope say? |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=528 |issue= |pages=445&amp;ndash;448 |id= |doi=10.1063/1.1324357 |quote= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UHECR protons accelerated (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]) in astrophysical objects produce ''secondary electromagnetic cascades'' during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK-process of pion production is one of the contributors. Such cascades can contribute between ≃1% and ≃50% of the GeV-TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the [[EGRET]] experiment. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope may discover this flux.&lt;ref name="Kalashev2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalashev |first=Oleg E. |authorlink= |author2=Semikoz, Dmitry V. |author3=Sigl, Guenter |date=2007 |title=Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and the GeV-TeV Diffuse Gamma-Ray Flux |journal=Physical Review D |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=063005 |arxiv=0704.2463 |bibcode=2009PhRvD..79f3005K|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sources of UHECRs==
In November 2007, researchers at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the [[Philippe Véron|Véron-Cetty-Véron]] catalog. These results are reported in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2007 |title=Correlation of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5852 |pages=938&amp;ndash;943 |doi=10.1126/science.1151124 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0711.2256 |pmid=17991855 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..938P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2010 |title=Update on the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with nearby extragalactic matter |journal=Astropart.

An '''information society''' is a [[society]] where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of [[information]] is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. Its main drivers are digital [[information and communication technologies]], which have resulted in an [[information explosion]] and are profoundly changing all aspects of social organization, including the [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, M.

Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |authorlink= James R. Beniger |date=1986 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University Press|title-link= The Control Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The markers of this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some combination of all of these.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Frank |title=Theories of the Information Society |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information society is seen as the successor to [[industrial society]]. Closely related concepts are the [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]), [[post-fordism]], [[postmodernity|post-modern]] society, knowledge society, telematic society, [[Information Revolution]], [[liquid modernity]], and [[network society]] ([[Manuel Castells]]).

==Definition==
There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be termed information society and what shall rather not so be termed. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen that started somewhere between the 1970s and today and is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the [[internet]], and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. Frank Webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society: technological, economic, occupational, spatial and cultural.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Webster, the character of information has transformed the way that we live today. How we conduct ourselves centers around theoretical knowledge and information.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (2006). Chapter 2: What is an information society? In ''Theories of the Information Society'', 3rd ed. (pp. 15-31). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasiwulaya and Gomo (Makerere University) allude{{Where|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Exactly where do they make this allusion (if allusions are even worth bothering with)? --&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- If they don't dare say it but merely allude to it, why are we bothering with this? --&gt; that information societies are those that have intensified their use of IT for economic, social, cultural and political transformation. In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information
Society in the [[Tunis Commitment]] and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase.

Some people, such as [[Antonio Negri]], characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour. By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function?  For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It ''is'' now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend's performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development.

[[Michael Buckland]] characterizes information in society in his book ''Information and Society.'' Buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=Michael|title=Information in Society|date=March 3, 2017|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the [[Japanese society]]) as an information society because we think of it as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], 1996, 6{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT, published by Boyle in 1996? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Kasiwulaya and Walter, Makerere University. Makerere University Press.{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The word information may be interpreted in many different ways. According to Buckland in ''Information and Society'', most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge: information as knowledge, information as a process, and information as a thing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information and Society|last=Buckland|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hilbert InfoGrowth.png|thumb|right|360px|The amount of data stored globally has increased greatly since the 1980s, and by 2007, 94% of it was stored digitally. [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html Source]]]

The growth of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways, including society's technological capacity to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information. It is estimated that, the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 60 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo "video animation on The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%. The world’s combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt; The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

[[James R. Beniger]] describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: “The need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)” (p.&amp;nbsp;174)
“Even with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.”(p.&amp;nbsp;175)&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"/&gt;

==Development of the information society model==
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|right|thumb|450px|Colin Clark (economist)|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]
One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist [[Fritz Machlup]]. In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study ''The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States'' in 1962. This book was widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;Susan Crawford: "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=227258 The Origin and Development of a Concept: The Information Society]". ''Bull Med Libr Assoc.'' 71(4) October 1983: 380–385.&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or ''jōhōka shakai'', [[:ja:情報化社会|情報化社会]]).

The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or [[information economy]], [[post-industrial society]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]] society, [[network society]], the [[information revolution]], informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades.

Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the [[knowledge economy|knowledge industry]]. He began studying the effects of patents on research before distinguishing five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning|last=Rooney|first=Jim|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited|year=2014|isbn=978-1-910309-71-1|location=UK|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machlup|first1=Fritz|title=The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States|date=1962|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=What's the year referring to?|date=November 2009}}

=== Economic transition ===
[[Peter Drucker]] has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Drucker]] (1969) ''The Age of Discontinuity''. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Porat]] distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Porat]] (1977) The Information Economy. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The [[OECD]] has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.&lt;ref name=deutsch1983&gt;Karl Deutsch (1983) Soziale und politische Aspekte der Informationsgesellschaft. In: Philipp Sonntag (Ed.) (1983) Die Zukunft der Informationsgesellschaft. Frankfurt/Main: Haag &amp; Herchen. pp. 68-88&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Daniel Bell]] the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. "A post-industrial society is based on services. (…) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (…) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell]] (1976) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Basic Books, 127, 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Touraine]] already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. "The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities" (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]] (1984) ''The Postmodern Condition''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 5&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that "knowledge has become the {{sic|principle}} force of production over the last few decades". Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society.

Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter. [[Radovan Richta]] (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production (Aristovnik 2014: 55).

[[Nico Stehr]] (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. "Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge" (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

Also [[Alvin Toffler]] argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: "In a Third Wave economy, the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values –  is actionable knowledge" (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994).

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the [[network society]] gained importance in information society theory. For [[Manuel Castells]], network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). "One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" (Castells 2000: 21). "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

[[Jan Van Dijk]] (2006) defines the network society as a "social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)" (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. [[Darin Barney]] uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Darin Barney]] (2003) The Network Society. Cambridge: Polity, 25sq&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
The major critique of concepts such as information society, knowledge society, network society, postmodern society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. "If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new" (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]] argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adopt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and [[cultural capital]]. They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century, [[corporate capitalism]] in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).

For describing contemporary society based on a dialectic of the old and the new, continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like:
* transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism ([[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2008, 2007): "Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society." (Fuchs 2008: 110+119).
* digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also [[Peter Glotz]]):&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Glotz]] (1999) Die beschleunigte Gesellschaft. Kulturkämpfe im digitalen Kapitalismus. München: Kindler.&lt;/ref&gt; "networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before" (Schiller 2000: xiv)
* virtual capitalism: the "combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital" (Dawson/[[John Bellamy Foster]] 1998: 63sq),
* high-tech capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] (2003) High-Tech-Kapitalismus. Hamburg: Argument.&lt;/ref&gt; or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy.

Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism ([[Manuel Castells]] 2000, [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by "information generation, processing, and transmission" that have become "the fundamental sources of productivity and power" (Castells 2000: 21). The "most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism" (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500). [[Nicholas Garnham]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Garnham]] (2004) Information Society Theory as Ideology. In: Frank Webster (Ed.) (2004) The Information Society Reader. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is critical of Castells and argues that the latter’s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new "mode of development" is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn't the only driving force of society.

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour "that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response" (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and [[affective labor|affective labour]] that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.).

Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ([[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] 1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause [[structural unemployment]], rising poverty, [[social exclusion]], the [[deregulation]] of the [[welfare state]] and of [[labour rights]], the lowering of wages, welfare, etc.

Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

==Second and third nature==
{{One source section|date=August 2017}}
Information society is the means of getting information from one place to another.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=22}} As technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing this information with each other.

"Second nature" refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=23}} They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=21}}

However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=24}} From here, something called "third nature" has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to ‘speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from else where.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=25}} It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=26}} As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society.

Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=28}}

==Sociological uses==

In [[sociology]], '''''informational society''''' refers to a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] type of society. Theoreticians like [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Manuel Castells]] argue that since the 1970s a transformation from [[industrial society]] to informational society has happened on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] 2007. Periodization of History: A theoretic-mathematical analysis. In: [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53184&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=1 ''History &amp; Mathematics''].

As [[steam power]] was the technology standing behind industrial society, so [[information technology]] is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book ''[[Future Shock]]'', [[Alvin Toffler]] used the phrase '''super-industrial society''' to describe this type of society.  Other writers and thinkers have used terms like "[[post-industrial society]]" and "post-modern industrial society" with a similar meaning.

== Related terms ==
A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order.  The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society.  The [[Information Age]] is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the [[knowledge economy]], rather than an emerging economic order.  The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded.  The [[computer revolution]], and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The [[Information Revolution]] relates with the well known terms agricultural revolution and [[industrial revolution]].
* The [[information economy]] and the [[knowledge economy]] emphasize the [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] or [[intellectual property]] that is being traded through an information market or [[knowledge market]], respectively. [[Electronic commerce]] and [[electronic business]] emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the [[Internet]] and [[World-Wide Web]].  The [[digital economy]] focuses on trading bits in [[cyberspace]] rather than atoms in physical space.  The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units. [[Social networking]] refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales.  The [[internet economy]] focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet.
* Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates [[Knowledge management]], within a [[Knowledge organization]], that trades in a [[Knowledge market]]. In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing.  Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society.  Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged.
* In connection with the development of the information society, appeared [[information pollution]], evolving [[information ecology]] - associated with information [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub Eryomin A.L. Information ecology - a viewpoint]// International Journal of Environmental Studies. - 1998. - Vol. 54. - pp. 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, It is important to selectively select the information. Due to information revolution, the amount of information is puzzling. Among these, we need to develop techniques that refine information. This is called ''data mining.'' It is an engineering term, but it is used in sociology. In other words, if the amount of information was competitive in the past, the quality of information is important today.

==Intellectual property considerations==
One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to [[intellectual property]]. Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because [[copy protection]] is often easily circumvented and socially ''rejected'' because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute [[commodification]] of the facts and information that compose their environment.

Responses to this concern range from the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make [[copy protection]] (see [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]) circumvention illegal, to the [[free software]], [[open source]] and [[copyleft]] movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the "freedom" of various information products (traditionally both as in "gratis" or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share).

Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like "we all do internet now"; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. Because we lack political control of intellectual property, we are lacking in a concrete map of issues, an analysis of costs and benefits, and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. “A Politics of Intellectual Property: Environmentalism for the Net?” Duke Law Journal, vol. 47, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–116.

[[Image:Beetle collection.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Beetle]] collection at the [[Melbourne Museum]], Australia]]
'''Insect collecting''' refers to the collection of [[insect]]s and other [[arthropod]]s for scientific study or as a [[hobby]]. Because most insects are small and the majority cannot be identified without the examination of minute morphological characters, [[entomologist]]s often make and maintain insect collections. Very large collections are conserved in [[natural history museum]]s or [[University|universities]] where they are maintained and studied by specialists. Many college courses require students to form small collections. There are also amateur entomologists and collectors who keep collections.

Historically, insect collecting has been widespread and was in the [[Victorian age]] a very popular educational [[hobby]]. Insect collecting has left traces in European [[cultural history]], literature and songs (e.g., [[Georges Brassens]]'s ''La chasse aux papillons'' (''The Hunt for Butterflies'')). The practice is still widespread in many countries, and is particularly common among [[Japan]]ese youths.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Collecting techniques==
{{details|Insect trap}}
[[Image:Robinson trap.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Moth trap|Robinson light trap]] for collecting moths]]
Insects are passively caught using [[Tullgren funnel|funnels]], [[pitfall trap]]s, [[Bottle trap for insects|bottle traps]], [[Malaise Trap|malaise traps]], [[flight interception trap]]s and other passive types of [[insect trap]]s, some of which are baited with small bits of sweet foods (such as honey). Different designs of ultraviolet light traps such as the [[Robinson trap]] are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects (especially moths) during faunistic survey studies. Aspirators or "[[pooter]]s" suck up insects too small or delicate to handle with fingers.&lt;ref name=" Martin, J.E.H. 1977 " &gt;Martin, J.E.H. 1977.

[[Image:Little Haven Nature Reserve, sweep-netting - geograph.org.uk - 1581841.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sweep netting for grassland insects]]
Several different types of nets are commonly used to actively collect insects. [[Butterfly net|Aerial insect nets]] are used to collect flying insects. The bag of a butterfly net is generally constructed from a lightweight mesh to minimize damage to delicate [[butterfly]] wings. A [[sweep net]] is used to collect insects from grass and brush. It is similar to a butterfly net, except that the bag is generally constructed from more rugged material.The sweep net is swept back and forth through vegetation quickly turning the opening from side to side and following a shallow figure eight pattern. The collector walks forward while sweeping, and the net is moved through plants and grasses with force.This requires a heavy net fabric such as sailcloth to prevent tearing, although light nets can be used if swept less vigorously. Sweeping continues for some distance and then the net is flipped over, with the bag hanging over the rim, trapping the insects until they can be removed with a pooter. Other types of nets used for collecting insects include [[beating net]]s and aquatic nets.&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;[[Charles Valentine Riley]], 1892 ''Directions for collecting and preserving insects'' Bulletin (United States National Museum) no. 39, pt. F. Washington,Govt. Printing Off. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20176  Full text online here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leaf litter sieve]]s are used by [[Coleoptera|coleopterists]] and to collect larvae.

Once collected, a [[killing jar]] is used to kill required insects before they damage themselves trying to escape. However, killing jars are generally only used on hard-bodied insects.  Soft-bodied insects, such as those in the [[larvae|larval]] stage, are generally [[Fixation (histology)|fixed]] in a vial containing an [[ethanol]] and water solution.&lt;ref name ="Hongfu, Zhu, 1949" &gt;Hongfu, Zhu, 1949 ''How to know the immature insects; an illustrated key for identifying the orders and families of many of the immature insects with suggestions for collecting, rearing and studying them, by H.

==Storage and curation==
{{details|Entomological equipment for mounting and storage}}
[[Image:MuseumfürNaturkundeInsectPreparation (2).jpg|thumb|left|Equipment for preparation]]
The usual method of display is in a glass-covered box, with the insects mounted on specially made non corrosive [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|insect pins]] stuck into suitable foam plastic or paper covered cork at the bottom of the box. Common [[pin]]s are not used. Very small insects may be pinned on "minuten" (very tiny headless pins) stuck into a block of foam plastic on a standard insect pin. Alternatively they may be glued onto a small piece of card on the pin. There are specific procedures for proper mounting that are used to show off the insects' essential characteristics. Techniques and equipment may be varied to deal with various species or requirements. For example, one or both of the wings of a [[beetle]] or [[grasshopper]] can be pulled open and fanned out to show the wing structure that otherwise would be hidden. At least the date and place of capture should be written or computer printed onto a piece of paper or card transfixed by the pin. This is called a data label.&lt;ref name="Uys &amp; Urban"&gt;V.M. Uys &amp; R.P. Urban (Eds.): "How to Collect and Preserve Insects and Arachnids". Pretoria 2006. 112 p. {{ISBN|1-86849-311-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Insect Safari - beetle 36.jpg|thumb|200px|Part of a beetle collection. The insects are transfixed by entomological pins which allow handling and which also pierce the data label]]

Rare insects, or those from distant parts of the world, may also be acquired from dealers or by trading. Some noted insect collections have been sold at [[auction]].&lt;ref name ="Murray S. Upton, 1997" &gt;"A rich and diverse [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] : the history of the [[Australian National Insect Collection]]; 1926–1991".

Janet Lembke's first book was ''Bronze and Iron: Old Latin Poetry from Its Beginnings to 100 B.C.'' (1973), but beyond  translations and essays about classics, there were more than a dozen books on nature, works for which the author acquired a base of admirers. Her articles were printed in [[The New York Times]], ''[http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/ Sierra Magazine]'' ([[The Sierra Club]]), [[Oxford American]], [[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]], [[Raleigh News and Observer]], [[Southern Review]] and other publications. The writing style was eclectic and personal, meditative and detailed, and though she was at least once accused of "taking poetic license too far"&lt;ref name="bryn_mawr"&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-06.html Criticism of Lembke's translation of ''The Georgics'']. ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in her translation of ''Georgics'', readers were often charmed and seduced by her way of weaving scientific fact, history and culture, with personal anecdote, mythological allusion and poetic feeling. "The author's ability to pull together disparate elements in her writing is impressive, and her passionate connection with the natural world is displayed in line after line," wrote [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref name="skinnydipping_nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/books/in-short-nonfiction-040029.html|title=SKINNY DIPPING And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human. By Janet Lembke.|last=Hanson|first=Elizabeth|date=18 December 1994|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Annie Proulx]] expressed a similar perception, observing that "Lembke's writing tacks between three points: the stuff of her late-twentieth-century life; the tangle of creature and plant in every dimension of tide and river flow; and the haunting, connecting wires of mythos that still knot us  to the ancient beginnings."&lt;ref name="Lembke2003"&gt;Annie Proulx on Lembke: {{cite book|author=Janet Lembke|title=The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDNtM_f1tdEC&amp;pg=PA214|year=2003|publisher=[[Lyons Press]]|isbn=978-1-59228-128-2|pages=214–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Janet Lembke's noted titles were ''Because the Cat Purrs: How We Relate to Other Species and Why It Matters'' (2008); ''Skinny Dipping: And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human'' (2004); ''Dangerous Birds'' (1996); ''River Time'' (1997); ''Despicable Species: On Cowbirds, Kudzu, Hornworms, and Other Scourges'' (1999); and ''The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well'' (2004)-- a sober and unflinching account of the death of the author's mother. At the time of her own death at age 80 in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia (state)|Virginia]], Janet Lembke was working on a memoir, ''I Married an Arsonist''. She had married twice, and had four children and six grandchildren.&lt;ref name="janet_obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140110102633/http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 January 2014 |title=Obituary: Janet N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2283">The '''Jaramillo reversal''' was a [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversal]] and [[Geomagnetic excursion|excursion]] of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] that occurred approximately one million years ago. In the geological time scale it was a "short-term" positive reversal in the then-dominant Matuyama reversed magnetic chronozone; its beginning is widely dated to 990,000 years before the present ([[Before Present|BP]]), and its end to 950,000 BP (though an alternative date of 1.07 million years ago to 990,000 is also found in the scientific literature).&lt;ref&gt;Herrero-Bervera, Emilio, and S.

''Philosophical Transactions: Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences,'' Vol. 355 No. 1730 (September 15, 1997), pp. 1713–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes and mechanisms of short-term reversals and excursions like the Jaramillo, as well as the major field reversals like the [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal]], are subjects of study and dispute among researchers. One theory associates the Jaramillo with the [[Lake Bosumtwi|Bosumtwi impact event]], as evidenced by a [[tektite]] [[strewnfield]] in the [[Ivory Coast]],&lt;ref&gt;Glass, B. P., Swincki, M.

The '''level of support for evolution''' among scientists, the public and other groups is a topic that frequently arises in the [[creation-evolution controversy]] and touches on educational, religious, philosophical, scientific and political issues. The subject is especially contentious in countries where significant levels of non-acceptance of evolution by general society exist although [[evolution]] is taught at school and university.

Nearly all (around 97%) of the scientific community accepts evolution as the dominant scientific theory of biological diversity.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |last=Delgado |first=Cynthia |title=Finding evolution in medicine |journal=NIH Record |volume=58 |issue=15 |accessdate=2007-10-22 |date=2006-07-28 |format=hmtl |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122022815/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific associations have strongly rebutted and refuted the challenges to evolution proposed by [[intelligent design]] proponents.&lt;ref name="dover_pg83"&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

There are religious sects and denominations in several countries for whom the theory of evolution is in conflict with creationism that is central to their beliefs, and who therefore reject it: in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/id/1006378/ | title = George W.

In 1986, an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief, signed by 72 US Nobel Prize winners, 17 state academies of science and 7 other scientific societies, asked the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'', to reject a [[Louisiana]] state law requiring that where evolutionary science was taught in public schools, creation science must also be taught. The brief also stated that the term "creation science" as used by the law embodied religious dogma, and that "teaching religious ideas mislabeled as science is detrimental to scientific education".&lt;ref name=amicus&gt;Amicus Curiae brief in {{cite court |litigants=Edwards v.

There are many scientific and scholarly organizations from around the world that have issued statements in support of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/science List of numerous US scientific societies that support evolution and their statements about evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsu.org/Gestion/img/ICSU_DOC_DOWNLOAD/1017_DD_FILE_IAP_Evolution.pdf List of 68 international scientific societies on the Interacademy Panel (IAP) that endorse a resolution supporting evolution and a multibillion year old earth, June 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/1999/nsb99149/nsb99149.txt National Science Board letter in support of evolution 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298 ''Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design'', 11 Apr 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the world's largest general scientific society with more than 130,000 members and over 262 affiliated societies and academies of science including over 10 million individuals, has made several statements and issued several press releases in support of evolution.&lt;ref name="AAAS Denounces Anti-Evolution Laws"/&gt; The prestigious [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], which provides science advice to the nation, has published several books supporting evolution and criticising creationism and intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/ ''Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition'', National Academy of Sciences, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071117073919/http://orsted.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5787&amp;page=R1 ''Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science (1998)'', National Academy of Sciences, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a notable difference between the opinion of scientists and that of the general public in the United States. A 2009 poll by [[Pew Research Center]] found that "Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time – 87% say evolution is due to natural processes, such as natural selection. The dominant position among scientists – that living things have evolved due to natural processes – is shared by only about a third (32%) of the public."&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[[Pew Research Center]]: "[http://people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/ Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media]" July 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Votes, resolutions and statements of scientists before 1985===
One of the earliest resolutions in support of evolution was issued by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1922, and readopted in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.aaas.org/docs/resolutions.php?doc_id=450 ''AAAS Resolution: Present Scientific Status of the Theory of Evolution''], [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], Adopted by the AAAS Council, December 26, 1922. AAAS Executive Committee readopts this resolution on April 21, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm ''The Imminent Demise of Evolution: The Longest Running Falsehood in Creationism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207173612/http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm |date=2009-02-07 }}, G. R. Morton, Copyright 2002 G.R. Morton&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early effort to express support for evolution by scientists was organized by Nobel Prize–winning American biologist [[Hermann J. Muller]] in 1966. Muller circulated a petition entitled "Is Biological Evolution a Principle of Nature that has been well established by Science?" in May 1966:

{{quotation|There are no hypotheses, alternative to the principle of evolution with its "tree of life," that any competent biologist of today takes seriously. Moreover, the principle is so important for an understanding of the world we live in and of ourselves that the public in general, including students taking biology in high school, should be made aware of it, and of the fact that it is firmly established, even as the rotundity of the earth is firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Bales, James D., ''Forty-Two Years on the Firing Line'', Lambert, Shreveport, LA, p.71-72, no date.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This manifesto was signed by 177 of the leading American biologists, including [[George Gaylord Simpson|George G. Simpson]] of [[Harvard University]], Nobel Prize Winner [[Peter Agre]] of [[Duke University]], [[Carl Sagan]] of [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[John Tyler Bonner]] of [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Nobel Prize Winner [[George Beadle]], President of the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Donald Kennedy|Donald F. Kennedy]] of [[Stanford University]], formerly head of the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=DayScientistsVoted&gt;[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/1981 ''The Day the Scientists Voted'', Bert Thompson, Apologetics Press: Sensible Science, 2001, originally published in Reason &amp; Revelation, 2(3):9-11, March 1982.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the passing of a resolution by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) in the fall of 1972 that stated, in part, "the theory of creation ... is neither scientifically grounded nor capable of performing the rules required of science theories".&lt;ref name=ABT&gt;American Biology Teacher, January 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] also passed a similar resolution in the fall of 1972.&lt;ref name=ABT/&gt; A statement on evolution called "A Statement Affirming Evolution as a Principle of Science." was signed by Nobel Prize Winner [[Linus Pauling]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[George Gaylord Simpson|George G. Simpson]], Caltech Biology Professor [[Norman H. Horowitz]], [[Ernst Mayr]], and others, and published in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''A Statement Affirming Evolution as a Principle of Science,'' The Humanist, January/February, 1977, p. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The governing board of the [[American Geological Institute]] issued a statement supporting resolution in November 1981.&lt;ref&gt;AAPG Explorer, January, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly thereafter, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] passed another resolution supporting evolution and disparaging efforts to teach [[creationism]] in science classes.&lt;ref&gt;''"Creation-Science" Law Is Struck Down,'' Raloff, J., Science News, 121[2]:20, January 9, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, there are no scientifically peer-reviewed research articles that disclaim evolution listed in the scientific and medical journal search engine [[Pubmed]].&lt;ref name="pmid16670753"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Attie AD | title=Defending science education against intelligent design: a call to action | journal=J Clin Invest | date= 2006 | volume= 116 | issue= 5 | pages= 1134–8 | pmid=16670753 | doi=10.1172/JCI28449 | pmc=1451210 |name-list-format=vanc| author2=Sober E | author3=Numbers RL | author4=Amasino RM | author5=Cox B | author6=Berceau T | display-authors=6 | last7=Powell | first7=T | last8=Cox | first8=MM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Steve===
{{main|Project Steve}}
The [[Discovery Institute]] announced that over 700 scientists had expressed support for [[intelligent design]] as of February 8, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/02/few_biologists.html (''Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition'', Panda's Thumb, February 21, 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213221402/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/02/few_biologists.html |date=December 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the [[National Center for Science Education]] to produce a "light-hearted" [[petition]] called "[[Project Steve]]" in support of [[evolution]]. Only scientists named "Steve" or some variation (such as Stephen, Stephanie, and Stefan) are eligible to sign the petition. It is intended to be a "tongue-in-cheek [[parody]]" of the lists of alleged "scientists" supposedly supporting [[creationist]] principles that creationist organizations produce.&lt;ref name=steve&gt;[http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve National Center for Science Education "Project Steve"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/#presentsci List of living scientists who accept the biblical account of creation] from [[Answers in Genesis]]&lt;/ref&gt; The petition demonstrates that there are more scientists who accept evolution with a name like "Steve" alone (over 1370&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/taking-action/list-steves The List of Steves]&lt;/ref&gt;) than there are in total who support intelligent design.

Many creationists act as [[Evangelism|evangelists]] and their organizations are registered as tax-free religious organizations.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion about some controversy about this, see [[Kent Hovind]].&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists have claimed that they represent the interests of true Christians, and evolution is associated only with [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, in his book [http://www.errantskeptics.org/Quotes_Regarding_Creation_Evolution.htm ''Systematic Theology''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224164219/http://www.errantskeptics.org/Quotes_Regarding_Creation_Evolution.htm |date=2007-02-24 }}, Charles Hodge, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co, 1975, vol. 2, p. 15, argues that "''First, it shocks the common sense of unsophisticated men to be told that the whale and the humming-bird, man and the mosquito, are derived from the same source... the system is thoroughly atheistic, and therefore cannot possibly stand.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/21soc03.htm#top ''Evolution and Christianity are opposites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021232820/http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/21soc03.htm |date=2006-10-21 }}, p. 36 of ''Evolution and Society'', Volume 2 of ''Scientific Facts Against Evolution-Origin of the Universe: 3 Volume Encyclopedia'' states, of evolution and Christianity, "''there can be no reconciliation between the two. One view stands for fighting, warfare against the supposed weaker ones, and atheism; the other is for peace, self-sacrifice for the good of others, and belief and trust in the Creator God...Even evolutionists and atheists have declared that their creeds are totally different than those of Christianity.''" Also in the article ''Evolution and the churches'' on pages 39-41 of the same volume, "''In spite of clear-cut statements by evolutionists that "evolution IS atheism," many denominations today accept one form or another of evolutionary theory.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all religious organizations find support for evolution incompatible with their religious faith. For example, 12 of the plaintiffs opposing the teaching of [[creation science]] in the influential ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' court case were clergy representing Methodist, Episcopal, African Methodist Episcopal, Catholic, Southern Baptist, Reform Jewish, and Presbyterian groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2243 McLean v Arkansas, Encyclopedia of Arkansas]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several religious organizations that have issued statements advocating the teaching of evolution in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion ''Defending the teaching of evolution in public education, Statements from Religious Organizations'']&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Dr. [[Rowan Williams]], issued statements in support of evolution in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/21/archbishop_backs_evolution/ ''Archbishop of Canterbury backs evolution: Well, he is a Primate,'' Chris Williams, The Register, Tuesday 21 March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]] is a signed statement by 12,808 (as of 28 May 2012) American Christian clergy of different denominations rejecting creationism organized in 2004. Molleen Matsumura of the [[National Center for Science Education]] found, of Americans in the twelve largest Christian denominations, at least 77% belong to churches that support evolution education (and that at one point, this figure was as high as 89.6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1998|p=9}} notes that, "''Table 1 demonstrates that Americans in the 12 largest Christian denominations, 89.6% belong to churches that support evolution education! Indeed, many of the statements in ''Voices'' insist quite strongly that evolution must be included in science education and "creation science" must be excluded. Even if we subtract the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], which has changed its view of evolution since [[McLean v Arkansas]] and might take a different position now, the percentage those in denominations supporting evolution is still a substantial 77%. Furthermore, many other Christian and non-Christian denominations, including the [[United Church of Christ]] and the National Sikh Center, have shown some degree of support for evolution education (as defined by inclusion in 'Voices' or the "Joint Statement").''" Matsumura produced her table from a June, 1998 article titled ''Believers: Dynamic Dozen'' put out by Religion News Services which in turn cites the ''1998 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''. Matsurmura's calculations include the [[Southern Baptist Convention|SBC]] based on a brief they filed in [[McLean v. Arkansas]], where the SBC took a position it has since changed, according to Matsurmura. See also {{harvnb|NCSE|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These religious groups include the [[Catholic Church]], as well as various denominations of Protestantism, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention, USA]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[National Baptist Convention of America]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/schrock/docs/Eagle-25.pdf ''Christianity, Evolution Not in Conflict'', John Richard Schrock, Wichita Eagle May 17, 2005 page 17A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921030214/http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/schrock/docs/Eagle-25.pdf |date=September 21, 2006 }}&lt;!-- This editorial mischaracterizes the Matsurmura|1998 article--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1998|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figure closer to about 71% is presented by the analysis of Walter B.

[[Michael Shermer]] argued in Scientific American in October 2006 that evolution supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes and the rule of law. Shermer also suggests that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052848/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=00068F43-E189-150E-A18983414B7F0000&amp;colID=13 ''Darwin on the Right: Why Christians and conservatives should accept evolution''], Michael Shermer, Scientific American, October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution and Ahmadiyya===
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya views of evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] Movement universally accepts evolution and actively promotes it. [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' that evolution did occur but only through [[God]] being the One who brings it about. It does not occur itself, according to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]. The Ahmadis do not believe [[Adam]] was the first human on earth, but merely the first prophet to receive a [[revelation]] of God.

===Evolution and the Baha'i Faith===
{{main article|Bahá'í Faith and science#Evolution}}
A fundamental part of `Abdul-Bahá's teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the [[Common descent|same origin]]: "the origin of all material life is one..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: "Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp= 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:

:"[T]he growth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The [[seed]] does not at once become a [[tree]]; the [[embryo]] does not at once become a man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1908|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}}

===Evolution and the Catholic Church===
The 1950 encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'' advocated scepticism towards evolution without explicitly rejecting it; this was substantially amended by Pope John-Paul II in 1996 in an address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in which he said, "Today, almost half a century after publication of the encyclical, new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, Speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, October 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2002 the [[International Theological Commission]] found that "Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth, while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html "Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621050711/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html |date=June 21, 2014 }}, [[International Theological Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was published by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on July 2004 by the authority of Cardinal Ratzinger (who became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) who was the president of the Commission at the time.

The [[Magisterium]] has not made an authoritative statement on intelligent design, and has permitted arguments on both sides of the issue. In 2005, Cardinal [[Christoph Schönborn]] of Vienna appeared to endorse intelligent design when he denounced philosophically materialist interpretations of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Heneghan. "Catholics and Evolution: Interview with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn", ''BeliefNet'', Jan. 5, 2006 [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/182/story_18220_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In an op-ed in the [[New York Times]] he said "Evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense - an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection - is not."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/opinion/07schonborn.html] Finding Design in Nature by Christoph Schönborn&lt;/ref&gt; This common line of reasoning among fundamentalist theologians is flawed, as evolution by natural selection is not random at all; only mutations occur in a stochastic manner, while natural selection establishes genes which aid survival in a particular environment.

In the January 16&amp;ndash;17 2006 edition of the official [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', [[University of Bologna]] evolutionary biology Professor [[Fiorenzo Facchini]] wrote an article agreeing with the judge's ruling in ''[[Kitzmiller v.

===Evolution and Hinduism===
{{Main article|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hindus believe in the concept of evolution of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msu.edu/~hernan94] Dave Hernandez - Michigan State University&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of [[Dashavatara]]&amp;mdash;different incarnations of God starting from simple organisms and progressively becoming complex beings&amp;mdash;and [[Religious views of evolution#Day and night of Brahma|Day and Night of Brahma]] are generally cited as instances of Hindu acceptance of evolution.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===US religious denominations that dispute evolution===
In the United States, many Protestant denominations promote creationism, preach against evolution, and sponsor lectures and debates on the subject. Denominations that explicitly advocate creationism instead of evolution or "Darwinism" include the [[Assemblies of God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|GCAG|1977}}, General Council of the Assemblies of Godofficial assertion of creationism&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} the [[Free Methodist Church]], [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barry|2001|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} [[Pentecostal Churches]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]es,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html Official Seventh-day Adventist belief statement advocating creationism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]], [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]], [[Southern Baptist Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=967 Southern Baptist Convention Resolution on Creationism]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oneness Pentecostal|Pentecostal Oneness churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.regis.edu/mghedott/evolut.htm Prof. Michael J.

==Support for evolution in medicine and industry==
A common complaint of [[creationist]]s is that evolution is of no value, has never been used for anything, and will never be of any use. According to many creationists, nothing would be lost by getting rid of evolution, and science and industry might even benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=252 | title = Evolution - Useful or Useless? | first = George | last = Lindsey | journal = Impact | volume = #148 |date=1985-10-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |format = asp | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/evolution.asp | title = Evolution and practical science | first = Carl | last = Wieland | journal = Creation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 4 |date=1999-09-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |format = asp | ref = harv |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104420/http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/evolution.asp |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/french.asp | title = French creation interview with French scientist Dr André Eggen | first = Ken | last = Ham | journal = Creation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 17–19 |date=1998-09-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 | format = asp | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, evolution is being put to practical use in industry and widely used on a daily basis by researchers in [[medicine]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], and [[genetics]] to both formulate hypotheses about biological systems for the purposes of experimental design, as well as to rationalise observed data and prepare applications.&lt;ref name=nihrecord/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, George |author2=Nesse, Randolph M. |title=Why we get sick: the new science of Darwinian medicine |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-679-74674-4 |oclc= |doi= |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=applications&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA215.html | title = Index to Creationist claims: Claim CA215 | work = [[TalkOrigins Archive]] | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |date=2005-10-04 | last = Isaak | first = Mark (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindell&gt;{{cite book |author=Mindell, David A. |title=The evolving world: evolution in everyday life |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |date=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-674-02191-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2017 there are 487,558 scientific papers in [[PubMed]] that mention 'evolution'.&lt;ref name=pubmed&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=evolution | title = NCBI PubMed | work = [[PubMed]] | accessdate = 2012-06-25 | date = 2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceutical companies utilize biological evolution in their development of new products, and also use these medicines to combat evolving bacteria and viruses.&lt;ref name=applications/&gt;

Because of the perceived value of evolution in applications, there have been some expressions of support for evolution on the part of [[corporations]]. In [[Kansas]], there has been some widespread concern in the corporate and academic communities that a move to weaken the teaching of evolution in schools will hurt the state's ability to recruit the best talent, particularly in the [[biotech]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/265482/do_scientists_see_kansas_missouri_as_antiscience | title = Do Scientists See Kansas, Missouri As 'Anti-Science'? | first = Jason | last = Gertzen |author2=Stafford, Diane  | work = The Kansas City Star |date=2005-10-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071117074042/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/265482/do_scientists_see_kansas_missouri_as_antiscience |archivedate = November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hanle of the [[Biotechnology Institute]] warned that the [[United States]] risks falling behind in the [[biotechnology]] race with other nations if it does not do a better job of teaching [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/29/AR2006092901628.html ''Waging War on Evolution,'' Paul A.

Furthermore, McCarter concluded that 47 of the last 50 Nobel Prizes in medicine or physiology depended on an understanding of evolutionary theory (according to McCarter's unspecified personal criteria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ncse.com/rncse/25/3-4/evolution-is-winner-breakthroughs-prizes | format = asp | title = Evolution is a Winner - for Breakthroughs and Prizes | first = James | last = McCarter | work = National Center for Science Education | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}; originally published in the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], 2005-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other support for evolution==
There are also many educational organizations that have issued statements in support of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/education List of educational organizations that support evolution and their statements about evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, creationist beliefs (or a lack of support for evolutionary theory) are relatively widespread, even garnering a majority of public opinion. A study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' compared attitudes about evolution in the United States, 32 European countries (including Turkey) and [[Japan]]. The only country where acceptance of evolution was lower than in the United States was [[Turkey]] (25%). Public acceptance of evolution was most widespread (at over 80% of the population) in [[Iceland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=ScienceSurvey&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |date=11 August 2006 |volume=313 |issue=5788 |pages=765&amp;ndash;766 |title=Public Acceptance of Evolution |author1=Jon D.

Among those who had heard of Charles Darwin and knew something about the theory of evolution, 77% of people in India agree that enough scientific evidence exists to support Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.&lt;ref name="ncse India"&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2009/07/opinions-evolution-from-ten-countries-004885 Opinions on evolution from ten countries] July 2nd, 2009, [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2009/07/darwin-and-unnatural-disbelief.html Darwin and unnatural disbelief] July 1, 2009. Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 85% of God believing Indians who know about evolution agree that life on earth evolved over time as a result of natural selection.&lt;ref name="ncse India"/&gt;

In a survey carried among 10 major nations, the highest proportion that agreed that evolutionary theories alone should be taught in schools was in India, at 49%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/8322781.stm Darwin teaching 'divides opinion'] [[BBC News]]; Monday, 26 October 2009.

Highest acceptence was found in Delhi, Maharashtra and Kerala (all above 78%) while the least was found to be in Haryana (41.3%). Males were marginally more likely to accept the evolution compared with females (72% vs. 69%), and non-religious people compared with religious people (74% vs. 67%). Surprisingly people who identified as ‘rightists’ accepted the evolution more than those who identified themselves as ‘leftists’ (66% vs. 61%) in political spectra. The study also identified teachers and students (over 73%) as most likely to accept evolution while employed adults (59%) least. While at the international level, the trend is quite clear that religiosity is inversely proportional to public acceptance of evolution, situation in India was strikingly opposite. Lead author, Dr. [[Felix Bast]] from [[Central University of Punjab]] conjectured possible reason for high public acceptance of evolution in India despite the fact of high religiosity is that Hinduism does not conflict Darwin’s theory of evolution to a large extent. According to [[2011 Census of India|2011 census]], Hindus encompass 80.3% of Indian population. Many concepts of Vedas and Hinduism support the scientific consensus of geology, climate science and evolution to a large extent. For example, according to Rigveda, the age of earth is 1.97 billion years, which is very old compared with that of creation myth propounded by Abrahamic religions (according to creationism-also called Intelligent Design, the age of earth is around 6000 years). Current scientific consensus of the age of earth is 4.543 billion years. A number of evolutionary biologists in the past as well were baffled about the surprising similarity between evolutionary theory and Hinduism. British evolutionary biologist JBS Haldane, for instance, suggested that Hindu concept of ''dashavatara''- the ten incarnations of lord Vishnu- is a rough idea of vertebrate evolution (fish-the vertebrate to tortoise-reptile to boar-mammal to man). Vedic concepts of ''pralaya'' and ''mahapralaya'' too surprisingly capture the cyclic nature of global climate (glacial-interglacial cycles).

=== United Kingdom ===
A 2006 UK poll on the "origin and development of life" asked participants to choose between three different explanations for the origin of life: 22% chose (Young Earth) [[Young Earth creationism|creationism]], 17% opted for [[intelligent design]] ("certain features of living things are best explained by the intervention of a supernatural being, e.g. God"), 48% selected [[evolution]] theory (with a divine role explicitly excluded) and the rest did not know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4648598.stm Britons unconvinced on evolution] BBC 26 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/262/BBC-Survey-On-The-Origins-Of-Life.aspx BBC Survey On The Origins Of Life] IPSOS-Mori&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 poll found that only 38% of Britons believe God played no role in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/poll-darwin-survey-shows-international-consensus-on-acceptance-of-evolution.pdf|title=Project Darwin Omnibus - Great Britain|last=|first=|date=April 2009|website=Ipsos|access-date=24 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305194947/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/poll-darwin-survey-shows-international-consensus-on-acceptance-of-evolution.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 poll, 69% of Britons believe that humans evolved from less advanced life forms, while 17% believe that God created human beings in their present forms within the last 10,000 years.&lt;ref name="Angus Reid Polls"/&gt;

===United States===
US courts have ruled in favor of teaching evolution in science classrooms, and against teaching creationism, in numerous cases such as [[Edwards v. Aguillard]], [[Hendren v. Campbell]], [[McLean v. Arkansas]] and [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]].

A prominent organization in the United States behind the [[intelligent design movement]] is the  Discovery Institute, which, through its [[Center for Science and Culture]], conducts a number of [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|public relations and lobbying campaigns]] aimed at influencing the public and policy makers in order to advance its position in [[academia]]. The [[Discovery Institute]] claims that because there is a significant lack of [[Argumentum ad populum|public support]] for evolution, that [[creation and evolution in public education|public schools]] should, as their campaign states, "[[Teach the Controversy]]", although there is no controversy over the validity of evolution within the scientific community.

The US has one of the highest levels of public belief in biblical or other religious accounts of the origins of life on earth among industrialized countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116213944/http://www.galluppoll.com/content/?CI=14107 ''Third of Americans Say Evidence Has Supported Darwin's Evolution Theory Almost half of Americans believe God created humans 10,000 years ago'' Frank Newport ] Result of 2004 Gallup poll showing about 45% of the US public believe in the biblical creation account, and only 1/3 believe in Darwinian theory.&lt;/ref&gt; However according to the PEW research center, 62 percent of adults in the [[United States]] accept human evolution and while 34 percent of adults believe that humans have always existed in their present form. The poll involved over 35,000 adults in the [[United States]]. However acceptance of evolution varies per state. For example the State of [[Vermont]] has the highest acceptance of evolution of any other State in the [[United States]]. 79% people in [[Vermont]] accept human evolution. [[Mississippi]] has the lowest acceptance of evolution of any other State in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/12/30/publics-views-on-human-evolution/ | title=Public's Views on Human Evolution &amp;#124; Pew Research Center| date=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] creationism survey found that 38% of adults in the United States inclined to the view that "God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years" when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which was noted as being at the lowest level in 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx | title=In U.S., Belief in Creationist View of Humans at New Low}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19% believed that "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process", despite 49% of respondents indicating they believed in evolution.

A 2005 Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of evangelical Christians believed that living organisms have not changed since their creation, but only 31% of Catholics and 32% of mainline Protestants shared this opinion. A 2005 Harris Poll&lt;ref name=Harrispoll&gt;[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 ''Nearly Two-thirds of U.S. Adults Believe Human Beings Were Created by God''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217080148/http://harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |date=2005-12-17 }}, The Harris Poll #52, July 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that 63% of liberals and 37% of conservatives agreed that humans and other primates have a common ancestry.&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt;

=== Uruguay ===
According to a 2014 poll produced by the Pew Research Center, 74% of people in Uruguay believe "humans and other living things evolved over time" while 20% believe they have "always existed in the present form."&lt;ref name="PewLatinAmerica" /&gt;

=== Venezuela ===
According to a 2014 poll by the Pew Research Center, 63% of people in Venezuela believe "humans and other living things evolved over time" while 33% believe they have "always existed in the present form."&lt;ref name="PewLatinAmerica" /&gt;

== Trends ==
The level of assent that evolution garners has changed with time. The trends in acceptance of evolution can be estimated.

===Early impact of Darwin's theory===
The level of support for evolution in different communities has varied with time. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory had convinced almost every naturalist within 20 years of its publication in 1858, and was making serious inroads with the public and the more liberal clergy. It had reached such extremes, that by 1880, one
American religious weekly publication estimated that "perhaps a quarter, perhaps a half of the educated ministers in our leading Evangelical denominations" felt "that the story of the creation and fall of man, told in Genesis, is no more the record of actual occurrences than is the parable of the Prodigal Son."&lt;ref name=Numbers&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070621033807/http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/NUMCRX_excerpt.pdf ''The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design, expanded edition'', Ronald L. Numbers, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England, 2006] {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, many of the most conservative Christians accepted an ancient earth, and life on earth before Eden. [[Victorian Era]] Creationists were more akin to people who subscribe to [[theistic evolution]] today. Even fervent anti-evolutionist [[Scopes Trial]] prosecutor [[William Jennings Bryan]] interpreted the "days" of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as ages of the earth, and acknowledged that biochemical evolution took place, drawing the line only at the story of [[Adam and Eve]]'s creation. Prominent pre-World War II creationist [[Harry Rimmer]] allowed an [[Old Earth Creationist|Old Earth]] by slipping millions of years into putative gaps in the Genesis account, and claimed that the [[Noachian Flood]] was only a local phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

In the decades of the 20th century, [[George McCready Price]] and a tiny group of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] followers were among the very few believers in a [[Young Earth Creationism|Young Earth]] and a worldwide flood, which Price championed in his "new catastrophism" theories. It was not until the publication of [[John C. Whitcomb, Jr.]], and [[Henry M. Morris]]’s book ''Genesis Flood'' in 1961 that Price's idea was revived. In the last few decades, many creationists have adopted Price's beliefs, becoming progressively more strict [[biblical literalists]].&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2015}}

===Recent public beliefs===
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
In a 1991 Gallup poll, 47% of the US population, and 25% of college graduates agreed with the statement, "God created man pretty much in his present form at one time within the last 10,000 years."

Fourteen years
later, in 2005, Gallup found that 53% of Americans expressed the belief that "God created human beings in their present form exactly the way the Bible describes it." About 2/3 (65.5%) of those surveyed thought that creationism was definitely or probably true. In 2005 a [[Newsweek]] poll discovered that 80 percent of the American public thought that "God created the universe." and the Pew Research Center reported that "nearly two-thirds of Americans say that creationism should be taught alongside evolution in public schools." [[Ronald Numbers]] commented on that with "Most surprising of all was the discovery that large numbers of high-school biology teachers — from 30% in Illinois and 38% in Ohio to a whopping 69% in Kentucky — supported the teaching of creationism."&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

The [[National Center for Science Education]] reports that from 1985 to 2005, the number of Americans unsure about evolution increased from 7% to 21%, while the number rejecting evolution declined from 48% to 39%.&lt;ref name=ScienceSurvey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hecht&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9786 Why doesn't America believe in evolution?, Jeff Hecht, New Scientist, 20 August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Miller of Michigan State University has found in his polls that the number of Americans who accept evolution has declined from 45% to 40% from 1985 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Science, vol 313, p 765&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of these somewhat contradictory results, it is difficult to know for sure what is happening to public opinion on evolution in the US. It does not appear that either side is making unequivocal progress. It does appear that uncertainty about the issue is increasing, however.

Anecdotal evidence is that creationism is becoming more of an issue in the UK as well. One report in 2006 was that UK students are increasingly arriving ill-prepared to participate in medical studies or other advanced education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1714171,00.html ''Academics fight rise of creationism at universities: More students believe Darwin got it wrong, Royal Society challenges "insidious problem"''], Duncan Campbell, The Guardian, Tuesday February 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent scientific trends===
The level of support for [[creationism]] among relevant scientists is minimal. In 2007 the [[Discovery Institute]] reported that about 600 scientists signed their ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism|A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism]]'' list, up from 100 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2732 | title = Ranks of Scientists Doubting Darwin's Theory on the Rise | author = Staff, [[Discovery Institute]] | publisher = [[Discovery Institute]] |date=2007-03-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual statement of the Scientific Dissent from Darwinism is a relatively mild one that expresses skepticism about the absoluteness of 'Darwinism' (and is in line with the [[falsifiability]] required of [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]]) to explain all features of life, and does not in any way represent an absolute denial or rejection of evolution.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ncse.com/creationism/general/doubting-darwinism-creative-license | title = Doubting Darwinism through Creative License | last = Evans | first = Skip | authorlink = Skip Evans | publisher = [[National Center for Science Education]] |date=2001-11-29 | accessdate = 2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a tongue-in-cheek response known as [[Project Steve]], a list restricted to scientists named Steve, Stephanie etc. who agree that evolution is "a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences," has 1,382 signatories {{As of|2015|11|24|alt=as of November 24, 2015}}.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve |title=Project Steve  |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with these names make up approximately 1% of the total U.S. population.

The United States [[National Science Foundation]] statistics on US yearly science graduates demonstrate that from 1987 to 2001, the number of biological science graduates increased by 59% while the number of geological science graduates decreased by 20.5%. However, the number of geology graduates in 2001 was only 5.4% of the number of graduates in the biological sciences, while it was 10.7% of the number of biological science graduates in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf04311/pdf/tab42.pdf | title = NSF statistics on science graduates 1966&amp;ndash;2001 | publisher = National Science Foundation | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061109070632/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf04311/pdf/tab42.pdf | archivedate = 2006-11-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Science Resources Statistics Division of the National Science Foundation estimated that in 1999, there were 955,300 biological scientists in the US (about 1/3 of who hold graduate degrees). There were also 152,800 earth scientists in the US as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://srsstats.sbe.nsf.gov/preformatted-tables/1999/tables/TableC1.pdf | title = 1999 SESTAT (Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data) Table C-1 | publisher = National Science Foundation/Science Resources Statistics Division | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929135233/http://srsstats.sbe.nsf.gov/preformatted-tables/1999/tables/TableC1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large fraction of the Darwin Dissenters have specialties unrelated to research on evolution; of the dissenters, three-quarters are not biologists.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/sciencespecial2/21peti.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title = Few Biologists But Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition | first = Kenneth | last = Chang | publisher = The [[New York Times]] |date=2006-03-21 | format = php }}; text available without registering at {{cite web | url = http://www.ntskeptics.org/news/news2006-02-25.htm | title = Skeptical News }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2006, the dissenter list was expanded to include non-US scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/06/dissent_from_darwinism_goes_gl.html | last = Crowther | first = Robert | publisher = [[Discovery Institute]] | title = Dissent From Darwinism 'Goes Global' as Over 600 Scientists Around the World Express Their Doubts About Darwinian Evolution | accessdate = 2007-10-30 |date=2006-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers are attempting to understand the factors that affect people's acceptance of evolution. Studies have yielded inconsistent results, explains associate professor of education at Ohio State University, David Haury. He recently performed a study that found people are likely to reject evolution if they have feelings of uncertainty, regardless of how well they understand evolutionary theory. Haury believes that teachers need to show students that their intuitive feelings may be misleading (for example, using the [[Wason selection task]]), and thus to exercise caution when relying on them as they judge the rational merits of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/tea.20449 | volume=49 | issue=1 | title=Feeling of certainty: Uncovering a missing link between knowledge and acceptance of evolution | year=2011 | journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching | pages=95–121 | last1 = Ha | first1 = Minsu| bibcode=2012JRScT..49...95H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/human/intuition-belief-evolution-120122.html Discovery News, "Belief in Evolution Boils Down to a Gut Feeling", Sun Jan 22, 2012 09:24 AM ET.

[[File:Das Jüngste Gericht (Memling).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[The Last Judgment (Memling)|The Last Judgment]]'' by painter [[Hans Memling]]. In Christian belief, the [[Last Judgement]] is an apocalyptic event where God makes a final judgement of all people on Earth.|alt=A three paneled colour painting. The centre panel shows Jesus sitting in judgment on the world, while St Michael is weighing souls.

Predictions of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic events]] that would result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of humanity]], a [[Global catastrophic risk|collapse of civilization]], or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the beginning of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref name=zygon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole-Turner |first=Ronald |date=2012 |title=The singularity and the rapture: Transhumanist and popular Christian views of the future |journal=[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=777–796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most predictions are related to [[Abrahamic religions]], often standing for or similar to the [[eschatological]] events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the [[Rapture]], [[Great Tribulation]], [[Last Judgment]], and the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. End-time events are usually predicted to occur within the lifetime of the person making the prediction, and are usually made using the Bible, and in particular the [[New Testament]], as either the primary or exclusive source for the predictions.&lt;ref name=zygon/&gt; Often this takes the form of mathematical calculations, such as trying to calculate the point where it will have been [[Year 6000|6000 years]] since the supposed creation of the Earth by the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]],{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=7}} which according to the [[Talmud]] marks the deadline for the [[Messiah]] to appear.&lt;ref name=six/&gt; Predictions of the end from [[natural disaster|natural events]] have also been theorised by various scientists and scientific groups. While these predictions are generally accepted as plausible within the scientific community, the events and phenomena are not expected to occur for hundreds of thousands or even billions of years from now.

Little research has been done into why people make apocalyptic predictions.&lt;ref name=few/&gt; Historically, it has been done for reasons such as diverting attention from actual crises like poverty and war, pushing political agendas, and promoting hatred of certain groups; [[antisemitism]] was a popular theme of Christian apocalyptic predictions in medieval times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-have-always-been-obsessed-end-world-180956525/ |title=People Have Always Been Obsessed with the End of the World |last=Fessensden |first=Marissa |date=September 8, 2015 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425054533/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-have-always-been-obsessed-end-world-180956525/ |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while French and [[Lutheran]] depictions of the apocalypse were known to feature English and Catholic antagonists respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/apocalypse-now-our-incessant-desire-to-picture-the-end-of-the-world-46104 |title=Apocalypse now: our incessant desire to picture the end of the world |last= |first= |date=August 25, 2015 |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180516234124/https://theconversation.com/apocalypse-now-our-incessant-desire-to-picture-the-end-of-the-world-46104 |archivedate=May 16, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologists, possible explanations for why people believe in modern apocalyptic predictions include mentally reducing the actual danger in the world to a single and definable source, an innate human fascination with fear, personality traits of paranoia and powerlessness and a modern romanticism involved with end-times due to its portrayal in contemporary fiction.&lt;ref name=few&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/psychology-reveals-the-comforts-of-the-apocalypse/ |title=Psychology Reveals the Comforts of the Apocalypse |last=Yuhas |first=Daisy |date=December 18, 2012 |work=[[Scientific American]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425053659/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/psychology-reveals-the-comforts-of-the-apocalypse/ |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/doomsday-postpone-again-heres-why-were-obsessed-end-world-according-psychology-670860 |title=Doomsday Is Postponed Again: Here's Why We’re All So Obsessed With The End Of World, According to Psychology |last=Dovey |first=Dana |date=September 26, 2017 |work=[[Newsweek]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425053733/http://www.newsweek.com/doomsday-postpone-again-heres-why-were-obsessed-end-world-according-psychology-670860 |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of Abrahamic religions throughout modern history is said to have created a culture which encourages the embracement of a future that will be drastically different from the present.&lt;ref name=zygon/&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=xii}} Such a culture is credited with the rise in popularity of predictions that are more secular in nature, such as the [[2012 phenomenon]], while maintaining the centuries-old theme that a powerful force will bring the end of humanity.{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=xii}}

Polls conducted in 2012 across 20 countries found over 14% of people believe the world will end in their lifetime, with percentages ranging from 6% of people in France to 22% in the US and Turkey.

|This American pastor bases his prediction on the prior suggestion that Jesus would return in 1988, i.e., within one biblical generation (40 years) of the founding of Israel in 1948. Beshore argues that the prediction was correct, but that the definition of a biblical generation was incorrect and was actually 70–80 years, placing the second coming of Jesus between 2018 and 2028 and the rapture by 2021 at the latest.

| In approximately 300,000 years, [[WR 104]], a [[triple star]], is expected to explode in a [[supernova]]. It has been suggested that it may produce a [[gamma ray burst]] that could pose a threat to life on Earth should its poles be aligned 12° or lower towards Earth. However spectroscopic observations now strongly suggest that it is tilted at an angle of 30°-40° and so any gamma ray burst should not hit Earth.

| The [[Sun]]'s increasing brightness causes the rate of [[weathering]] of the planet's [[crust (geology)|crust]] to increase. This will cause the level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]] to drop dramatically, making [[photosynthesis]] in [[plants]] impossible. This will very likely cause a mega [[mass extinction]] of the Earth's [[vegetation]]. The lack of [[oxygen]]-producing plants will cause [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to disappear as well as the [[ozone layer]], making [[animal]] life impossible. Even if photosynthesis was still possible, rising surface tempatures from the brighter sun will make complex life (plants and animals) impossible.

This is a '''list of [[invasive species]] in [[North America]]'''. A species is regarded as invasive if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a [[native species]]), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a pest in the new location, directly threatening human industry, such as agriculture, or the local [[biodiversity]].

The term ''invasive species'' refers to a subset of those species defined as [[introduced species]]. If a species has been introduced, but remains local, and is not problematic for human industry or the local biodiversity, then it is not considered invasive, and does not belong on this list.

'''Metal clay''' is a [[crafting|crafting medium]] consisting of very small particles of metal such as [[silver]], [[gold]], bronze, or [[copper]] mixed with an [[organic binder]] and water for use in making [[jewelry]], [[bead]]s and small sculptures. Originating in Japan in 1990, metal clay can be shaped just like any [[Modelling clay|soft clay]], by hand or using molds. After drying, the clay can be fired in a variety of ways such as in a [[kiln]], with a handheld gas torch, or on a gas stove, depending on the type of clay and the metal in it.  The binder burns away, leaving the pure [[sintering|sintered]] metal. Shrinkage of between 8% and 30% occurs (depending on the product used). Alloys such as [[bronze]], [[sterling silver]], and [[steel]] also are available.

==History==
Metal clay first came out in Japan in 1990&lt;ref name="Morikawa patent"&gt;{{US patent|5328775}} citing May 18, 1990 (19900518) [JP] Japan 2- 128447.&lt;/ref&gt; to allow craft jewelry makers to make sophisticated looking jewelry without the years of study needed to make fine jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Musante|first=Lynda S. |oclc=410210887 |author2=Maria Nerius |date=2000  |title=Jewelry making for fun &amp; profit: Make money doing what you love! |publisher=[[Random House|Random House Digital, Inc.]] |location= |isbn=0-7615-2044-9 |page=ii-iii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5dmsKNFOKYC&amp;pg=PT5 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silver metal clay==

Fine silver metal clay results in objects containing 99.9% pure silver, which is suitable for enameling. Lump metal clay is sold in sealed packets to keep it moist and workable. The silver versions are also available as a softer paste in a pre-filled syringe which can be used to produce extruded forms, in small jars of slip and as paper-like sheets, from which most of the moisture has been removed. Common brands of silver metal clay include Precious Metal Clay (PMC) and Art Clay Silver (ACS).

Metal clay artists looking for more strength in their silver creations can also mix PMC fine silver clay with an equal part of PMC Sterling clay.&lt;ref&gt;960: An alloy of sterling PMC |url=http://celiefagojewelry.blogspot.com/2014/02/960-new-alloy-of-sterling-pmc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The firing of this alloy is found to be up to {{convert|898|°C}} for two hours.

Another available alloy, EZ960 Sterling Silver Metal Clay was invented by Bill Struve from Metal Adventures, the inventor of BRONZclay™ and COPPRclay™. Because the clay is a sterling silver alloy, one of its best attributes is its post firing strength, in comparison to fine silver. This clay is fired open shelf on a raised hard ceramic kiln shelf at {{convert|913|°C}} for 2 hours, full ramp. No carbon required. Its shrinkage rate is smaller than other clays, at 10–11%.

===Precious Metal Clay (PMC)===
PMC was developed in the early 1990s in Japan by [[metallurgist]] Masaki Morikawa.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Precious Metal Clay by Mary Ann Devos (C)2003 published by Wardell Publications Inc {{ISBN|0-919985-36-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[solid phase|solid-phase]] [[sintered]] product of a [[Powder metallurgy|precious metal powder]] used to form a precious metal article,&lt;ref name="Morikawa patent"/&gt; the material consists of microscopic particles of pure silver or fine gold and a water-soluble, non-toxic, organic binder that burns off during firing. Success was first achieved with gold and later duplicated with silver. 
The PMC brand includes the following products:
* The original formula of PMC, now called "standard": fired at {{convert|900|°C|°F}} for 2 hours, shrinks by 30% during firing.
* PMC+ &amp; PMCflex: fired at {{convert|900|°C|°F}} for 10 minutes or {{convert|800|°C|°F}} for 30 minutes; shrinks 15%, due to a particle size reduction. PMC+ is also available in sheet form which can be worked like paper; for example, for [[origami]].
* PMC3: fired at {{convert|599|°C|°F}} for 45 minutes or {{convert|699|°C|°F}} for 10 minutes; shrinks by 10%. It can also be fired using a [[butane torch]] by heating it to [[Thermal radiation#Properties|orange heat]] for at least 2 minutes. It has a longer working life than the older formulations. It is also available in slip and paste forms which can be painted onto the surface of an object to be used as a mold.
* Aura 22: a 22-[[Carat (purity)|carat]] [[gilding]] material, a gold paste intended to be painted onto the surface of silver PMC pieces, or ready-made silver objects.&lt;ref&gt;McCreight, Tim. "What's New?" ''Metalsmith'' Spring 2006, Vol. 26 Issue 1, p42-45, 4p&lt;/ref&gt;
* PMC Pro: a harder product which is only 0.900 fineness silver, hence it cannot be [[Silver hallmarks|hallmarked]] as [[sterling silver]]. It also requires kiln firing in a tub of [[activated carbon]] for 1 hour at {{convert|760|°C|°F}}.
* PMC Sterling: is fired at {{convert|815|°C}} and shrinks by 10–20%. Because of the copper content in this formula, firing is a two-step process; step one is an open-shelf firing and step two requires a firing pan with activated carbon media.

===Art Clay Silver (ACS)===
ACS was developed by AIDA Chemical Industries, also a Japanese company. ACS followed PMC Standard with their Art Clay Original clay (more like PMC+ than PMC Standard), which allows the user to fire with a handheld torch or on a gas hob. Owing to subtle differences in the binder and suggested firing times, this clay shrinks less than the PMC versions, approximately 8–10%.

Further developments introduced the Art Clay Slow Dry, a clay with a longer working time. Art Clay 650 and Art Clay 650 Slow Dry soon followed; both clays can be fired at {{convert|650|°C|°F}}, allowing the user to combine the clay with glass and sterling silver, which are affected negatively by the higher temperatures needed to fire the first generation clays. AIDA also manufacturers Oil Paste, a product used only on fired metal clay or milled fine silver, and Overlay Paste, which is designed for drawing designs on glass and porcelain.

In 2006 AIDA introduced the Art Clay Gold Paste, a more economical way to work with gold. The paste is painted onto the fired silver clay, then refired in a kiln, or with a torch or gas stove. When fired, it bonds with the silver, giving a 22-carat gold accent. The same year also saw Art Clay Slow Tarnish introduced, a clay that tarnishes less rapidly than the other metal clays.

==Base metal clays==
Lump metal clay in bronze was introduced in 2008 by Metal Adventures Inc. and in 2009 by Prometheus. Lump metal clays in copper were introduced in 2009 by Metal Adventures Inc. and Aida. Because of the lower cost, the bronze and copper metal clays are used by artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | journal = Metal Clay Artist Magazine
 | pages = 7
 | volume = 1
 | issue = 3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; more often than the gold and silver metal clays in the American market place. The actual creation time of a bronze or copper piece is also far greater than that of its silver counterpart.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Base metal clays, such as bronze, copper, and steel metal clays are best fired in the absence of oxygen to eliminate the oxidation of the metal by atmospheric oxygen. A means to accomplish this –- to place the pieces in activated carbon inside a container – was developed by Bill Struve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | date = July 2008
 | journal = Art Jewelry
 | pages = 30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powders==
Metal clays are also available as dry powders to which water is added to hydrate and kneaded to attain a clay consistency.  One advantage to the powders are their unlimited shelf life. The first silver clay in powder form was released in 2006 as Silver Smiths' Metal Clay Powder.&lt;ref&gt;MCPsilver999 | url=http://www.metalclaypowder.com |&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years base metal clays by Hadar Jacobson and Goldie World released several variation containing copper, brass, and even steel.

A '''molecule''' is an [[electrically]] neutral group of two or more [[atom]]s held together by [[chemical bond]]s.&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;{{GoldBookRef| title=Molecule|file=M04002|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Ebbin, Darrell D.| title= General Chemistry |edition=3rd| date= 1990| publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Co.]]| location= Boston| isbn= 0-395-43302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Brown, T.L. |author2=Kenneth C.

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.
{{clear}}

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covalent ===
{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last= Campbell| first= Neil A.| title= Biology: Exploring Life| url= http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate= 2012-02-05| year= 2006| publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]| location= Boston, Massachusetts| isbn= 0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

== Molecular geometry ==
{{Main|Molecular geometry}}

[[File:Cyanostar STM.png|thumb|left|upright|Structure and [[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] image of a "cyanostar" [[dendrimer]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C4CC03725A|pmid=25080328|title=Anion-induced dimerization of 5-fold symmetric cyanostars in 3D crystalline solids and 2D self-assembled crystals|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=50|issue=69|pages=9827–30|year=2014|last1=Hirsch|first1=Brandon E.|last2=Lee|first2=Semin|last3=Qiao|first3=Bo|last4=Chen|first4=Chun-Hsing|last5=McDonald|first5=Kevin P.|last6=Tait|first6=Steven L.|last7=Flood|first7=Amar H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

== Molecular spectroscopy ==
{{Main|Spectroscopy}}

[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [[single-molecule electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850|pmc=4322354|title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|page=8350|year=2015|bibcode= 2015NatSR...5E8350Z|author1=Zoldan|first1=V. C.|last2=Faccio|first2=R|last3=Pasa|first3=A. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 4546 (2001)] |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=9886–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15268005 |doi=10.1063/1.1704638 |bibcode= 2004JChPh.120.9886A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amatciems July 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Amatciems, a settlement of [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasians]] in [[Drabeši Parish]], [[Latvia]]. Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11876">'''Nature writing''' is [[nonfiction]] or [[fiction]] [[prose]] or [[poetry]] about the natural environment. Nature writing encompasses a wide variety of works, ranging from those that place primary emphasis on natural history facts (such as field guides) to those in which philosophical interpretation predominate. It includes [[natural history]] essays, poetry, essays of solitude or escape, as well as travel and adventure writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Lyon|first=Thomas Jefferson|publisher=Milkweed Editions|date=2001|title=This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing|ISBN=978-1571312563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nature writing often draws heavily on scientific information and facts about the natural world; at the same time, it is frequently written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and incorporates personal observations of and philosophical reflections upon nature.

Modern nature writing traces its roots to the works of [[natural history]] that were popular in the second half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th. An important early figures was the "[[parson-naturalist]]" [[Gilbert White]] (1720 – 1793),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1903|title=English Literature: From Milton to Johnson|chapter="Gilbert White"|location=London|publisher=William Heinemann|pages=375–378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUAOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA375}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneering [[England|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Ornithology|ornithologist]]. He is best known for his ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' (1789).

[[William Bartram]] (1739 – 1823) is a significant early American pioneer naturalist who first work was published in 1791.

==Pioneers==
Gilbert White is regarded by many as [[England]]'s first [[ecologist]], and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, D.L., Heinsohn, R.G. and Lindenmayer, D.B. 2005. Ecology. pp. 97-112 in R.Q. Grafton, L. Robin and R.J. Wasson (eds.), ''Understanding the Environment: Bridging the Disciplinary Divides''. Sydney, NSW: University of New South Wales Press, (p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the [[earthworm]]: "Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z_YVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 Letter LXVII] (1777)&lt;/ref&gt; White and [[William Markwick]] collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] between 1768 and 1793, which was summarised in ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'', as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern [[phenology]].

The tradition of [[Parson-naturalist|clerical naturalists]] predates White and can be traced back to some monastic writings of the Middle Ages, although some argue that their writings about animals and plants cannot be correctly classified as natural history. Notable early parson-naturalists were William Turner (1508–1568), John Ray (1627–1705), William Derham (1657–1735).

William Bertram, in 1773, embarked on a four year journey through eight southern American colonies. Bartram made many drawings and took notes on the native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|native American Indians]]. In [[Timeline of Florida History|1774]], he explored the St. Johns River.&lt;ref&gt;Bartram, William. ''The Travels of William Bartram, Naturalist Edition''. Edited with Commentary and an Annotated Index by Francis Harper. University of Georgia Press, Athens, 1998,  p118&lt;/ref&gt; William Bartram wrote of his experiences exploring the Southeast in his book known today as ''[[Bartram's Travels]]'', published in 1791. [[Ephraim George Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis]], in their book, ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'', name Bartram as "the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical forests of Florida."&lt;ref name=Squier&gt;{{cite book|last=Squier|first=E.G.|title=Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley|year=1848|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Washington, D.C.|page=46|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gilbert White and William Bertram, other significant writers include American [[ornithologist]] [[John James Audubon]] (1785 – 1851), [[Charles Darwin]]( (1809 – 1882),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1906|title=English Literature: From the Age of Johnson to the Age of Tennyson|chapter=CHARLES DARWIN|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan Co|pages=298–302|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zn3gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Jefferies]] (1848 – 1887), [[Susan Fenimore Cooper]] (1813 – 1894), mother of American nature writting, and [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817 – 1862), who is often considered the father of modern American nature writing, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803 – 1882) [[John Burroughs]], [[John Muir]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Rachel Carson]], [[M. Krishnan]], and [[Edward Abbey]] (although he rejected the term for himself).

Another important early work is ''[[A History of British Birds]]''  by [[Thomas Bewick]], published in two volumes. Volume 1, "Land Birds", appeared in 1797. Volume 2, "Water Birds", appeared in 1804.  The book was effectively the first "[[field guide]]" for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Critics note Bewick's skill as a [[naturalist]] as well as an engraver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/thomas-bewick-the-complete-illustrative-work-by-nigel-tattersfield/|title=Thomas Bewick: the complete illustrative work, by Nigel Tattersfield - British Birds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Europe==
Some important contemporary figures in Britain include [[Richard Mabey]], [[Roger Deakin]], [[Mark Cocker]], and [[Oliver Rackham]]. Rackham's books included ''Ancient Woodland'' (1980) and ''The History of the Countryside'' (1986). Richard Maybey has been involved with radio and television programmes on nature, and his book ''Nature Cure'', describes his experiences and recovery from depression in the context of man’s relationship with landscape and nature. He has also edited and introduced editions of Richard Jefferies, Gilbert White, [[Flora Thompson]] and [[Peter Matthiessen]]. Mark Crocker has written extensively for British newspapers and magazines and his books include [[Birds Britannica]] (with Richard Mabey) (2005). and ''Crow Country'' (2007). He frequently writes about modern responses to the wild, whether found in landscape, human societies or in other species. Roger Deakin was an English writer, documentary-maker and environmentalist. In 1999, Deakin's acclaimed book ''Waterlog'' was published.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/08/archive-environmentalist-roger-deakin-university?INTCMP=SRCH|title= Archives of environmentalist Roger Deakin given to university|date= 8 May 2010|publisher=Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the short story ''[[The Swimmer (short story)|The Swimmer]]'' by [[John Cheever]],&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently made into [[The Swimmer (1968 film)|a film]] starring [[Burt Lancaster]].&lt;/ref&gt; it describes his experiences of '[[Open water swimming|wild swimming]]' in Britain's rivers and lakes and advocates [[Freedom to roam|open access]] to the countryside and waterways.  Deakin's book ''Wildwood'' appeared posthumously in 2007. It describes a series of journeys across the globe that Deakin made to meet people whose lives are intimately connected to trees and wood.

In 2017 the German book publishing company [[Matthes &amp; Seitz Berlin]] started to grant the [[Deutscher Preis für Nature Writing|German Award for Nature Writing]], an annual literary award for writers in German language that excellently fulfil the criteria of the literary genre. It comes with a price money of 10.000 Euro and additionallly an [[artist in residency]] grant of six weeks at the International Academy for Nature Conservation of Germany on the German island [[Vilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-preis_fuer_nature_writing_2018.1492164.html |title= Preis für Nature Writing 2018: Sabine Scho und Christian Lehnert ausgezeichnet |date=2018-07-13 |website=boersenblatt.net |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Council]] in 2018 is offering an education bursary and workshops to six young German authors dedicated to Nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishcouncil.de/uk-germany-2018/writers-nature-stipendium |title=Writers by Nature: Stipendium |date=2018 |website=britishcouncil.de |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to evolution:
[[File:CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg|thumb|400px|right|A diagram showing the relationships betweens various groups of organisms]]
'''[[Evolution]]''' – change in [[heritable trait]]s of [[Organisms|biological organisms]] over generations due to [[natural selection]], [[mutation]], [[gene flow]], and [[genetic drift]].  Also known as '''descent with modification'''. Over time these evolutionary processes lead to formation of new species ([[speciation]]), changes within lineages ([[anagenesis]]), and loss of species ([[extinction]]). "Evolution" is also another name for [[evolutionary biology]], the subfield of [[biology]] concerned with studying [[Evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[diversity of life]] on Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7924">'''Phylogenetic inertia''' or phylogenetic constraint refers to the limitations on the future [[evolution]]ary pathways that have been imposed by previous [[adaptation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=K|last2=McKinney|first2=F|last3=Sorenson|first3=M|date=1999|title=Phylogenetic constraint on male parental care in the dabbling ducks.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=266|pages=759–763|doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0702|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] first recognized this phenomenon, though the term was later coined by Huber in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber|first=B|date=1939|title=Siebrohrensystem unserer Baume und seine jahreszeitlichen Veranderungen.|url=|journal=Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik|volume=88|pages=176–242|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin explained the idea of phylogenetic inertia based on his observations; he spoke about it when explaining the "Law of Conditions of Existence".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Darwin also suggested that, after [[speciation]], the [[organism]]s do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanahan|first=Timothy|date=2011|title=Phylogenetic Inertia and Darwin's Higher Law|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49816525_Phylogenetic_Inertia_and_Darwin%27s_Higher_Law|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main concept of phylogenetic inertia.

[[Richard Dawkins]] also explained these constraints by likening [[natural selection]] to a river in his 1982 book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: The Gene as a Unit of Selection|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of phylogenetic inertia ==

=== Body plan ===

*[[File:Fishapod evolution.jpg|alt=Sown here is a cladogram of the best known transitional fossils. From bottom to top: Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Tiktaalik, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Pederpes.|thumb|229x229px|Evolution of fish to tetrapods.  The basic body plan has been phylogenetically constrained.]]Most terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s have a [[body plan]] that consist of four limbs. The phylogenetic inertia hypothesis suggests that this body plan is observed, not because it happens to be optimal, but because [[Evolution of tetrapods|tetrapods]] are derived from a [[clade]] of [[fish]]es ([[Sarcopterygii]]) which also have four limbs. Four limbs happened to be suitable means of locomotion, and so this body plan has not been selected against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=Roger|date=1980|title=Evolutionary Theory Under Fire|url=|journal=Science|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Human]]s do not have optimal structure for [[bipedalism]], because much of the human body plan originally evolved under [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] locomotion, and has since been constrained because of phylogenetic inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gould|first=S. J.|last2=Lewontin|first2=R. C.|date=1979-09-21|title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=205|issue=1161|pages=581–598|doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086|issn=0962-8452|pmid=42062|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..581G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modes of reproduction ===

[[Bird]]s are the only speciose group of vertebrates that are exclusively [[Oviparity|oviparous]], or egg laying. It has been suggested that birds are phylogenetically constrained, as being derived from [[reptile]]s, and likely have not overcome this constraint or diverged far enough away to develop [[viviparity]], or live birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKitrick|first=Mary|date=1993|title=Phylogenetic Constraint in Evolutionary Theory: Has it any Explanatory Power?|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.24.110193.001515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Daniel|last2=Evans|first2=Howard|date=1986|title=Why are there no Viviparous Birds?|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=128|issue=2|doi=10.1086/284552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous structures ===

* More specifically than the similarity in body plan, there are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] bones across [[mammal]]ian taxa. For example, the [[pentadactyl limb]] bone structure observed in the arms of [[primate]]s, front legs of equestrians, in the wings of [[bat]]s, and the flippers of [[Seal (animal)|seals]]. The fact that they are homologous is further evidence for phylogenetic inertia; these structures have been modified over time, but they are constrained by common ancestry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Origin of Species|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1859|isbn=|location=|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Homology vertebrates-en.svg|thumb|Homologous bone structure in forelimbs of four vertebrates.|159x159px]]

It was called Phylogenetic [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|Eigenvector]] Regression (PVR), which runs [[Principal component analysis|principal component analyses]] between species on a pairwise [[Distance matrices in phylogeny|phylogenetic distance matrix]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In another, different study, the authors described methods for measuring phylogenetic inertia, looked at effectiveness of various comparative methods, and found that different methods can reveal different aspects of drivers. [[Autoregression]] and PVR showed good results with morphological traits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A '''prodromus''' ('forerunner' or 'precursor') aka '''prodrome''' is a term used in the [[natural sciences]] to describe a preliminary publication intended as the basis for a later, more comprehensive work.

It is also a medical term used for a [[premonitory]] symptom, that is, a symptom indicating the onset of a disease.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'', published 1913 by C. &amp; G. Merriam Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers'' (2007, Saunders)&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the word is from the 19th century: via French from New Latin prodromus, from Greek prodromos forerunner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Dictionary|title=Collins Dictionary|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/prodrome|website=http://www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable prodromi were ''[[Prodromus Entomology]]'', ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]'', ''[[Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis]]'' and [[Nicolas Steno]]'s ''De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus'', one of the early treatises attempting to explain the occurrence of fossils in solid rock.

'''Rubble''' is broken [[rock (geology)|stone]], of irregular size, shape&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rubble |volume=23 |page=804}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texture; undressed especially as a filling-in. Rubble naturally found in the soil is known also as ''''brash'''' (compare [[cornbrash]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Rubble" def. 2., "Brash n. 2. def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Where present, it becomes more noticeable when the land is ploughed or worked.

==Building==
[[Image:Wyggestons Chantry House, rubblework.jpg|thumb|Rubble-work on [[Newarke Houses Museum|Wyggeston's Chantry House]] in [[Leicester]], built c. 1511]]

"[[Rubble-work]]" is a name applied to several types of [[masonry]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; One kind, where the stones are loosely thrown together in a wall between boards and [[grout]]ed with [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] almost like [[concrete]], is called in [[Italian language|Italian]] "muraglia di getto" and in [[French language|French]] "bocage".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In Pakistan, walls made of rubble and concrete, cast in a formwork, are called 'situ', which probably derives from Sanskrit (similar to the Latin 'in situ' meaning 'made on the spot').

Work executed with more or less large stones put together without any attempt at [[Course (architecture)|courses]] is called rubble&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; walling. Where similar work is laid in courses, it is known as coursed rubble. [[Dry-stone wall]]ing is somewhat similar work done without the use of mortar. It is bound together by the fit of the stones and the regular placement of stones which extend through the thickness of the wall. A rubble wall built with mortar will be stronger if assembled in this way.

===Rubble walls in Malta===
[[File:Ta' Dmejrek-IMG 1500.jpg|thumb|Rubble wall near [[Dingli]], [[Malta]]]]

Rubble walls ({{lang-mt|ħitan tas-sejjieħ}}) are found all over the island of [[Malta]]. Similar walls are also frequently found in Sicily and the Arab countries. The various shapes and sizes of the stones used to build these walls look like stones that were found in the area lying on the ground or in the soil.  It is most probable that the practice of building these walls around the field was inspired by the Arabs during their rule in Malta, as in Sicily who were also ruled by the Arabs around the same period. The Maltese farmer found that the technique of these walls was very useful especially during an era where resources were limited. Rubble walls are used to serve as borders between the property of one farm from the other. A great advantage that  rubble walls offered is that when heavy rain falls, their structure would allow excessive water to pass through and therefore, excess water will not ruin the products. Soil erosion is minimised as the wall structure allows the water to pass through but it traps the soil and prevents it from being carried away from the field. One can see many rubble walls on the side of the hills and in valleys where the land slopes down and consequently the soil is in greater danger of being carried away.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10788">The '''self-sealing suction cup''' is a [[suction cup]] that exerts a suction force only when it is in physical contact with an object. Unlike most other suction cups, it does not exert any [[suction]] force when it is not in contact with an object.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=May 2010|title=Design, fabrication, and implementation of self-sealing suction cup arrays for grasping|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5509818/|journal=2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation|volume=|pages=|via=IEEE Xplore Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its grasping ability is achieved entirely through passive means without the use of sensors, valves, or actuators.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=November 2011|title=A Self-Sealing Suction Cup Array for Grasping|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265068249_A_Self-Sealing_Suction_Cup_Array_for_Grasping|journal=Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics|volume=3|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1115/1.4004893|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed so that, when used as part of a suction cup array, the suction cups that don’t come in contact with the object remain sealed. By having only the suction cups that are in direct contact of the object to exhibit suction force, the researchers were able to minimize leak points where air could enter and increase the pressure that each active cup receives, maximizing the suction force.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/3-d-printed-octopus-suckers-help-robots-stick/|title=3-D Printed Octopus Suckers Help Robots Stick|last=Harmon|first=Katherine|date=February 21, 2013|work=Scientific American|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an array of self-sealing suction cups can grasp and pick up a wide range of object sizes and shapes. This comes in contrast to conventional suction cups that are typically designed for one specific object size and geometry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, suction cups of various sizes have been manufactured, ranging from the palm of a hand to the point of a fingertip.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designnews.com/automation-motion-control/army-uses-3d-printed-tentacles-help-robots-manipulate-objects/139141260531080|title=Army Uses 3D-Printed Tentacles to Help Robots Manipulate Objects|last=Montalbano|first=Elizabeth|date=March 25, 2013|work=Design News|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-sealing suction cup was first developed in 2010 by a collaboration of researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]], the [[Edgewood Chemical Biological Center]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the University of Maryland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Design ==
The design of the self-sealing suction cup was initially inspired by the [[Sucker (zoology)|suckers]] of the octopus and its ability to pick up different sized items by individually actuating its suction cups based on the item’s size and physical features.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=1657|title=ECBC, ARL collaborate on octopus-inspired suction cup|last=|first=|date=February 12, 2013|work=Army Research Laboratory|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal geometry of the self-sealing suction cup was designed to the smallest possible size and features a minimum wall thickness of 1.02&amp;nbsp;mm, a tube diameter of 1.59&amp;nbsp;mm, and minimum part spacing of 0.13&amp;nbsp;mm. The suction cup incorporates a mix of rubber and plastic components, where the cup lip, base, tube, springs, and plug are made out of soft rubber while the cup side, collar, hinges, and flange are made out of plastic. As part of its design, a central [[vacuum pump]] can be used to maximize the suction force of the suction cup.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A multi-material [[3d printer|3D printer]] was used to create the prototype of the self-sealing suction cup in about 20 minutes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Inside the self-sealing suction cup, the plug is positioned close to the tube opening so that it can get sucked into the tube seal the hole when the central suction line is powered. A pair of springs connected to the suction cup’s base helps maintain the plug’s position, restoring the plug seal in the absence of object forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the cup makes contact with an object, a hinge action raises the plug away from the suction tube. The moment the cup’s lips are pushed against the object, the passive reaction forces from the cup lips are transferred to the rubber base of the cup, which stretches over the collar and allow the structure to compress. Acting as a pivot for the hinges, the collar causes the hinges to rotate and the edges of the hinges slide along the underside of the flange and raise the plug away from the suction tube opening. As a result, the suction cup self-seals when not in contact with an object and self-opens the cup’s lips makes contacts with an object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, several improvements were made to the design of the self-sealing suction cup to improve its grasping capabilities. The previous design demonstrated the following flaws:&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=November 21, 2015|title=Compact Hand with Passive Grasping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm3_CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=self-sealing+suction+cup+array+for+grasping+%22army+research%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UNQMkZUWVM&amp;sig=Of1S1QQhxBt2N2Hwa5qkGcQDq_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhqo2yv7rcAhXMUt8KHcSeAnQQ6AEITDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=self-sealing%20suction%20cup%20array%20for%20grasping%20%22army%20research%22&amp;f=false|journal=Experimental Robotics: The 14th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics|volume=|pages=117–126|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The design required a high overall cup height, which increased the bulk of the device.
# The design was relatively fragile with respect to [[Hyperextension|hyper-extension]] as well as [[torsional]] and [[shear force]]s.
# The internal geometry made it difficult to remove the support material inside, varying the quality of the seal.

To address these flaws, researchers from ARL decreased the number of components by consolidating the functions of several parts, which reduced the uncompressed height of the suction cup by almost 50% to 0.72&amp;nbsp;cm. The cup diameter was also reduced to 1.07&amp;nbsp;cm. A [[lever]] system was added to the base of the cup, which pivots the collar to lift the plug. In addition, the tube doubles as a spring, which helps restore the levers and the plug to their closed position. A plastic restraint was added around the cup to aid with handling the hyper-extension, shear, and torsional forces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Performance ==
The self-sealing suction cup has been subjected to a series of tests to determine the quality of its performance. A flexible test rig with four dime-sized suction cups and plastic ribs connected with rubber tubes was created for force-displacement and testing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A force-displacement test that compared the performance between the self-sealing suction cup, an identical suction cup, and a commercially available suction cup found that the internal structures of the self-sealing cup allowed more force to be exerted for the same displacement compared to the other cups. However, under identical conditions, the self-sealing cup achieved a maximum force of 12.5 N while the commercially available cup achieved a maximum force of 12.9 N.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A seal quality test measured the pressure generated from each self-sealing suction cup. The results showed that an array of four cups maintained a pressure of 93.8% atmospheric. The test also demonstrated that not all the cups were equally efficient at sealing after object contact. However, this could be the result of variation in the cups’ prior usage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During object grasping testing where the grasping range was examined, the test rig successfully grasped about 80% of the objects attempted. These items consisted of the following: TV remote, pill bottle, glue stick, eyeglasses, fork, disposable bottle, toothpaste, coffee mug, bowl, plate, book, cell phone, bar of soap, paper money, mail, keys, show, table knife, medicine box, credit card, coin, pillow, hairbrush, non-disposable bottle, wallet, magazine, soda can, newspaper, scissors, wrist watch, purse, lighter, compact disc, telephone receiver, full wine bottle, full wine glass, light bulb, lock, padded volleyball, wooden block. (4) As a demonstration of the cups’ strength, the ARL researchers were able to pick up a full bottle of wine using only four of the dime-sized suction cups.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Use in Robotics ==
The self-sealing suction cups have been incorporated in robots to improve their passive grasping capabilities. Due to the design of the suction cups, a central vacuum source can be used to effectively generate suction force from the cups and reduce the number of actuators and sensors for the robot.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|date=February 12, 2016|title=Versatile Passive Grasping for Manipulation|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7406751/|journal=IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1293–1302|doi=10.1109/TMECH.2016.2520306|via=IEEE Xplore Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from ARL designed and developed a three-finger hand actuator system using a 3D printer in order for the robot to properly utilize the self-sealing suction cups. Four suction cups run along the bottom of each finger, which contains a narrow vacuum channel running through the center. A central vacuum pump serves to power the suction cups and facilitate grasping. The fingers can also curl around the object to better grasp it and release any object in its hold by feeding back the output of the vacuum pump and emitting a burst of [[positive pressure]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The three-finger hand has been used by aerial systems and has demonstrated considerable success in grasping objects on the ground while maintaining flight. According to ARL researchers, the self-sealing suction cups may exhibit higher rates of success underwater due to the extra pressure from the sea depths surrounding and pressing against the object and grasper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, they noted that an underwater environment would require different manufacturing materials that would allow the suction cups to perform well in salt water, such as a thermal plastic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Orion1 big.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Airglow made visible from aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]

'''Sky brightness''' refers to the [[visual perception]] of the [[sky]] and how it [[light scattering|scatters]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuses]] light. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at [[night]] is easily visible. If light sources (e.g. the [[moonlight|Moon]] and [[light pollution]]) were removed from the [[night sky]], it would appear absolutely dark. [[Silhouette]]s of objects against the sky itself would not be visible.

The sky's brightness varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause differs as well. During [[daytime]], when the [[Sun]] is above the horizon, the [[Rayleigh scattering|direct scattering]] of [[sunlight]] is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. During [[twilight]] (the duration after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]] until or since, respectively, the full darkness of night), the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required.

Twilight (both [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]) is divided into three 6° segments that mark the Sun's position below the horizon. At [[civil twilight]], the center of the Sun's disk appears to be between 1/4° and 6° below the horizon. At [[nautical twilight]], the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] is between –6° and –12°. At [[astronomical twilight]], the Sun is between –12° and –18°. When the Sun's depth is more than 18°, the sky generally attains its maximum darkness.

Sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include [[airglow]], indirect scattering of [[sunlight]], scattering of [[starlight]], and [[skyglow|light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Patat |url=http://www.eso.org/~fpatat/science/skybright/ |title=The Brightness of the Night Sky |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airglow==
When physicist [[Anders Ångström]] examined the spectrum of the [[aurora borealis]], he discovered that even on nights when the aurora was absent, its characteristic green line was still present. It was not until the 1920s that scientists were beginning to identify and understand the [[emission line]]s in aurorae and of the sky itself, and what was causing them. The green line Angstrom observed is in fact an emission line with a wavelength of 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, caused by the recombination of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

Airglow is the collective name of the various processes in the upper atmosphere that result in the emission of photons, with the driving force being primarily [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the Sun. Several emission lines are dominant: a green line from oxygen at 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, a yellow doublet from sodium at 589.0 and 589.6&amp;nbsp;nm, and red lines from oxygen at 630.0 and 636.4&amp;nbsp;nm.

The sodium emissions come from a thin [[sodium layer]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km thick at an altitude of 90–100&amp;nbsp;km, above the [[mesopause]] and in the D-layer of the [[ionosphere]]. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of [[sea salt]] and [[meteor]]itic dust.

In daytime, sodium and red oxygen emissions are dominant and roughly 1,000 times as bright as nighttime emissions because in daytime, the upper atmosphere is fully exposed to solar UV radiation. The effect is however not noticeable to the human eye, since the glare of [[Rayleigh scattering|directly scattered]] sunlight outshines and obscures it.

==Indirect scattering of sunlight==
[[Image:Illuminated-arimass.png|250px|thumb|Amount of air still illuminated after sunset, at the horizon. Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass]]
Indirectly scattered sunlight comes from two directions. From the atmosphere itself, and from outer space. In the first case, the sun has just set but still illuminates the upper atmosphere directly. Because the amount of scattered sunlight is proportional to the number of scatterers (i.e. air molecules) in the line of sight, the intensity of this light decreases rapidly as the sun drops further below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere.

When the sun's altitude is &lt; -6° 99% of the atmosphere in [[zenith]] is in the Earth's shadow and second order scattering takes over. At the horizon, however, 35% of the atmosphere along the line of sight is still directly illuminated, and continues to be until the sun reaches -12°. From -12° to -18° only the uppermost parts of the atmosphere along the horizon, directly above the spot where the sun is, is still illuminated. After that, all direct illumination ceases and astronomical darkness sets in.

A second source sunlight is the [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by reflection and scattering of sunlight on interplanetary dust. Zodiacal light varies quite a lot in intensity depending on the position of the earth, location of the observer, time of year, and composition and distribution of the reflecting dust.

==Scattered light from extraterrestrial sources==
Not only sunlight is scattered by the molecules in the air. Starlight and the diffuse light of the milky way are also scattered by the air, and it is found that stars up to V magnitude 16 contribute to the diffuse scattered starlight.

Other sources such as galaxies and nebulae don't contribute significantly.

The total brightness of all the stars was first measured by Burns in 1899, with a calculated result that the total brightness reaching earth was equivalent to that of 2,000 first-magnitude stars &lt;ref&gt;Burns, G. J., "The total amount of starlight and the brightness of the sky," ''The Observatory, Vol. 33'', p. 123-129, March 1910; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1910Obs....33..123B SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent measurements by others.&lt;ref&gt;Yntema, L., "On the Brightness of the Sky and Total Amount of Starlight," ''Publications of the Kapteyn Astronomical Laboratory Groningen, vol. 22'', pp.1-55 (1909); available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1909PGro...22....1Y SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
''

==Light pollution==
{{Main|Light pollution}}
Light pollution is an ever-increasing source of sky brightness in [[Urban area|urbanized area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In densely populated areas that do not have stringent light pollution control, the entire night sky is regularly 5 to 50 times brighter than it would be if all lights were switched off, and very often the influence of light pollution is far greater than natural sources (including moonlight). With [[urbanization]] and light pollution, one third of humanity, and the majority of those in developed countries, cannot see the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution|title=Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2016-06-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twilight==
When the sun has just set, the brightness of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and nautical twilight.

After the sun has also set for these altitudes at the end of nautical twilight, the intensity of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.

When astronomical darkness has set in, the green 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen line is dominant, and atmospheric scattering of starlight occurs.

Differential refraction causes different parts of the spectrum to dominate, producing a [[Golden hour (photography)|golden hour]] and a [[blue hour]].

==Relative contributions==
The following table gives the relative and absolute contributions to night sky brightness at zenith on a perfectly dark night at middle latitudes without moonlight and in the absence of any [[light pollution]].

(The S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; unit is defined as the surface brightness of a star whose V-magnitude is 10 and whose light is smeared over one square degree, or 27.78 mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The total sky brightness in zenith is therefore ~220 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or 21.9 mag/arcsec² in the V-band. Note that the contributions from Airglow and Zodiacal light vary with the time of year, the solar cycle, and the observer's latitude roughly as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Airglow}/{\rm S}_{10} = 145+108(S-0.8)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the solar 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm flux in MJy, and various sinusoidally between 0.8 and 2.0 with the 11-year solar cycle, yielding an upper contribution of ~270 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; at solar maximum.

The intensity of zodiacal light depends on the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude and longitude]] of the point in the sky being observed relative to that of the sun. At ecliptic longitudes differing from the sun's by &gt; 90 degrees, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm ZodiacalLight}/{\rm S}_{10} = 140 - 90\sin(|\beta|)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''β'' is the ecliptic latitude and is smaller than 60°, when larger than 60 degrees the contribution is that given in the table. Along the ecliptic plane there are enhancements in the zodiacal light where it is much brighter near the sun and with a secondary maximum opposite the sun at 180 degrees longitude (the [[gegenschein]]).

In extreme cases natural zenith sky brightness can be as high as ~21.0 mag/arcsec², roughly twice as bright as nominal conditions.

'''''The Evolution of God''''' is a 2009 book by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], in which the author explores the history of the concept of [[God]] in the three [[Abrahamic religions]] through a variety of means, including [[archeology]], history, [[theology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. The patterns which link [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] and the ways in which they have changed their concepts over time are explored as one of the central themes.

One of the conclusions of the book that Wright tries to make is a reconciliation [[Relationship between religion and science|between science and religion]].  He also speculates on the future of the concept of God.

==Evolutionary biology==
Among other things, Wright discusses the role of [[evolutionary biology]] in the development of religion. Geneticist [[Dean Hamer]] hypothesized that some people have a specific gene that makes them prone to religious belief, which he calls the [[God gene]], and that over time natural selection has favored these people because their spirituality leads to optimism. Wright, however, thinks the tendency towards religious belief is not an adaptive trait influenced by natural selection, but rather a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] - a trait that happens to be supported by adaptations originally selected for other purposes. Wright states that the human brain approaches religious belief based on how it adapted to survive and reproduce in early hunter-gatherer societies.

He points out four key traits of religion that align with the human brain's survival adaptations:
*Its claims can be surprising, strange, and even counterintuitive.
*It claims to show what causes good and bad things to happen.
*It tells people that they can control these causes and increase the ratio of good to bad results.
*It is hard to falsify or disprove.
Humans have adapted to pay attention to surprising and confusing information, because it could make the difference between life and death. (For instance, if a person left the campsite and mysteriously never returned, it would be wise for the others to be on guard for a predator or some other danger.) Understanding and controlling cause and effect also takes top priority in the human brain, since humans live in complex social groups where predicting and influencing the actions and thoughts of others gains them allies, status, and access to resources. As human cognitive abilities and curiosity expanded over the centuries, their investigation of cause and effect expanded from the strictly social context out into the world at large, opening the doors for religions to explain things like weather and disease.

Though some of these explanations were strange and perhaps dubious, the fact that they could not be completely disproven lent them credibility; it was better to be cautious than dead. Wright uses an example from the [[Haida people]], indigenous to the northwest coast of North America, who would try to appease killer whale deities to calm storms out at sea; they would pour fresh water into the ocean or tie tobacco or deer tallow to the end of a paddle. While some people certainly died despite these offerings, those who survived were a testament to the ritual's possible efficacy.

Mysterious and unproven beliefs can also persist in a culture because human brains have adapted to agree with the group consensus even if it goes against one's better judgment or personal beliefs, since a person alienated from the group loses protection, food, and mates. Wright cites the [[Asch conformity experiments]] and even posits that [[Stockholm syndrome]] is not so much a syndrome as a natural product of evolution, the brain's way of ensuring that a person accepts and is accepted by his or her new social group. In addition, beliefs can persist because once a person publicly announces a belief, social psychologists have found that he or she is inclined to focus on evidence supporting that belief while conveniently ignoring evidence contradicting it, a logical fallacy known as [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]].

==Reviews==
Journalist and political commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] gave the book a positive review in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', saying that the book "...gave me hope that we can avoid both the barrenness of a world without God and the horrible fusion of fundamentalism and weapons of mass destruction." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/05/the-evolution-of-god.html Andrew Sullivan's blog post linking to his review], from ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6255785.ece Sullivan's full review of the book] from ''[[The Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' religion editor, [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]], described ''The Evolution of God'' as a reframing of the [[faith]] vs. reason debate. Drawing a contrast to such authors as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]], Miller gives an overall positive review of the book's approach to the examination of the concept of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/199697 Let’s Talk About God] from ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Yale professor of psychology [[Paul Bloom (professor)|Paul Bloom]] said, "In his brilliant new book, “The Evolution of God,” Robert Wright tells the story of how God grew up."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=1 Review of ''The Evolution of God''] from ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom sums up Wright's controversial stance as, "Wright’s tone is reasoned and careful, even hesitant, throughout, and it is nice to read about issues like the morality of Christ and the meaning of jihad without getting the feeling that you are being shouted at. His views, though, are provocative and controversial. There is something here to annoy almost everyone."

However, in a ''New York Times'' review that included a reply from Wright, [[Nicholas Wade]], a writer for the "Science Times" section, notes the book is "a disappointment from the Darwinian perspective", because evolution "provides a simpler explanation for moral progression than the deity Wright half invokes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/the-non-evolution-of-god/ The Non-Evolution of God], a July 2009 blog post from the ''New York Times'' website&lt;/ref&gt; Wright replied to Wade's comments, saying Wade had misunderstood Wright's argument and that "The deity (if there is one–and I’m agnostic on that point) would be realizing moral progress through evolution’s creation of the human moral sense (and through the subsequent development of that moral sense via cultural evolution, particularly technological evolution)."&lt;ref name="nyteog2"&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/non-evolution-of-god-part-2/ Non-Evolution of God, Part 2], a July 2009 blog post from the ''New York Times'' website&lt;/ref&gt;  Wade replied that "evolution seems to me a sufficient explanation for the moral progress that Mr. Wright correctly discerns in the human condition, so there seemed no compelling need to invoke a deity."&lt;ref name="nyteog2"/&gt;

==Promotional appearances==

'''''Unequal crossing over''''' is a type of gene duplication or deletion event that deletes a sequence in one strand and replaces it with a duplication from its sister [[chromatid]] in [[mitosis]] or from its homologous chromosome during [[meiosis]].  It is a type of [[chromosomal crossover]] between homologous sequences that are not paired precisely. Normally genes are responsible for occurrence of crossing over. It exchanges sequences of different links between chromosomes.  Along with [[gene conversion]], it is believed to be the main  driver for the generation of [[gene duplication]]s and is a source of mutation in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution |edition=Second |last1=Graur |first1=Dan |last2=Li |first2=Wen-Hsiung |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0878932666 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Molecular_Evolution.html?id=Bf5-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
During [[meiosis]], the duplicated chromosomes ([[chromatids]]) in eukaryotic organisms are attached to each other in the [[centromere]] region and are thus paired. The maternal and paternal chromosomes then align alongside each other.  During this time, recombination can take place via crossing over of sections of the paternal and maternal chromatids and leads to reciprocal recombination or non-reciprocal recombination.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Unequal crossing over requires a measure of similarity between the sequences for misalignment to occur.  The more similarity within the sequences, the more likely unequal crossing over will occur.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  One of the sequences is thus lost and replaced with the duplication of another sequence.

When two sequences are misaligned, unequal crossing over may create a tandem repeat on one chromosome and a deletion on the other.  The rate of unequal crossing over will increase with the number of repeated sequences around the duplication.  This is because these repeated sequences will pair together, allowing for the mismatch in the cross over point to occur.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics |last=Russel |first=Peter J. |date=2002 |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences for the organism==
Unequal crossing over is the process most responsible for creating regional gene duplications in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Repeated rounds of unequal crossing over cause the homogenization of the two sequences.  With the increase in the duplicates, unequal crossing over can lead to dosage imbalance in the genome and can be highly deleterious.&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt;&lt;ref name=russell /&gt;

==Evolutionary implications==
In unequal crossing over, there can be large sequence exchanges between the chromosomes.  Compared with gene conversion, which can only transfer a maximum of 1,500 base pairs, unequal crossing over in yeast rDNA genes has been found to transfer about 20,000 base pairs in a single crossover event&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="szostak1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=J. W. |last2=Wu |first2=R. |title=Unequal crossing over in the ribosomal DNA of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''| doi = 10.1038/284426a0 |journal=Nature |volume=284 |pages=426–430 |date=1980 |issue=5755|bibcode=1980Natur.284..426S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal crossover can be followed by the [[concerted evolution]] of  duplicated sequences.

It has been suggested that longer intron found between two beta-globin genes are a response to deleterious selection from unequal crossing over in the beta-globin genes.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zimmer1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmer |first1=E. A. |last2=Martin |first2=S. M. |last3=Beverley |first3=S. M. |last4=Kan |first4=Y. W. |last5=Wilson |first5=A. C. |title=Rapid duplication and loss of genes coding for the alpha chains of hemoglobin |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=77 |pages=2158–2162 |date=1980 | pmc=348671 | doi =10.1073/pnas.77.4.2158 |pmid=6929543|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.2158Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparisons between alpha-globin, which does not have long introns, and beta-globin genes show that alpha-globin have 50 times higher concerted evolution.

When unequal crossing over creates a [[gene duplication]], the duplicate has 4 [[evolution]]ary fates. This is due to the fact that [[purifying selection]] acting on a duplicated copy is not very strong.  Now that there is a redundant copy, [[neutral mutation]]s can act on the duplicate.  Most commonly the neutral mutations will continue until the duplicate becomes a [[pseudogene]].  If the duplicate copy increases the dosage effect of the gene product, then the duplicate may be retained as a redundant copy.  [[Neofunctionalization]] is also a possibility: the duplicated copy acquires a mutation that gives it a different function than its ancestor.  If both copies acquire mutations, it is possible that a [[subfunctionalization|subfunctional event]] occurs.  This happens when both of the duplicated sequences have a more specialized function than the ancestral copy&lt;ref name=force1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Force |first1=Allan |last2=Lynch |first2=Michael |last3=Pickettb |first3=F.

===Genome size===
Gene duplications are the main reason for the increase of genome size, and as unequal crossing over is the main mechanism for gene duplication, unequal crossing over contributes to genome size evolution is the most common regional duplication event that increases the size of the genome.

====Junk DNA====
When viewing the genome of a eukaryote, a striking observation is the large amount of tandem, repetitive DNA sequences that make up a large portion of the genome.  For example, over 50% of the ''Dipodmys ordii'' genome is made up of three specific repeats. ''Drosophila virilis'' has three sequences that make up 40% of the genome, and 35% of the ''Absidia glauca'' is repetitive DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  These short sequences have no selection pressure acting on them and the frequency of the repeats can be changed by unequal crossing over.&lt;ref name="zhang2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=J. |title=Evolution of the human ASPM gene, a major determinant of brain size |journal=Genetics |volume=165 |pages=2063–2070 |date=2003 | pmid = 14704186 |issue=4 |pmc=1462882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|access-date=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''valve''' (British usage) or, colloquially, a '''tube''' (North America),&lt;ref&gt;John Algeo, "Types of English heteronyms", p. 23 in, Edgar Werner Schneider (ed), ''Englishes Around the World: General studies, British Isles, North America'', John Benjamins Publishing, 1997 {{ISBN|9027248761}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a device that controls [[electric current]] flow in a high [[vacuum]] between [[electrode]]s to which an electric [[voltage|potential difference]] has been applied.

The type known as a '''thermionic tube''' or '''thermionic valve''' uses the phenomenon of [[thermionic emission]] of electrons from a heated [[hot cathode|cathode]] and is used for a number of fundamental electronic functions such as signal [[amplifier|amplification]] and current [[rectifier|rectification]].
 
Non-thermionic types, such as a vacuum [[phototube]] however, achieve electron emission through the [[photoelectric effect]], and are used for such as the detection of light levels. In both types, the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the [[anode]] by the [[electric field]] in the tube.

The simplest vacuum tube, the [[diode]] invented in 1904 by [[John Ambrose Fleming]], contains only a heated electron-emitting cathode and an anode. Current can only flow in one direction through the device from the cathode to the anode. Adding one or more [[control grid]]s within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grid or grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoddeson|first=L|title=The Vacuum Tube|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415063342/http://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices became a key component of electronic circuits for the first half of the twentieth century. They were crucial to the development of radio, television, radar, [[sound recording and reproduction]], long distance [[telephone]] networks, and analogue and early digital [[computers]]. Although some applications had used earlier technologies such as the [[spark gap transmitter]] for radio or [[mechanical computer]]s for computing, it was the invention of the thermionic vacuum tube that made these technologies widespread and practical, and created the discipline of [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macksey |first1=Kenneth |last2=Woodhouse |first2=William |year=1991 |chapter=Electronics |title=The Penguin encyclopedia of modern warfare: 1850 to the present day |publisher=Viking |page=110 |isbn=978-0-670-82698-8 |quote=The electronics age may be said to have been ushered in with the invention of the vacuum diode valve in 1902 by the Briton John Fleming (himself coining the word 'electronics'), the immediate application being in the field of radio.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s the invention of [[semiconductor]] devices made it possible to produce [[Solid state electronics|solid-state]] devices, which are smaller, more efficient, reliable and durable, and cheaper than thermionic tubes. From the mid-1960s, thermionic tubes were then being replaced by the [[transistor]]. However, the [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) remained the basis for [[television]] monitors and [[oscilloscopes]] until the early 21st century. Thermionic tubes still have some applications, such as the [[magnetron]] used in microwave ovens, and certain high-frequency amplifiers.

Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes. [[Gas-filled tube]]s are similar devices, but containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to [[electric discharge in gases]], usually without a heater.

==Classifications==
One classification of thermionic vacuum tubes is by the number of active electrodes. A device with two active elements  is a [[diode]], usually used for [[Rectifier|rectification]]. Devices with three elements are [[triode]]s used for amplification and switching. Additional electrodes create [[tetrode]]s, [[pentode]]s, and so forth, which have multiple additional functions made possible by the additional controllable electrodes.

Other classifications are:
* by frequency range ([[audio frequency|audio]], radio, [[VHF]], [[UHF]], [[microwave]])
* by power rating (small-signal, audio power, high-power radio transmitting)
* by [[Hot cathode|cathode]]/[[electrical filament|filament]] type (indirectly heated, directly heated) and [[Antique radio#Warm-up time|Warm-up time]] (including "bright-emitter" or "dull-emitter")
* by characteristic curves design (e.g., sharp- versus remote-[[Cut-off (electronics)#Valves|cutoff]] in some pentodes)
* by application (receiving tubes, transmitting tubes, amplifying or switching, rectification, mixing)
* specialized parameters (long life, very low [[Microphonics|microphonic sensitivity]] and low-noise audio amplification, rugged/military versions)
* specialized functions (light or radiation detectors, video imaging tubes)
* tubes used to display [[information]] ([[Nixie tube]]s, [[Magic eye tube|"magic eye" tubes]], [[Vacuum fluorescent displays]], [[Cathode ray tube|CRTs]])

Tubes have different functions, such as [[cathode ray tube]]s which create a beam of electrons for display purposes (such as the television picture tube) in addition to more specialized functions such as [[electron microscopy]] and [[electron beam lithography]]. [[X-ray tube]]s are also vacuum tubes. [[Phototube]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s rely on electron flow through a vacuum, though in those cases electron emission from the cathode depends on energy from [[photon]]s rather than [[thermionic emission]]. Since these sorts of "vacuum tubes" have functions other than electronic amplification and rectification they are described in their own articles.

A vacuum tube consists of two or more [[electrode]]s in a vacuum inside an airtight envelope. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a [[glass-to-metal seal]] based on [[kovar]] sealable [[borosilicate glass]]es, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a [[tube socket]]. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a [[top cap]]. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morgan |last=Jones |title=Valve Amplifiers |page=580 |publisher=Elsevier |date=2012 |isbn=0080966403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George Henry |last=Olsen |title=Electronics: A General Introduction for the Non-Specialist |page=391 |publisher=Springer |date=2013 |isbn=1489965351}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bases were commonly made with [[phenolic insulation]] which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions.

There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.

The earliest vacuum tubes evolved from [[incandescent light bulb]]s, containing a [[electrical filament|filament]] [[glass-to-metal seal|sealed]] in an evacuated  glass envelope. When hot, the filament releases [[electron]]s into the vacuum, a process called [[thermionic emission]], originally known as the "Edison Effect". A second electrode, the [[anode]] or ''plate'', will attract those electrons if it is at a more positive voltage. The result is a net flow of electrons from the filament to plate. However, electrons cannot flow in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons. The filament (''[[cathode]]'') has a dual function: it emits electrons when heated; and, together with the plate, it creates an electric field due to the potential difference between them. Such a tube with only two electrodes is termed a [[diode]], and is used for [[Rectifier|rectification]]. Since current can only pass in one direction, such a diode (or ''[[rectifier]]'') will convert alternating current (AC) to pulsating DC. Diodes can therefore be used in a DC [[power supply]], as a [[demodulator]] of [[amplitude modulated]] (AM) radio signals and for similar functions.

Early tubes used the filament as the cathode; this is called a "directly heated" tube. Most modern tubes are "indirectly heated" by a "heater" element inside a metal tube that is the cathode. The heater is electrically isolated from the surrounding cathode and simply serves to heat the cathode sufficiently for [[thermionic emission]] of electrons. The electrical isolation allows all the tubes' heaters to be supplied from a common circuit (which can be AC without inducing hum) while allowing the cathodes in different tubes to operate at different voltages.  [[H. J. Round]] invented the indirectly heated tube around 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Bray |title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet |publisher=IET |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203055405/https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;hl=en |archivedate=3 December 2016 |df=dmy-all |isbn=9780852962183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filaments require constant and often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur even in an idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by [[black-body radiation|radiation]] through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.

[[Klystron]]s and [[cavity magnetron|magnetrons]] often operate their anodes (called '''collectors''' in klystrons) at ground potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high-voltage insulation. These tubes instead operate with high negative voltages on the filament and cathode.

Except for diodes, additional electrodes are positioned between the cathode and the plate (anode). These electrodes are referred to as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass on their way to the plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a [[triode]], [[tetrode]], [[pentode]], etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a ''voltage-controlled device'': the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field which repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit). The solid-state device which operates most like the pentode tube is the [[junction field-effect transistor]] (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.

==History and development==
[[Image:Edison effect bulb 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|One of Edison's experimental bulbs]]
The 19th century saw increasing research with evacuated tubes, such as the [[Geissler tube|Geissler]] and [[Crookes tube]]s. The many scientists and inventors who experimented with such tubes include [[Thomas Edison]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]]. With the exception of early [[light bulb]]s, such tubes were only used in scientific research or as novelties. The groundwork laid by these scientists and inventors, however, was critical to the development of subsequent vacuum tube technology.

Although [[thermionic emission]] was originally reported in 1873 by [[Frederick Guthrie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick |last=Guthrie |authorlink=Frederick Guthrie |title=Magnetism and Electricity |date=1876 |location=London and Glasgow |publisher=William Collins, Sons, &amp; Company |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UuoDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517001705/https://books.google.com/books?id=UuoDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was Thomas Edison's apparently independent discovery of the phenomenon in 1883 that became well known. Although Edison was aware of the unidirectional property of current flow between the filament and the anode, his interest (and patent&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Edison {{US patent|307031}} "Electrical Indicator", Issue date: 1884&lt;/ref&gt;) concentrated on the sensitivity of the anode current to the current through the filament (and thus filament temperature). Little practical use was ever made of this property (however early radios often implemented volume controls through varying the filament current of amplifying tubes). It was only years later that [[John Ambrose Fleming]] utilized the rectifying property of the diode tube to detect ([[demodulate]]) radio signals, a substantial improvement on the early [[cat's-whisker detector]] already used for rectification.

However actual amplification by a vacuum tube only became practical with [[Lee De Forest]]'s 1907 invention of the three-terminal "[[audion]]" tube, a crude form of what was to become the [[triode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: Early devices and the rise of radio communications|journal=IEEE Ind.

The electronics revolution of the 20th century arguably began with the invention of the triode vacuum tube.

===Diodes===
[[Image:Fleming valves.jpg|thumb|Fleming's first diodes]]
{{main|Diode}}
The English physicist [[John Ambrose Fleming]] worked as an engineering consultant for firms including [[Edison and Swan Electric Light Company|Edison Swan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mazda Valves|url=http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/ephemera/vemazda.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628205923/http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/ephemera/vemazda.htm|archivedate=2013-06-28|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edison Telephone and the [[Marconi Company]]. In 1904, as a result of experiments conducted on Edison effect bulbs imported from the United States, he developed a device he called an "oscillation valve" (because it passes current in only one direction). The heated filament, was capable of [[thermionic emission]] of electrons that would flow to the ''[[Plate electrode|plate]]'' (or ''[[anode]]'') when it was at a positive voltage with respect to the heated cathode. Electrons, however, could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons.

Later known as the [[Fleming valve]], it could be used as a [[rectifier]] of alternating current and as a radio wave [[Detector (radio)|detector]]. This greatly improved the [[crystal set]] which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called [[cat's whisker]], an adjustable point contact. Unlike modern semiconductors, such a diode required painstaking adjustment of the contact to the crystal in order for it to rectify.

The tube was relatively immune to vibration, and thus vastly superior on shipboard duty, particularly for navy ships with the shock of weapon fire commonly knocking the sensitive but delicate galena off its sensitive point (the tube was in general no more sensitive as a radio detector, but was adjustment free). The diode tube was a reliable alternative for detecting radio signals.

As electronic engineering advanced, notably during World War II, this function of a diode came to be considered as one type of demodulation. While firmly established by history, the term "detector" is not of itself descriptive, and should be considered outdated.

Higher power diode tubes or ''power rectifiers'' found their way into power supply applications until they were eventually replaced first by selenium, and later, by silicon rectifiers in the 1960s.

===Triodes===
{{main|Triode}}
[[Image:Triode tube 1906.jpg|thumb|The first triode, the De Forest [[Audion]], invented in 1906]]

[[File:Triode.PNG|thumb|upright|Triode symbol. From top to bottom: plate (anode), control grid, cathode, heater (filament)]]
Originally, the only use for tubes in radio circuits was for [[Rectifier|rectification]], not amplification. In 1906, [[Robert von Lieben]] filed for a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Robert von Lieben&amp;nbsp;— Patent Nr&amp;nbsp;179807 Dated November 19, 1906 | publisher = Kaiserliches Patentamt | date = 19 November 1906 | url = http://www.hts-homepage.de/Lieben/DRP179807.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528125703/http://www.hts-homepage.de/Lieben/DRP179807.pdf | archivedate = 28 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[cathode ray tube]] which included magnetic deflection. This could be used for amplifying audio signals and was intended for use in telephony equipment. He would later help refine the [[triode]] vacuum tube.

However, [[Lee De Forest]] is credited with inventing the triode tube in 1907 while experimenting to improve his original (diode) [[Audion]]. By placing an additional electrode between the filament ([[cathode]]) and [[plate electrode|plate]] (anode), he discovered the ability of the resulting device to amplify signals. As the voltage applied to the [[control grid]] (or simply "grid") was lowered from the cathode's voltage to somewhat more negative voltages, the amount of current from the filament to the plate would be reduced.

The negative electrostatic field created by the grid in the vicinity of the cathode would inhibit passage of emitted electrons and reduce the current to the plate. Thus, a few volt difference at the grid would make a large change in the plate current and could lead to a much larger voltage change at the plate; the result was voltage and power [[amplifier|amplification]]. In 1908, De Forest was granted a patent ({{US patent|879532}}) for such a three-electrode version of his original Audion for use as an electronic amplifier in radio communications. This eventually became known as the triode.

[[Image:General electric pliotron pp schenectady 3.jpg|thumb|upright|General Electric Company Pliotron, [[Science History Institute]]]]
De Forest's original device was made with conventional vacuum technology. The vacuum was not a "hard vacuum" but rather left a very small amount of residual gas. The physics behind the device's operation was also not settled. The residual gas would cause a blue glow (visible ionization) when the plate voltage was high (above about 60 volts). In 1912, De Forest brought the Audion to Harold Arnold in AT&amp;T's engineering department. Arnold recommended that AT&amp;T purchase the patent, and AT&amp;T followed his recommendation. Arnold developed high-vacuum tubes which were tested in the summer of 1913 on AT&amp;T's long distance network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/15tel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005081147/http://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/15tel.html |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-vacuum tubes could operate at high plate voltages without a blue glow.

Finnish inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] significantly improved on the original triode design in 1914, while working on his [[sound-on-film]] process in Berlin, Germany. Tigerstedt's innovation was to make the electrodes concentric cylinders with the cathode at the centre, thus greatly increasing the collection of emitted electrons at the anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antti V. |last=Räisänen |first2=Arto |last2=Lehto |title=Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications |page=7 |publisher=Artech House |date=2003 |isbn=1580536697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irving Langmuir]] at the [[General Electric]] research laboratory ([[Schenectady, New York]]) had improved [[Wolfgang Gaede]]'s [[diffusion pump|high-vacuum diffusion pump]] and used it to settle the question of thermionic emission and conduction in a vacuum. Consequently, General Electric started producing hard vacuum triodes (which were branded Pliotrons) in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edisontechcenter.org/GEresearchLab.html|title=General Electric Research Lab History|last=Center|first=Copyright 2015 Edison Tech|website=edisontechcenter.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langmuir patented the hard vacuum triode, but De Forest and AT&amp;T successfully asserted priority and invalidated the patent.

Pliotrons were closely followed by the French type '[[La Compagnie des Lampes#La Compagnie des Lampes (1888)|TM]]' and later the English type 'R' which were in widespread use by the allied military by 1916. Historically, vacuum levels in production vacuum tubes typically ranged from 10 [[Pascal (pressure)|µPa]] down to 10&amp;nbsp;nPa.&lt;ref&gt;J.Jenkins and W.H.Jarvis, "Basic Principles of Electronics, Volume 1 Thermionics", Pergamon Press (1966), Ch.1.10 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The triode and its derivatives (tetrodes and pentodes) are [[transconductance]] devices, in which the controlling signal applied to the grid is a ''voltage'', and the resulting amplified signal appearing at the anode is a ''current''. Compare this to the behavior of the [[bipolar junction transistor]], in which the controlling signal is a current and the output is also a current.

For vacuum tubes, transconductance or mutual conductance ({{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is defined as the change in the plate(anode)/cathode current divided by the corresponding change in the grid to cathode voltage, with a constant plate(anode) to cathode voltage. Typical values of {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} for a small-signal vacuum tube are 1 to 10 millisiemens. It is one of the three 'constants' of a vacuum tube, the other two being its gain μ and plate resistance {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The Van der Bijl equation defines their relationship as follows: &lt;math&gt;gm = {\mu \over R_p}&lt;/math&gt;

The non-linear operating characteristic of the triode caused early tube audio amplifiers to exhibit harmonic distortion at low volumes. Plotting plate current as a function of applied grid voltage, it was seen that there was a range of grid voltages for which the transfer characteristics were approximately linear.

To use this range, a negative bias voltage had to be applied to the grid to position the [[direct current|DC]] operating point in the linear region. This was called the idle condition, and the plate current at this point the "idle current". The controlling voltage was superimposed onto the bias voltage, resulting in a linear variation of plate current in response to both positive and negative variation of the input voltage around that point.

This concept is called ''[[grid bias]]''. Many early radio sets had a third battery called the "C battery" (unrelated to the present-day [[C battery|C cell]], for which the letter denotes its size and shape). The C battery's positive terminal was connected to the cathode of the tubes (or "ground" in most circuits) and whose negative terminal supplied this bias voltage to the grids of the tubes.

Later circuits, after tubes were made with heaters isolated from their cathodes, used [[cathode bias]]ing, avoiding the need for a separate negative power supply. For cathode biasing, a relatively low-value resistor is connected between the cathode and ground. This makes the cathode positive with respect to the grid, which is at ground potential for DC.

However C batteries continued to be included in some equipment even when the "A" and "B" batteries had been replaced by power from the AC mains. That was possible because there was essentially no current draw on these batteries; they could thus last for many years (often longer than all the tubes) without requiring replacement.

When triodes were first used in radio transmitters and receivers, it was found that tuned amplification stages had a tendency to oscillate unless their gain was very limited. This was due to the parasitic capacitance between the plate (the amplifier's output) and the control grid (the amplifier's input), known as the  [[Miller effect|Miller capacitance]].

Eventually the technique of ''neutralization'' was developed whereby the RF transformer connected to the plate (anode) would include an additional winding in the opposite phase. This winding would be connected back to the grid through a small capacitor, and when properly adjusted would cancel the Miller capacitance. This technique was employed and led to the success of the [[Neutrodyne]] radio during the 1920s.
However, neutralization required careful adjustment and proved unsatisfactory when used over a wide range of frequencies.

===Tetrodes and pentodes===
{{main|Tetrode|Pentode}}
[[File:Tetrode.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Tetrode symbol. From top to bottom: plate (anode), screen grid, control grid, cathode, heater (filament)]]
To combat the stability problems and limited voltage gain due to the [[Miller effect]], the physicist [[Walter H. Schottky]] invented the tetrode tube in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: the conquest of analog communications|journal=IEEE Ind. Electron. M.|volume=6|issue=2|pages=52–54|doi=10.1109/MIE.2012.2193274|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the addition of a second grid, located between the control grid and the plate (anode), known as the ''[[screen grid]]'', could solve these problems. ("Screen" in this case refers to electrical "screening" or shielding, not physical construction: all "grid" electrodes in between the cathode and plate are "screens" of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (anode) voltage was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the [[control grid]], essentially eliminating the Miller capacitance and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a ''[[tetrode]]'', meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.

[[File:Tetrode.png|thumb|right| At certain values of plate voltage and current, the tetrode characteristic curves are kinked due to secondary emission.]]
However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, electrons strike the anode with sufficient energy to cause the emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called [[secondary emission]] of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called "tetrode kink" and is an example of [[negative resistance]] which can itself cause instability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjseymour.plus.com/elec/valves/valves.htm Introduction to Thermionic Valves (Vacuum Tubes)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528141924/http://www.cjseymour.plus.com/elec/valves/valves.htm |date=28 May 2007 }}, Colin J. Seymour&lt;/ref&gt; The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce a simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant [[LC circuit]] to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called [[dynatron oscillator]] thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the [[tunnel diode]] oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.

The solution was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the [[suppressor grid]] (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid was held at the cathode (or "ground") voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a [[pentode]], meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by [[Bernard D. H. Tellegen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philips-historische-producten.nl/tube-uk.html |title=Philips Historical Products: Philips Vacuum Tubes |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106031350/http://www.philips-historische-producten.nl/tube-uk.html |archivedate=6 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the [[beam tetrode]] or "beam power tube", discussed below.

===Multifunction and multisection tubes===
[[File:Heptode.svg|thumb|right|160px|The pentagrid converter contained five grids between the cathode and the plate (anode).]]
[[Superheterodyne receiver]]s require a [[local oscillator]] and [[Frequency mixer|mixer]], combined in the function of a single [[pentagrid converter]] tube. Various alternatives such as using a combination of a [[triode]] with a [[Pentagrid converter#Hexode|hexode]] and even an [[Pentagrid converter#Octode|octode]] have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include both [[control grid]]s (at a low potential) and [[Tetrode|screen grids]] (at a high voltage). Many designs used such a screen grid as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current was added to that of the incoming radio frequency signal. The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers, including the miniature tube version of the "[[All American Five]]". Octodes, such as the 7A8, were rarely used in the United States, but much more common in Europe, particularly in battery operated radios where the lower power consumption was an advantage.

To further reduce the cost and complexity of radio equipment, two separate structures (triode and pentode for instance) could be combined in the bulb of a single ''multisection tube''. An early example was the [[Loewe 3NF]]. This 1920s device had three triodes in a single glass envelope together with all the fixed capacitors and resistors required to make a complete radio receiver. As the Loewe set had only one tube socket, it was able to substantially undercut the competition, since, in Germany, state tax was levied by the number of sockets. However, reliability was compromised, and production costs for the tube were much greater. In a sense, these were akin to integrated circuits. In the United States, Cleartron briefly produced the "Multivalve" triple triode for use in the Emerson Baby Grand receiver. This Emerson set also had a single tube socket, but because it used a four-pin base, the additional element connections were made on a "mezzanine" platform at the top of the tube base.

By 1940 multisection tubes had become commonplace. There were constraints, however, due to patents and other licensing considerations (see [[British Valve Association]]). Constraints due to the number of external pins (leads) often forced the functions to share some of those external connections such as their cathode connections (in addition to the heater connection). The RCA Type 55 was a [[double diode triode]] used as a detector, [[automatic gain control]] rectifier and audio [[preamplifier]] in early AC powered radios. These sets often included the 53 Dual Triode Audio Output. Another early type of multi-section tube, the [[6SN7]], is a "dual triode" which performs the functions of two triode tubes, while taking up half as much space and costing less.
The [[12AX7]] is a dual "high mu" (high voltage gain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Bonnie |title=Analog circuits |date=2008 |page=391 |publisher=Newnes |isbn=0-7506-8627-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://välljud.se/index.php/tilbehoer/ram-labs/mu-gm-and-rp-and-how-tubes-are-matched |title=Mu, Gm and Rp and how Tubes are matched |last=Modjeski |first=Roger A. |publisher=Välljud AB |accessdate=22 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321012946/http://xn--vlljud-bua.se/index.php/tilbehoer/ram-labs/mu-gm-and-rp-and-how-tubes-are-matched |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Glen |authorlink=Glen Ballou |title=Handbook for Sound Engineers: The New Audio Cyclopedia |publisher=Howard W.

The introduction of the miniature tube base (see below) which could have 9 pins, more than previously available, allowed other multi-section tubes to be introduced, such as the [[6GH8]]/ECF82 triode-pentode, quite popular in television receivers. The desire to include even more functions in one envelope resulted in the General Electric [[Compactron]] which had 12 pins. A typical example, the 6AG11, contained two triodes and two diodes.

Some otherwise conventional tubes do not fall into standard categories; the 6AR8, 6JH8 and 6ME8 had several common grids, followed by a pair of [[Beam deflection tube|beam deflection]] electrodes which deflected the current towards either of two anodes. It was sometimes known as the 'sheet beam' tube, and was used in some color TV sets for [[Chrominance|color]] [[Analog television#Color video signal extraction|demodulation]]. The similar 7360 was popular as a balanced [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] [[Product detector|(de)modulator]].

===Beam power tubes===
[[File:6L6tubespair.jpg|thumb|150px|6L6 tubes in glass envelopes]]{{main|Beam tetrode}}
The [[beam tetrode|beam]] power tube is usually a tetrode with the addition of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not to be confused with the ''[[anode]]'') focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the "tetrode kink", plate to control grid capacitance, screen grid current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the control grid creates "sheets" of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.

Aligning the grid wires also helps to reduce screen current, which represents wasted energy. This design helps to overcome some of the practical barriers to designing high-power, high-efficiency power tubes. EMI engineers Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda developed the design which became the [[6L6]], the first popular beam power tube, introduced by [[RCA]] in 1936 and later corresponding tubes in Europe the [[KT66]], [[KT77]] and [[KT88]] made by the [[Marconi-Osram Valve]] subsidiary of [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] (the KT standing for "Kinkless Tetrode").

"Pentode operation" of beam power tubes is often described in  manufacturers' handbooks and data sheets, resulting in some confusion in terminology.
They are not pentodes, of course.

Variations of the 6L6 design are still widely used in tube guitar amplifiers, making it one of the longest-lived electronic device families in history. Similar design strategies are used in the construction of large ceramic power tetrodes used in radio transmitters.

Beam power tubes can be connected as triodes for improved audio tonal quality but in triode mode deliver significantly reduced power output.

===Gas-filled tubes===
[[Gas-filled tube]]s such as [[discharge tube]]s and [[cold cathode]] tubes are not ''hard'' vacuum tubes, though are always filled with gas at less than sea-level atmospheric pressure. Types such as the [[voltage-regulator tube]] and [[thyratron]] resemble hard vacuum tubes and fit in sockets designed for vacuum tubes. Their distinctive orange, red, or purple glow during operation indicates the presence of gas; electrons flowing in a vacuum do not produce light within that region. These types may still be referred to as "electron tubes" as they do perform electronic functions. High-power rectifiers use [[mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor to achieve a lower forward voltage drop than high-vacuum tubes.[[File:CV4501.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Subminiature CV4501 tube (SQ version of EF72), {{nowrap|35 mm long}} x {{nowrap|10 mm diameter}} (excluding leads)]]

=== Miniature tubes ===
Early tubes used a metal or glass envelope atop an insulating [[bakelite]] base. In 1938 a technique was developed to use an all-glass construction&lt;ref&gt;C H Gardner (1965) [http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-001.htm The Story of the Valve] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223164546/http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-001.htm |date=23 December 2015 }}, Radio Constructor (See particularly the section "Glass Base Construction")&lt;/ref&gt; with the pins fused in the glass base of the envelope. This was used in the design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having 7 or 9 pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage where they could safely operate, and also reduced the power dissipation of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in consumer applications such as radio receivers and hi-fi amplifiers. However the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power [[rectifier]]s, in higher power audio output stages and as transmitting tubes.[[File:6DS4NuvistorVacuumTube.jpg|thumb|right|150px|RCA 6DS4 "Nuvistor" triode, circa {{nowrap|20 mm high}} by {{nowrap|11 mm diameter}}]]Subminiature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in hearing-aid amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The "[[acorn tube]]" (named due to its shape) was also very small, as was the metal-cased RCA [[nuvistor]] from 1959, about the size of a [[thimble]]. The nuvistor was developed to compete with the early transistors and operated at higher frequencies than those early transistors could. The small size supported especially high-frequency operation; nuvistors were used in aircraft radio transceivers, [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television tuners, and some HiFi FM radio tuners (Sansui 500A) until replaced by high-frequency capable transistors.

===Improvements in construction and performance===
[[File:Vacuum Tube Commercial Packages.png|thumb|Commercial packaging for vacuum tubes used in the latter half of the 20th century including boxes for individual tubes (bottom right), sleeves for rows of the boxes (left), and bags that smaller tubes would be put in by a store upon purchase (top right)]]
The earliest vacuum tubes strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and were made by lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the [[vacuum pump]]s required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used [[Heinrich Geissler]]'s mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial [[vacuum]]. The development of the [[diffusion pump]] in 1915 and improvement by [[Irving Langmuir]] led to the development of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200&amp;nbsp;°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament [[operating temperature]] to a dull red heat (around 700&amp;nbsp;°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.

===Indirectly heated cathodes===
The desire to power electronic equipment using AC mains power faced a difficulty with respect to the powering of the tubes' filaments, as these were also the cathode of each tube. Powering the filaments directly from a [[power transformer]] introduced mains-frequency (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) hum into audio stages. The invention of the "equipotential cathode" reduced this problem, with the filaments being powered by a balanced AC power transformer winding having a grounded center tap.

A superior solution, and one which allowed each cathode to "float" at a different voltage, was that of the indirectly heated cathode: a  cylinder of oxide-coated nickel acted as electron-emitting cathode, and was electrically isolated from the filament inside it. Indirectly heated cathodes enable the cathode circuit to be separated from the heater circuit. The filament, no longer electrically connected to the tube's electrodes, became simply known as a "heater", and could as well be powered by AC without any introduction of hum.&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Turner (ed.) ''Electronics Engineer's Reference Book'', 4th ed. Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 {{ISBN|0-408-00168-2}} pages 7–2 through 7-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s indirectly heated cathode tubes became widespread in equipment using AC power. Directly heated cathode tubes continued to be widely used in battery-powered equipment as their filaments required considerably less power than the heaters required with indirectly heated cathodes.

Tubes designed for high gain audio applications may have twisted heater wires to cancel out stray electric fields, fields that could induce objectionable hum into the program material.

Heaters may be energized with either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). DC is often used where low hum is required.

Flowers was also a pioneer of using tubes as very fast (compared to electromechanical devices) [[Switch#Electronic switches|electronic switches]]. Later work confirmed that tube unreliability was not as serious an issue as generally believed; the 1946 [[ENIAC]], with over 17,000 tubes, had a tube failure (which took 15 minutes to locate) on average every two days. The quality of the tubes was a factor, and the diversion of skilled people during the Second World War lowered the general quality of tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2006/0,4814,108568,00.html|title=A lost interview with ENIAC co-inventor J.

After the war, development continued with tube-based computers including, military computers [[ENIAC]] and [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]], the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] (the first commercially available electronic computer), and [[UNIVAC I]], also available commercially.

====Colossus====
{{Main|Colossus computer}}
Flowers's Colossus and its successor Colossus Mk2 were built by the British during World War II to substantially speed up the task of breaking the German high level [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz encryption]]. Using about 1,500 vacuum tubes (2,400 for Mk2), Colossus replaced an earlier machine based on relay and switch logic (the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]). Colossus was able to break in a matter of hours messages that had previously taken several weeks; it was also much more reliable.&lt;ref name=colossus/&gt; Colossus was the first use of vacuum tubes ''working in concert'' on such a large scale for a single machine.&lt;ref name=colossus/&gt;

Once Colossus was built and installed, it ran continuously, powered by dual redundant diesel generators, the wartime mains supply being considered too unreliable. The only time it was switched off was for conversion to Mk2, which added more tubes. Another nine Colossus Mk2s were built. Each Mk2 consumed 15 kilowatts; most of the power was for the tube heaters.

A Colossus reconstruction was switched on in 1996; it was upgraded to Mk2 configuration in 2004; it found the key for a wartime German [[ciphertext]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|[http://www.tnmoc.org/special-projects/colossus-rebuild/rebuilding-colossus The National Museum of Computing – Rebuilding Colossus]|[http://www.tnmoc.org/explore/colossus-gallery The National Museum of Computing – The Colossus Gallery]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Whirlwind and "special-quality" tubes====
{{Main|Whirlwind (computer)}}
To meet the reliability requirements of the 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, "special-quality" tubes with extended life, and a long-lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of [[silicon]], used in the [[tungsten]] alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy (and more frequent replacement of the [[wire]] drawing [[Die (manufacturing)#Wire pulling|dies]]) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] air-defense computer system. SAGE computers were dual installations, with one operating, and the other in standby. To locate potential tube failures in the standby computer, heater voltages were reduced, which caused failures of tubes which would otherwise fail in service. These computers continued in service years after other tube computers had been superseded.

High-purity nickel tubing and cathode coatings free of materials that can poison emission (such as [[silicate]]s and aluminum) also contribute to long cathode life. The first such "computer tube" was Sylvania's 7AK7 of 1948. Computers were the first tube devices to run tubes at cutoff (enough negative grid voltage to make them cease conduction) for quite-extended periods of time. When their grids became less negative, they failed to conduct. While hot but non-conductive, an insulating layer ("cathode interface") developed between the nickel sleeve and the oxide coating. What was described above cured this problem.

By the late 1950s it was routine for special-quality small-signal tubes to last for hundreds of thousands of hours, if operated conservatively. This increased reliability also made mid-cable amplifiers in [[Submarine communications cable|submarine cable]]s possible.

==Heat generation and cooling ==
[[File:HiPowerTube3-500 C.jpg|thumb|right| The anode (plate) of this transmitting triode has been designed to dissipate up to {{nowrap|500 W}} of heat]]
A considerable amount of heat is  produced when tubes operate, both from the filament (heater) but also from the stream of electrons bombarding the plate. In power amplifiers this source of heat will exceed the power due to cathode heating.
A few types of tube permit operation with the anodes at a dull red heat; in other types, red heat indicates severe overload.

The requirements for heat removal can significantly change the appearance of high-power vacuum tubes. High power audio amplifiers and rectifiers required larger envelopes to dissipate heat. Transmitting tubes could be much larger still.

Heat escapes the device by [[black body radiation]] from the anode (plate) as infrared radiation, and by convection of air over the tube envelope.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;RCA "Transmitting Tubes  Manual" TT-5 1962, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Convection]] is not possible inside most tubes since the anode is surrounded by vacuum.

{{anchor|Battery valve}}Tubes which generate relatively little heat, such as the 1.4-volt filament directly heated tubes designed for use in battery-powered equipment, often have shiny metal anodes. 1T4, 1R5 and 1A7 are examples. Gas-filled tubes such as [[thyratron]]s may also use a shiny metal anode, since the gas present inside the tube allows for heat convection from the anode to the glass enclosure.

The anode is often treated to make its surface emit more infrared energy. High-power amplifier tubes are designed with external anodes which can be cooled by convection, forced air or circulating water. The water-cooled 80&amp;nbsp;kg, 1.25&amp;nbsp;MW [[8974]] is among the largest commercial tubes available today.

In a water-cooled tube, the anode voltage appears directly on the cooling water surface, thus requiring the water to be an electrical insulator to prevent  high voltage leakage through the cooling water to the radiator system. Water as usually supplied has ions which conduct electricity; [[deionized water]], a good insulator, is required. Such systems usually have a built-in water-conductance monitor which will shut down the high-tension supply if the conductance  becomes too high.

The screen grid may also generate considerable heat. Limits to screen grid dissipation, in addition to plate dissipation, are listed for power devices. If these are exceeded then tube failure is likely.

==Tube packages==
[[File:6Z4 var.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Metal-cased tubes with octal bases]]
[[File:GS-9B.JPG|thumb|right|300px|High power GS-9B triode transmitting tube with heat sink at bottom.]]
Most modern tubes have glass envelopes, but metal, fused quartz ([[silica]]) and [[ceramic]] have also been used. A first version of the 6L6 used a metal envelope sealed with glass beads, while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions. Metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2&amp;nbsp;kW dissipation. The [[nuvistor]] was a modern receiving tube using a very small metal and ceramic package.

The internal elements of tubes have always been connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections at the base of the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray [[capacitance]] between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.

High-power tubes such as transmitting tubes have packages designed more to enhance heat transfer. In some tubes, the metal envelope is also the anode. The 4CX1000A is an external anode tube of this sort. Air is blown through an array of fins attached to the anode, thus cooling it. Power tubes using this cooling scheme are available up to 150&amp;nbsp;kW dissipation. Above that level, water or water-vapor cooling are used. The highest-power tube currently available is the [[Eimac]] {{as written|4CM2500KG}}, a forced water-cooled power tetrode capable of dissipating 2.5 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpii.com/docs/datasheets/78/4CM2500KG%20June%202011.pdf|title=MULTI-PHASE COOLED POWER TETRODE 4CM2500KG|quote=The maximum anode dissipation rating is 2500 kilowatts.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011144807/http://www.cpii.com/docs/datasheets/78/4CM2500KG%20June%202011.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the largest power transistor can only dissipate about 1 kilowatt.

==Names==
The generic name "[thermionic] valve" used in the UK derives from the unidirectional current flow allowed by the earliest device, the thermionic diode emitting electrons from a heated filament, by analogy with a non-return [[valve]] in a water pipe.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science, J. L. Heilbron , Oxford University Press 2003, 9780195112290, "valve, thermionic"&lt;/ref&gt; The US names "vacuum tube", "electron tube", and "thermionic tube" all simply describe a tubular envelope which has been evacuated ("vacuum"), has a heater, and controls electron flow.

In many cases manufacturers and the military gave tubes designations which said nothing about their purpose (e.g., 1614). In the early days some manufacturers used proprietary names which might convey some information, but only about their products; the KT66 and KT88 were "'''K'''inkless '''T'''etrodes". Later, consumer tubes were given names which conveyed some information, with the same name often used generically by several manufacturers. In the US, [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association]] (RETMA) [[RETMA tube designation|designations]] comprise a number, followed by one or two letters, and a number. The first number is the (rounded) heater voltage; the letters designate a particular tube but say nothing about its structure; and the final number is the total number of electrodes (without distinguishing between, say, a tube with many electrodes, or two sets of electrodes in a single envelope—a double triode, for example). For example, the [[12AX7]] is a double triode (two sets of three electrodes plus heater) with a 12.6V heater (which, as it happens, can also be connected to run from 6.3V). The "AX" has no meaning other than to designate this particular tube according to its characteristics. Similar, but not identical, tubes are the 12AD7, 12AE7...12AT7, 12AU7, 12AV7, 12AW7 (rare!), 12AY7, and the 12AZ7.

A system widely used in Europe known as the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]], also extended to transistors, uses a letter, followed by one or more further letters, and a number. The type designator specifies the heater voltage or current (one letter), the functions of all sections of the tube (one letter per section), the socket type (first digit), and the particular tube (remaining digits). For example, the ECC83 (equivalent to the 12AX7) is a 6.3V (E) double triode (CC) with a miniature base (8). In this system special-quality tubes (e.g., for long-life computer use) are indicated by moving the number immediately after the first letter: the E83CC is a special-quality equivalent of the ECC83, the E55L a power pentode with no consumer equivalent.

==Special-purpose tubes==
[[File:5651RegulatorTubeInOperation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Voltage-regulator tube in operation. Low pressure gas within tube glows due to current flow.]]
Some special-purpose tubes are constructed with particular gases in the envelope. For instance, [[voltage-regulator tube]]s contain various [[inert gas]]es such as [[argon]], [[helium]] or [[neon]], which will [[Ionization|ionize]] at predictable voltages. The [[thyratron]] is a special-purpose tube filled with low-pressure gas or mercury vapor. Like vacuum tubes, it contains a hot cathode and an anode, but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode. When the control electrode starts conduction, the gas ionizes, after which the control electrode can no longer stop the current; the tube "latches" into conduction. Removing anode (plate) voltage lets the gas de-ionize, restoring its non-conductive state.

Some thyratrons can carry large currents for their physical size. One example is the miniature type 2D21, often seen in 1950s [[jukebox]]es as control switches for [[relay]]s. A cold-cathode version of the thyratron, which uses a pool of mercury for its cathode, is called an [[ignitron]]; some can switch thousands of amperes. Thyratrons containing hydrogen have a very consistent time delay between their turn-on pulse and full conduction; they behave much like modern [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s, also called [[thyristor]]s due to their functional similarity to thyratrons. Hydrogen thyratrons have long been used in radar transmitters.

A specialized tube is the [[krytron]], which is used for rapid high-voltage switching. Krytrons are used to initiate the detonations used to set off a [[nuclear weapon]]; krytrons are heavily controlled at an international level.

[[X-ray tube]]s are used in medical imaging among other uses. X-ray tubes used for continuous-duty operation in fluoroscopy and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT imaging]] equipment may use a focused cathode and a rotating anode to dissipate the large amounts of heat thereby generated. These are housed in an oil-filled aluminium housing to provide cooling.

The [[photomultiplier]] tube is an extremely sensitive detector of light, which uses the [[photoelectric effect]] and [[secondary emission]], rather than thermionic emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and [[liquid scintillation counting|liquid scintillation counters]] use photomultiplier tube arrays to detect low-intensity [[Scintillation counter|scintillation]] due to [[ionizing radiation]].

==Powering the tube==

===Batteries===

{{main|Battery (vacuum tube)}}

[[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]] provided the voltages required by tubes in early radio sets. Three different voltages were generally required, using three different batteries designated as the '''A''', '''B''', and '''C''' battery. The [[A battery|"A" battery]] or LT (low-tension) battery provided the filament voltage. Tube heaters were designed for single, double or triple-cell [[lead–acid battery|lead-acid]] batteries, giving nominal heater voltages of 2 V, 4 V or 6 V. In portable radios, dry batteries were sometimes used with 1.5 or 1 V heaters. Reducing filament consumption improved the life span of batteries. By 1955 towards the end of the tube era, tubes using only 50 mA down to as little as 10 mA for the heaters had been developed.&lt;ref name=Okamura94&gt;{{cite book|first=Sōgo|last=Okamura|title=History of electron tubes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=9 May 2011|date=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-90-5199-145-1|pages=133–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622234430/http://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;pg=PA133|archivedate=22 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high voltage applied to the anode (plate) was provided by the [[B battery|"B" battery]] or the HT (high-tension) supply or battery. These were generally of [[dry cell]] construction and typically came in 22.5-, 45-, 67.5-, 90-, 120- or 135-volt versions.

[[File:C Battery circuit of a Triode vacuum tube.png|thumb|right| Batteries for a vacuum tube circuit. The C battery is highlighted.]]
Early sets used a grid bias battery or [[GB Battery|"C" battery]] which was connected to provide a ''negative'' voltage. Since virtually no current flows through a tube's grid connection, these batteries had very low drain and lasted the longest. Even after AC power supplies became commonplace, some radio sets continued to be built with C batteries, as they would almost never need replacing. However more modern circuits were designed using [[cathode bias]]ing, eliminating the need for a third power supply voltage; this became practical with tubes using indirect heating of the cathode.

The "C battery" for bias is a designation having no relation to the "[[C battery|C cell]]" [[List of battery sizes|battery size]].

===AC power===
{{Redirect|Cheater cord|the three-prong to two-prong mains plug adapter|Cheater plug}}
Battery replacement was a major operating cost for early radio receiver users. The development of the [[battery eliminator]], and, in 1925, [[Batteryless radio|batteryless receivers]] operated by [[Mains electricity|household power]], reduced operating costs and contributed to the growing popularity of radio. A [[power supply]] using a [[transformer]] with several windings, one or more [[rectifier]]s (which may themselves be vacuum tubes), and large filter [[electrolytic capacitor|capacitor]]s  provided the required [[direct current]] voltages from the alternating current source.

As a cost reduction measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current and with a similar warm-up time. In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called [[AC/DC receiver design]]. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname [[All American Five]].

Where the mains voltage was in the 100-120V range, this limited voltage proved suitable only for low-power receivers. Television receivers either required a transformer or could use a [[voltage doubler|voltage doubling]] circuit. Where 230 V nominal mains voltage was used, television receivers as well could dispense with a power transformer.

Transformer-less power supplies required safety precautions in their design to limit the shock hazard to users, such as electrically insulated cabinets and an [[Interlock (engineering)|interlock]] tying the power cord to the cabinet back, so the line cord was necessarily disconnected if the user or service person opened the cabinet. A ''cheater cord'' was a power cord ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed.

To avoid the warm-up delay, "instant on" television receivers passed a small heating current through their tubes even when the set was nominally off. At switch on, full heating current was provided and the set would play almost immediately.

==Reliability==
[[File:Acremeter tube tester.jpg|thumb|upright|Tube tester manufactured in 1930]]
One reliability problem of tubes with oxide cathodes is the possibility that the cathode may slowly become "[[cathode poisoning|poisoned]]" by gas molecules from other elements in the tube, which reduce its ability to emit electrons. Trapped gases or slow gas leaks can also damage the cathode or cause plate (anode) current runaway due to [[ionization]] of free gas molecules. [[Vacuum]] hardness and proper selection of construction materials are the major influences on tube lifetime. Depending on the material, temperature and construction, the surface material of the cathode may also diffuse onto other elements. The resistive heaters that heat the cathodes may break in a manner similar to [[incandescent lamp]] filaments, but rarely do, since they operate at much lower temperatures than lamps.

The heater's failure mode is typically a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or at a weld point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a [[thermistor]], may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage equal to that of the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.

Following World War II, tubes intended to be used in series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.

Another important reliability problem is caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually [[oxygen]] in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as [[Cunife]] and [[Fernico]]) and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These made it easy to construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes.

When a vacuum tube is overloaded or operated past its design dissipation, its anode (plate) may glow red. In consumer equipment, a [[glowing plate]] is universally a sign of an overloaded tube. However, some large transmitting tubes are designed to operate with their anodes at red, orange, or in rare cases, white heat.

"Special quality" versions of standard tubes were often made, designed for improved performance in some respect, such as a longer life cathode, low noise construction, mechanical ruggedness via ruggedized filaments, low microphony, for applications where the tube will spend much of its time cut off, etc. The only way to know the particular features of a special quality part is by reading the data sheet. Names may reflect the standard name (12AU7==&gt;12AU7A, its equivalent ECC82==&gt;E82CC, etc.), or be absolutely anything (standard and special-quality equivalents of the same tube include 12AU7, ECC82, B329, CV491, E2163, E812CC, M8136, CV4003, 6067, VX7058, 5814A and 12AU7A).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/addtext/add070.htm National Valve Museum: audio double triodes ECC81, 2, and 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107063504/http://r-type.org/addtext/add070.htm |date=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest recorded valve life was earned by a Mazda AC/P pentode valve (serial No. 4418) in operation at the [[BBC]]'s main Northern Ireland transmitter at Lisnagarvey. The valve was in service from 1935 until 1961 and had a recorded life of 232,592 hours. The BBC maintained meticulous records of their valves' lives with periodic returns to their central valve stores.&lt;ref&gt;Certified by BBC central valve stores, Motspur Park&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazda Data Booklet 1968 Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vacuum===
[[File:Getter diagram.png|thumb|right|350px|Getter in opened tube; silvery deposit from getter]]
[[File:Opachki dead vacuum luminescent display bednyaga da.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Dead vacuum fluorescent display (air has leaked in and the getter spot has become white)]]
A vacuum tube needs an extremely good ("hard") vacuum to avoid the consequences of generating positive ions within the tube. With a small amount of residual gas, some of those atoms may [[Ionization|ionize]] when struck by an electron and create fields that adversely affect the tube characteristics. Larger amounts of residual gas can create a self-sustaining visible [[glow discharge]] between the tube elements.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} To avoid these effects, the residual pressure within the tube must be low enough that the [[mean free path]] of an electron is much longer than the size of the tube (so an electron is unlikely to strike a residual atom and very few ionized atoms will be present). Commercial vacuum tubes are evacuated at manufacture to about {{convert|0.000001|mmHg|Torr uPa mbar atm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;C. Robert Meissner (ed.), ''Vacuum Technology Transactions: Proceedings of the Sixth National Symposium'', Elsevier, 2016,{{ISBN|1483223558}} page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent gases from compromising the tube's vacuum, modern tubes are constructed with "[[getter]]s", which are usually small, circular troughs filled with metals that oxidize quickly, [[barium]] being the most common. While the tube envelope is being evacuated, the internal parts except the getter are heated by [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[induction heating]] to evolve any remaining gas from the metal parts. The tube is then sealed and the getter is heated to a high temperature, again by radio frequency induction heating, which causes the getter material to vaporize and react with any residual gas. The vapor is deposited on the inside of the glass envelope, leaving a silver-colored metallic patch which continues to absorb small amounts of gas that may leak into the tube during its working life. Great care is taken with the valve design to ensure this material is not deposited on any of the working electrodes. If a tube develops a serious leak in the envelope, this deposit turns a white color as it reacts with atmospheric [[oxygen]]. Large transmitting and specialized tubes often use more exotic getter materials, such as [[zirconium]]. Early gettered tubes used phosphorus-based getters, and these tubes are easily identifiable, as the phosphorus leaves a characteristic orange or rainbow deposit on the glass. The use of phosphorus was short-lived and was quickly replaced by the superior barium getters. Unlike the barium getters, the phosphorus did not absorb any further gases once it had fired.

Getters act by chemically combining with residual or infiltrating gases, but are unable to counteract (non-reactive) inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as [[cathode ray tube]]s and camera tubes such as [[iconoscope]]s, [[orthicon]]s, and [[image orthicons]], comes from helium infiltration.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and resealing), and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused ("New Old Stock") tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, so there is no long-term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.

===Transmitting tubes===

Large transmitting tubes have carbonized [[tungsten]] filaments containing a small trace (1% to 2%)  of [[thorium]]. An extremely thin (molecular) layer of thorium atoms forms on the outside of the wire's carbonized layer and, when heated, serve as an efficient source of electrons. The thorium slowly evaporates from the wire surface, while new thorium atoms [[diffusion|diffuse]] to the surface to replace them. Such thoriated tungsten cathodes usually deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours. The end-of-life scenario for a thoriated-tungsten filament is when the carbonized layer has mostly been converted back into another form of [[tungsten carbide]] and emission begins to drop off rapidly; a complete loss of thorium has never been found to be a factor in the end-of-life in a tube with this type of emitter.
[[WAAY-TV]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] achieved 163,000 hours (18.6 years) of service from an [[Eimac]] external cavity klystron in the visual circuit of its transmitter; this is the highest documented service life for this type of tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=31 Alumni|title=The Klystron &amp; Cactus|url=http://31alumni.com/klystron-cactus.htm|accessdate=29 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820054802/http://31alumni.com/klystron-cactus.htm|archivedate=20 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been said{{who|date=November 2010}} that transmitters with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do. While it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approximately 20 kilowatts, vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid-state circuits, this is no longer the case, especially in medium wave (AM broadcast) service where solid-state transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast transmitters with solid-state power amplifiers up to approximately 15&amp;nbsp;kW also show better overall power efficiency than tube-based power amplifiers.

===Receiving tubes===
Cathodes in small "receiving" tubes are coated with a mixture of [[barium oxide]] and [[strontium oxide]], sometimes with addition of [[calcium oxide]] or [[aluminium oxide]]. An electric heater is inserted into the cathode sleeve, and insulated from it electrically by a coating of aluminium oxide. This complex construction causes barium and strontium atoms to diffuse to the surface of the cathode and emit electrons when heated to about 780 degrees Celsius.

===Failure modes===

====Catastrophic failures====
A catastrophic failure is one which suddenly makes the vacuum tube unusable. A crack in the glass envelope will allow air into the tube and destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; tube sockets must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or other object presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high-voltage arcing.

Tube heaters may also fail without warning, especially if exposed to over voltage or as a result of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like [[incandescent light bulb|lamp]] filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of [[inrush current]] when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC [[thermistor]] included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.

[[Electric arc|Arcing]] between tube elements can destroy the tube. An arc can be caused by applying voltage to the anode (plate) before the cathode has come up to operating temperature, or by drawing excess current through a rectifier, which damages the emission coating. Arcs can also be initiated by any loose material inside the tube, or by excess screen voltage. An arc inside the tube allows gas to evolve from the tube materials, and may deposit conductive material on internal insulating spacers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Robert B. |last=Tomer |title=Getting the most out of vacuum tubes |publisher=Howard W. Sams |location=Indianapolis, IN, USA |date=1960 |lccn=60-13843}}. available on the Internet Archive. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Tube rectifiers have limited current capability and exceeding ratings will eventually destroy a tube.

====Degenerative failures====
Degenerative failures are those caused by the slow deterioration of performance over time.

Overheating of internal parts, such as control grids or mica spacer insulators, can result in trapped gas escaping into the tube; this can reduce performance. A [[getter]] is used to absorb gases evolved during tube operation, but has only a limited ability to combine with gas. Control of the envelope temperature prevents some types of gassing. A tube with an unusually high level of internal gas may exhibit a visible blue glow when plate voltage is applied. The getter (being a highly reactive metal) is effective against many atmospheric gases, but has no (or very limited) chemical reactivity to inert gases such as helium. One progressive type of failure, especially with physically large envelopes such as those used by camera tubes and cathode-ray tubes, comes from helium infiltration. The exact mechanism is not clear: the metal-to-glass lead-in seals are one possible infiltration site.

Gas and ions within the tube contribute to grid current which can disturb operation of a vacuum tube circuit. Another effect of overheating is the slow deposit of metallic vapors on internal spacers, resulting in inter-element leakage.

Tubes on standby for long periods, with heater voltage applied, may develop high cathode interface resistance and display poor emission characteristics. This effect occurred especially in pulse and [[digital circuit]]s, where tubes had no plate current flowing for extended times. Tubes designed specifically for this mode of operation were made.

Cathode depletion is the loss of emission after thousands of hours of normal use. Sometimes emission can be restored for a time by raising heater voltage, either for a short time or a permanent increase of a few percent. Cathode depletion was uncommon in signal tubes but was a frequent cause of failure of monochrome television [[cathode-ray tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomer|1960|loc=60, chapter 2}}&lt;!-- 60 might mean 1960--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Usable life of this expensive component was sometimes extended by fitting a boost transformer to increase heater voltage.

====Other failures====
Vacuum tubes may develop defects in operation that make an individual tube unsuitable in a given device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. ''[[Microphonics]]'' refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; sound or vibration pick-up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from the ends of the heater may also inject [[Mains hum|hum]] into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomer|1960|loc=60, chapter 3}}&lt;!-- 60 might mean 1960 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use, although unobjectionable for other purposes. Selecting the best of a batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results.

Tube pins can develop non-conducting or high resistance surface films due to heat or dirt. Pins can be cleaned to restore conductance.

==Testing==
[[File:VacuumTubeTester TV-7D 4.jpg|thumb|Universal vacuum tube tester]]
{{main|Tube tester}}
Vacuum tubes can be tested outside of their circuitry using a vacuum tube tester.

==Other vacuum tube devices==
Most small signal vacuum tube devices have been superseded by semiconductors, but some vacuum tube electronic devices are still in common use. The magnetron is the type of tube used in all [[microwave oven]]s. In spite of the advancing state of the art in power semiconductor technology, the vacuum tube still has reliability and cost advantages for high-frequency RF power generation.

Some tubes, such as [[magnetron]]s, [[traveling-wave tube]]s, [[carcinotron]]s, and [[klystron]]s, combine magnetic and electrostatic effects. These are efficient (usually narrow-band) RF generators and still find use in [[radar]], [[microwave oven]]s and industrial heating. Traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) are very good amplifiers and are even used in some communications satellites. High-powered klystron amplifier tubes can provide hundreds of kilowatts in the UHF range.

===Cathode ray tubes===
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
{{main|Cathode ray tube}}
The [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) is a vacuum tube used particularly for display purposes. Although there are still many televisions and computer monitors using cathode ray tubes, they are rapidly being replaced by [[flat panel display]]s whose quality has greatly improved even as their prices drop. This is also true of digital [[oscilloscope]]s (based on internal computers and [[analog to digital converter]]s), although  traditional analog scopes (dependent upon CRTs) continue to be produced, are economical, and preferred by many technicians.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} At one time many radios used "[[magic eye tube]]s", a specialized sort of CRT used in place of a [[Galvanometer|meter movement]] to indicate signal strength, or input level in a tape recorder. A modern indicator device, the [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (VFD) is also a sort of cathode ray tube.

The [[X-ray tube]] is a type of cathode ray tube that generates X-rays when high voltage electrons hit the anode.

[[Gyrotron]]s or vacuum masers, used to generate high-power millimeter band waves, are magnetic vacuum tubes in which a small [[relativity (physics)|relativistic]] effect, due to the high voltage, is used for bunching the electrons. Gyrotrons can generate very high powers (hundreds of kilowatts).
[[Free-electron laser]]s, used to generate high-power coherent light and even [[X-ray]]s, are highly relativistic vacuum tubes driven by high-energy particle accelerators. Thus, these are sorts of cathode ray tubes.

===Electron multipliers===
A [[photomultiplier]] is a [[phototube]] whose sensitivity is greatly increased through the use of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of [[secondary emission]], whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a [[dynode]] causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of [[ionizing radiation]] as an alternative to the [[Geiger–Müller tube]] (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.

For decades, electron-tube designers tried to augment amplifying tubes with electron multipliers in order to increase gain, but these suffered from short life because the material used for the dynodes "poisoned" the tube's hot cathode. (For instance, the interesting RCA 1630 secondary-emission tube was marketed, but did not last.) However, eventually, Philips of the Netherlands developed the EFP60 tube that had a satisfactory lifetime, and was used in at least one product, a laboratory pulse generator. By that time, however, transistors were rapidly improving, making such developments superfluous.

One variant called a "channel electron multiplier" does not use individual dynodes but consists of a curved tube, such as a helix, coated on the inside with material with good secondary emission. One type had a funnel of sorts to capture the secondary electrons. The continuous dynode was resistive, and its ends were connected to enough voltage to create repeated cascades of electrons. The [[microchannel plate]] consists of an array of single stage electron multipliers over an image plane; several of these can then be stacked. This can be used, for instance, as an [[image intensifier]] in which the discrete channels substitute for focussing.

Tektronix made a high-performance wideband oscilloscope CRT with a channel electron multiplier plate behind the phosphor layer. This plate was a bundled array of a huge number of short individual c.e.m. tubes that accepted a low-current beam and intensified it to provide a display of practical brightness. (The electron optics of the wideband electron gun could not provide enough current to directly excite the phosphor.)

==Vacuum tubes in the 21st century==

===Niche applications===
Although vacuum tubes have been largely replaced by [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices in most amplifying, switching, and rectifying applications, there are certain exceptions. In addition to the special functions noted above, tubes {{As of|2011|alt=still}} have some niche applications.

In general, vacuum tubes are much less susceptible than corresponding solid-state components to transient overvoltages, such as mains voltage surges or lightning, the [[electromagnetic pulse]] effect of [[nuclear explosion]]s,&lt;ref name=chaos&gt;Broad, William J. "Nuclear Pulse (I): Awakening to the Chaos Factor", Science. 29 May 1981 212: 1009–1012&lt;/ref&gt; or [[geomagnetic storm]]s produced by giant solar flares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1549/2 Y Butt, The Space Review, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422222217/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1549/2 |date=22 April 2012 }} "... geomagnetic storms, on occasion, can induce more powerful pulses than the E3 pulse from even megaton type nuclear weapons."&lt;/ref&gt; This property kept them in use for certain military applications long after more practical and less expensive solid-state technology was available for the same applications, as for example with the [[MiG-25]].&lt;ref name=chaos/&gt; In that aircraft, output power of the radar is about one kilowatt and it can burn through a channel under interference.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Vacuum tubes are still{{when|date=May 2018}} practical alternatives to solid-state devices in generating high power at [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] in applications such as [[Dielectric heating|industrial radio frequency heating]], [[particle accelerator]]s, and [[Valve transmitters|broadcast transmitters]]. This is particularly true at microwave frequencies where such devices as the [[klystron]] and [[traveling-wave tube]] provide amplification at power levels unattainable using {{As of|2011|alt=current}} semiconductor devices. The household [[microwave oven]] uses a [[magnetron]] tube to efficiently generate hundreds of watts of microwave power.

In military applications, a high-power vacuum tube can generate a 10–100&amp;nbsp;megawatt signal that can burn out an unprotected receiver's frontend. Such devices are considered non-nuclear electromagnetic weapons; they were introduced in the late 1990s by both the U.S. and Russia.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Enough people prefer [[tube sound]] to make tube amplifiers commercially viable in three areas: musical instrument (e.g., guitar) amplifiers, devices used in recording studios, and [[audiophile]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The cool sound of tubes – vacuum tube musical applications|last=Barbour|first=E.|journal=Spectrum, IEEE|volume=35|number=8|pages=24–35|date=1998|publisher=IEEE|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/the-cool-sound-of-tubes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104040533/http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/the-cool-sound-of-tubes|archivedate=4 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many guitarists prefer using [[valve amplifier]]s to solid-state models, often due to the way they tend to distort when overdriven. Any amplifier can only accurately amplify a signal to a certain volume; past this limit, the amplifier will begin to distort the signal. Different circuits will distort the signal in different ways; some guitarists prefer the distortion characteristics of vacuum tubes. Most popular vintage models use vacuum tubes.

===Vacuum fluorescent display===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
{{Main|Vacuum fluorescent display}}
[[File:Vacuum fluorescent 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Typical VFD used in a [[videocassette recorder]]]]
A modern display technology using a variation of cathode ray tube is often used in [[videocassette recorder]]s, DVD players and recorders, microwave oven control panels,  and automotive dashboards. Rather than [[raster scanning]], these [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFD) switch control grids and anode voltages on and off, for instance, to display discrete characters. The VFD uses [[phosphor]]-coated anodes as in other display cathode ray tubes. Because the filaments are in view, they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly. This is possible using more recent cathode technology, and these tubes also operate with quite low anode voltages (often less than 50 volts) unlike cathode ray tubes. Their high brightness allows reading the display in bright daylight. VFD tubes are flat and rectangular, as well as relatively thin. Typical VFD phosphors emit a broad spectrum of greenish-white light, permitting use of color filters, though different phosphors can give other colors even within the same display. The design of these tubes provides a bright glow despite the low energy of the incident electrons. This is because the distance between the cathode and anode is relatively small. (This technology is distinct from [[fluorescent light]]ing, which uses a [[discharge tube]].)

In the early years of the 21st century there has been renewed interest in vacuum tubes, this time with the electron emitter formed on a flat silicon substrate, as in [[integrated circuit]] technology. This subject is now called vacuum nanoelectronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ackerman|first=Evan|title=Vacuum tubes could be the future of computing|url=http://www.dvice.com/archives/2012/05/vacuum-tubes-co.php|work=Dvice|publisher=Dvice|accessdate=8 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325192121/http://www.dvice.com/archives/2012/05/vacuum-tubes-co.php|archivedate=25 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common design uses a [[cold cathode]] in the form of a [[field electron emission|large-area field electron source]] (for example a [[field emitter array]]).
