'''Accounting ethics''' is primarily a field of [[applied ethics]] and is part of [[business ethics]] and human [[ethics]], the study of [[moral value]]s and judgments as they apply to [[accountancy]]. It is an example of [[professional ethics]]. Accounting introduced by [[Luca Pacioli]], and later expanded by government groups, professional organizations, and independent companies. Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training [[accountant]]s and [[audit]]ors.

Due to the diverse range of accounting services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackling|first=Beverly|author2=Barry J.

==Importance of ethics==
The nature of the work carried out by accountants and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment.&lt;ref name="FinReportShare"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=David|author2=Anne Britton|title=Financial Reporting|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|year=2004|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1OUTXGDWeWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|isbn=1-84480-033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company.&lt;ref name="AccAudRely"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=David|title='Auditors Are Timid'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KesNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QHADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2763,4354640&amp;dq=investors+rely+on+accountants+auditors|date=April 26, 2002|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.&lt;ref name="AcctEthicsBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duska|first=Ronald F.|author2=Brenda Shay Duska|title=Accounting Ethics|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y4LgVJgynCsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Accounting+Ethics|isbn=0-631-21651-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries have differing focuses on enforcing accounting laws. In Germany, accounting legislation is governed by "tax law"; in Sweden, by "accounting law"; and in the United Kingdom, by the "[[United Kingdom company law|company law]]". In addition, countries have their own organizations which regulate accounting. For example, Sweden has the Bokföringsnämden (BFN - Accounting Standards Board), Spain the Instituto de Comtabilidad y Auditoria de Cuentas (ICAC), and the United States the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB).&lt;ref name="EthicalIssuesAcct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gowthorpe|first=Catherine|author2=John Blake|title=Ethical Issues in Accounting|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=7|isbn=0-415-17173-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A painting of two men. The man at the center is looking off to his right while drawing a symbol with his right hand. His left hand is resting on a page in a book. He is wearing a robe with a hood. The man on the right is looking towards the front and is wearing a long-sleeve red shirt with a black jacket. Several writing utensils and books are on a table with a green tablecloth in the front of the image.|Luca Pacioli, here in [[Portrait of Luca Pacioli|a 1495 portrait by an unknown Renaissance artist]], wrote on accounting ethics in 1494.]]
[[Luca Pacioli]], the "Father of Accounting", wrote on accounting ethics in his first book {{lang|la|[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni, et proportionalita]]}}, published in 1494.&lt;ref name="PacioliEthics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=L.

These various groups have led accountants to follow several codes of ethics to perform their duties in a professional work environment. Accountants must follow the code of ethics set out by the professional body of which they are a member. United States accounting societies such as the [[Association of Government Accountants]], [[Institute of Internal Auditors]], and the National Association of Accountants all have codes of ethics, and many accountants are members of one or more of these societies.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeb|first=Stephen E.|title=Teaching Students Accounting Ethics: Some Crucial Issues|journal=Issues in Accounting Education|volume=3|pages=316–329|date=Fall 1988|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=7569002&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=7&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA) was created; it was the first step in developing professionalism in the United States accounting industry.&lt;ref name="EvolutionEthics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casler|first=Darwin J.|title=The Evolution of CPA Ethics: A Profile of Professionalization|publisher=[[Michigan State University]]|year=1964|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905, the AAPA's first ethical codes were formulated to educate its members.&lt;ref name="CriticalPerspectives209"&gt;{{cite book|editor=J. Edward Ketz|title=Accounting Ethics: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management|last=Preston|first=Alistair M.|author2=David J. Cooper|author3= D. Paul Scarbrough|author4=Robert C.

As a result of discussions, a list of professional ethics was incorporated into the organization's bylaws. However, because membership to the organization was voluntary, the association could not require individuals to conform to the suggested behaviors.&lt;ref name="EvolutionEthics"/&gt; Other accounting organizations, such as the Illinois Institute of Accountants, also pursued discussion on the importance of ethics for the field.&lt;ref name="IllInsEthics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bookkeepers Repel Inference That Their Own Employers Were Aimed At.|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/403309611.html?dids=403309611:403309611&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+28%2C+1907&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=DISCUSS+ACCOUNTING+ETHICS.&amp;pqatl=google|format = Fee required|accessdate=December 14, 2010|date=February 28, 1907|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAPA was renamed several times throughout its history, before becoming the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) as it's named today. The AICPA developed five divisions of ethical principles that its members should follow: "independence, integrity, and objectivity"; "competence and technical standards"; "responsibilities to clients"; "responsibilities to colleagues"; as well as "other responsibilities and practices".&lt;ref name="Perceptions5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sellers|first=James H.|title=Accounting Student Perceptions of Business and Professional Ethics|publisher=[[University of Mississippi]]|year=1981|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these divisions provided guidelines on how a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) should act as a professional. Failure to comply with the guidelines could have caused an accountant to be barred from practicing. When developing the ethical principles, the AICPA also considered how the profession would be viewed by those outside of the accounting industry.&lt;ref name="Perceptions5"/&gt;

==Teaching ethics==
Courses on this subject have grown significantly in the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="EthicsPays"/&gt; Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt; Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way.&lt;ref name="LoebResearch4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeb|first=Stephen E.|title=Issues Relating to Teaching Accounting Ethics: An 18 Year Retrospective|journal=Research and Professional Responsibility and Ethics in Accounting|volume=11|page=4|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bW5PXF3I0HwC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22accounting+ethics%22#PPA4,M1|isbn=978-0-7623-1367-9|accessdate=May 14, 2009|doi=10.1016/s1574-0765(06)11001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at [[Binghamton University]].&lt;ref name="AnonCenterEthics"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=First Center to Study Accounting Ethics Opens|journal=Journal of Accountancy|volume=176|issue=4|page=19|date=October 1993|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=558663&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|CPA exam]].&lt;ref name="LoebResearch4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeasy.com/ethics-cpe-courses/index.aspx "State Regulatory Accounting Ethics"] retrieved April 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=35em|bgcolor=|quote='''Seven goals of accounting ethics education'''
*Relate accounting education to moral issues.
*Recognize issues in accounting that have ethical implications.
*Develop "a sense of moral obligation" or responsibility.
*Develop the abilities needed to deal with ethical conflicts or dilemmas.
*Learn to deal with the uncertainties of the accounting profession.
*"Set the stage for" a change in ethical behavior.
*Appreciate and understand the history and composition of all aspects of accounting ethics and their relationship to the general field of ethics. —Stephen E. Loeb&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;}}

In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb proposed that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted from a list by Daniel Callahan).&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt; To implement these goals, he pointed out that accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;

There has been debate on whether ethics should be taught in a university setting. Supporters point out that ethics are important to the profession, and should be taught to accountants entering the field.&lt;ref name="ForgotStake"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernardi|first=Richard A.|author2=David F.

Phillip G. Cottel argued that in order to uphold strong ethics, an accountant "must have a strong sense of values, the ability to reflect on a situation to determine the ethical implications, and a commitment to the well-being of others."&lt;ref name="PracticalGuideProf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cottel|first=Philip G.|title=Accounting Ethics: A Practical Guide for Professionals|publisher=Quorum Books|year=1990|pages=78&amp;ndash;79|isbn=0-89930-401-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iris Stuart recommends an ethics model consisting of four steps: the accountant must recognize that an ethical dilemma is occurring; identify the parties that would be interested in the outcome of the dilemma; determine alternatives and evaluate its effect on each alternative on the interested parties; and then select the best alternative.&lt;ref name="PostEnronAge6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stuart|first=Iris|title=Ethics in the Post-Enron Age|publisher=SouthWestern/Thomson|year=2004|page=6|isbn=0-324-19193-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting scandals==
{{main|Accounting scandals}}
Accounting ethics has been deemed difficult to control as accountants and auditors must consider the interest of the public (which relies on the information gathered in audits) while ensuring that they remained employed by the company they are auditing.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJWhatYouLike"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Lee|title=Goal: Ethical Standards for Accounting Practices|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=27058245&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|date=May 24, 1984|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They must consider how to best apply accounting standards even when faced with issues that could cause a company to face a significant loss or even be discontinued. Due to several accounting scandals within the profession, critics of accountants have stated that when asked by a client "what does two plus two equal?" the accountant would be likely to respond "what would you like it to be?".&lt;ref name="WSJWhatYouLike"/&gt; This thought process along with other criticisms of the profession's issues with conflict of interest, have led to various increased standards of professionalism while stressing ethics in the work environment.

The role of accountants is critical to society. Accountants serve as financial reporters and
intermediaries in the capital markets and owe their primary obligation to the public interest. The
information they provide is crucial in aiding managers, investors and others in making critical economic
decisions. Accordingly, ethical improprieties by accountants can be detrimental to society, resulting in
distrust by the public and disruption of efficient capital market operations.

}}
From the 1980s to the present there have been multiple accounting scandals that were widely reported on by the media and resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of [[creative accounting]], misleading [[financial analysis]], as well as [[bribe]]ry. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including [[Nugan Hand Bank#Scandal and collapse|Nugan Hand Bank]], [[Phar-Mor#Bankruptcy|Phar-Mor]], [[WorldCom#Accounting scandals|WorldCom]], and [[American International Group#Accounting fraud claims|AIG]]. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved [[Enron]], a multinational company, that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor [[Arthur Andersen]], an accounting firm considered one of the "[[Big Four auditors|Big Five]]", signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements.&lt;ref name="AASignOff"&gt;{{cite news|title=Auditors: In the palm of the banks?|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5580824.ece|date=January 25, 2009|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=June 18, 2009 | location=London | first1=Iain | last1=Dey | first2=Dominic | last2=Rushe}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the unethical activities were reported, not only did Enron dissolve but Arthur Andersen also went out of business.

===Causes===
Fraudulent accounting can arise from a variety of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's [[corporate culture]] as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior.&lt;ref name="ClikeTrust"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clikeman|first=Paul M.|title=Educating for the Public Trust|journal=The CPA Journal|volume=73|issue=8|page=80|date=August 2003|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=407305991&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511003019/http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=407305991&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleClimate"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Appelbaum|first=Steven H.|author2=Kyle J Deguire |author3=Mathieu Lay|title=The Relationship of Ethical Climate to Deviant Workplace Behaviour|journal=Corporate Governance|volume=5|issue=4|pages=43–55|year=2005|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=914821791&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=4&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 8, 2009| doi=10.1108/14720700510616587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt;

Until 1977, ethics rules prevented accounting and auditing firms from advertising to clients. When the rules were lifted, spending by the largest CPA firms on advertisements rose from [[United States dollar|US$]]4 million in the 1980s to more than $100&amp;nbsp;million in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="CSTAdvertise"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Lee|title=Advertising has hurt accounting's ethics: critics|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1464160.html|format = Registration required|date=May 24, 1984|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that, by allowing the firms to advertise, the business side overstepped the professional side of the profession, which led to a conflict of interest. This focus allowed for occurrences of fraud, and caused the firms, according to Apj , "... to offer services that made them more consultants and business advisers than auditors."&lt;ref name="CSTAdvertise"/&gt; As accounting firms became less interested in the lower-paying audits due to more focus on higher earning services such as consulting, problems arose.&lt;ref name="WashPost1998"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crenshaw|first=Albert B.|author2=Brett D.

A 2007 article in ''Managerial Auditing Journal'' determined the top nine factors that contributed to ethical failures for accountants based on a survey of 66 members of the [[International Federation of Accountants]]. The factors include (in order of most significant): "self-interest, failure to maintain objectivity and independence, inappropriate professional judgment, lack of ethical sensitivity, improper leadership and ill-culture, failure to withstand advocacy threats, lack of competence, lack of organizational and peer support, and lack of professional body support."&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; The main factor, self-interest, is the motivation by an accountant to act in his/her best interest or when facing a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; For example, if an auditor has an issue with an account he/she is auditing, but is receiving financial incentives to ignore these issues, the auditor may act unethically.

The [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) are standards and interpretations developed by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]], which are principle-based.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scannell|first=Kara|author2=Joanna Slater|title=SEC Moves To Pull Plug On U.S. Accounting Standards|url=http://s.wsj.net/article/SB121985665095476825.html?mod=fpa_whatsnews|date=August 28, 2008|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511112508/http://s.wsj.net/article/SB121985665095476825.html?mod=fpa_whatsnews| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the [[European Union]], Australia, and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="IFRSList"&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of IFRSs by Jurisdiction|url=http://www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm#totals|date=March 24, 2009|publisher=[[International Financial Reporting Standards|IAS]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512150619/http://www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm| archivedate= 12 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"/&gt; Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is partly responsible for the number of scandals that the United States has suffered.&lt;ref name="BizJourBoil"/&gt; The principles-based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules-based approach.&lt;ref name="BennettRules"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=907368 |last=Bennett |first=Bruce |author2=Michael Bradbury |author3=Helen Pragnell |title=Rules, Principles and Judgments in Accounting Standards |journal=Abacus |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=189–203 |year=2006 |format=Registration required |ssrn=907368 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6281.2006.00197.x |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511192601/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=907368 |archivedate=11 May 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many stakeholders in many countries such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about the pros and cons of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segovia|first=Joann|title=Do Principles- vs. Rules-Based Standards Have a Differential Impact on U.S. Auditors' Decisions?|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1871151361&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=31810&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFRS is based on "understandability, relevance, materiality, reliability, and comparability".&lt;ref name="RRCUMIFRS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosen|first=Graeme|title=A Practical Guide to IFRS for Derivatives and Structured Finance|publisher=Euromoney Books|year=2006|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/?id=00Jco44doU0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=relevance,+reliability,+comparability,+understandability,+and+materiality+IFRS|isbn=1-84374-267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since IFRS has not been adopted by all countries, these practices do not make the international standards viable in the world domain. In particular, the United States has not yet conformed and still uses GAAP which makes comparing principles and rules difficult. In August 2008, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) proposed that the United States switch from GAAP to IFRS, starting in 2014.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"/&gt;

===Responses to scandals===
Since the major accounting scandals, new reforms, regulations, and calls for increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior.&lt;ref name="PerfReport17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnsson|first=Hans|author2=Per Erik Kihlstedt|title=Performance-Based Reporting|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2005|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T2sIinuZlHIC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22accounting+ethics%22|isbn=0-471-73543-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce, such as through higher education or initial training at companies, it is believed it will help to improve the credibility of the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="DellaDifference"/&gt; Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist professors in educating students.&lt;ref name="BizJourChampion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mader|first=Becca|title=Enron case causes colleges to champion accounting ethics|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/05/06/focus1.html|date=May 3, 2002|publisher=''[[The Business Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090523034641/http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/05/06/focus1.html| archivedate= 23 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New regulations in response to the scandals include the [[Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004]] in Australia as well as the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002, developed by the United States.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects [[whistleblower]]s and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's [[accounting records]]. In 2002, the five members of the [[Public Oversight Board]] (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB).&lt;ref name="5PCAOB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Labaton|first=Stephen|title=Accounting Ethics Panel Members Resign, Rejecting Sec Chief's Plan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YuwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M3ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3645,467306&amp;dq=accounting+ethics|date=January 23, 2002|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.&lt;ref name="ManagerialAcctBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilton|first=Ronald W.|title=Managerial Accounting: Creating Value in a Dynamic Business Environment|publisher=McGraw Hill/Irwin|location=Boston|edition=Sixth|year=2005|page=26|isbn=0-07-111314-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) released a report entitled ''Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective''.&lt;ref name="IFARebuild"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crow |first=John |author2=Christian Aubin |author3=Olivia Kirtley |author4=Kosuke Nakahira |author5=Ian Ramsay |author6=Guylaine Saucier |author7=Graham Ward |title=Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective |url=http://www.ifac.org/Credibility/ViewPoints_PubDL.php?PubID=00061 |format=PDF |date=August 2003 |publisher=[[International Federation of Accountants]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528233709/http://www.ifac.org/Credibility/ViewPoints_PubDL.php?PubID=00061 |archivedate=May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying the international company collapses as a result of accounting issues, it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt;
A collaborative effort by members of the international financial regulatory community led by [[Michel Prada]], Chairman of the French Financial Markets Authority, resulting in establishment of the [[Public Interest Oversight Board]] (PIOB) on 1 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The PIOB provides oversight of the IFAC standards-setting boards: the [[International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board]] (IAASB), the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) and the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most recent reform came into effect in July 2010 when President Obama signed "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act". The act covers a broad range of changes. The highlights of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends too big to fail bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, executive compensation and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710034423/http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf |date=2010-07-10 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The rewards are between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected.&lt;ref&gt;"Welcome to the Office of the Whistleblower." U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Home Page). Web. 31 Oct. 2011. &lt;https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on. The result is less harm to investors, quickly holding offenders responsible, and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets.

'''Agile manufacturing''' is a term applied to an organization that has created the processes, tools, and training to enable it to respond quickly to customer needs and market changes while still controlling costs and quality. 

An [[enabling factor]] in becoming an agile manufacturer has been the development of manufacturing support technology that allows the marketers, the designers and the production personnel to share a common database of parts and products, to share data on production capacities and problems&amp;mdash;particularly where small initial problems may have larger ''[[downstream (manufacturing)|downstream]]'' effects.  It is a general proposition of manufacturing that the cost of correcting quality issues increases as the problem moves downstream, so that it is cheaper to correct quality problems at the earliest possible point in the process.

Agile manufacturing is seen as the next step after [[lean manufacturing]] in the evolution of production methodology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The key difference between the two is like between a thin and an athletic person, agile being the latter. One can be neither, one or both. In manufacturing theory, being both is often referred to as leagile.
According to Martin Christopher, when companies have to decide what to be, they have to look at the customer order cycle (COC) (the time the customers are willing to wait) and the leadtime for getting supplies. If the supplier has a short lead time, lean production is possible. If the COC is short, agile production is beneficial.

Agile manufacturing is an approach to manufacturing which is focused on meeting the needs of customers while maintaining high standards of quality and controlling the overall costs involved in the production of a particular product. This approach is geared towards companies working in a highly competitive environment, where small variations in performance and product delivery can make a huge difference in the long term to a company's survival and reputation among consumers.

This concept is closely related to lean manufacturing, in which the goal is to reduce waste as much as possible. In lean manufacturing, the company aims to cut all costs which are not directly related to the production of a product for the consumer. Agile manufacturing can include this concept, but it also adds an additional dimension, the idea that customer demands need to be met rapidly and effectively. In situations where companies integrate both approaches, they are sometimes said to be using "agile and lean manufacturing".
Companies which utilize an agile manufacturing approach tend to have very strong networks with suppliers and related companies, along with numerous cooperative teams which work within the company to deliver products effectively. They can retool facilities quickly, negotiate new agreements with suppliers and other partners in response to changing market forces, and take other steps to meet customer demands. This means that the company can increase production on products with a high consumer demand, as well as redesign products to respond to issues which have emerged on the open market.

Markets can change very quickly, especially in the global economy. A company which cannot adapt quickly to change may find itself left behind, and once a company starts to lose market share, it can fall rapidly. The goal of agile manufacturing is to keep a company ahead of the competition so that consumers think of that company first, which allows it to continue innovating and introducing new products, because it is financially stable and it has a strong customer support base.

Companies that want to switch to the use of agile manufacturing can take advantage of consultants who specialize in helping companies convert and improve existing systems. Consultants can offer advice and assistance which is tailored to the industry a company is involved in, and they usually focus on making companies competitive as quickly as possible with proved agile techniques. There are also a number of textbooks and manuals available with additional information on agile manufacturing techniques and approaches.

'''Organizational ambidexterity''' refers to an organization's ability to be efficient in its [[management]] of today's business and also adaptable for coping with tomorrow's changing demand. Just as being [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] means being able to use both the left and right hand equally, organizational ambidexterity requires the organizations to use both [[exploration]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] techniques to be successful.

== Origin and development ==

Organizational ambidexterity was defined as an organization's ability to be aligned and efficient in its management of today's business demands as well as being [[adaptive]] to changes in the environment at the same time.&lt;ref name=duncan1976&gt;Duncan, R. (1976). ''The ambidextrous organization: Designing dual structures for innovation''. Killman, R. H., L. R. Pondy, and D. Sleven (eds.) The Management of Organization. New York: North Holland. 167-188.&lt;/ref&gt; This term of organizational ambidexterity was first used by Duncan,&lt;ref name=duncan1976/&gt; however, it was [[James G. March|March]]&lt;ref name=march1991&gt;March, J. G. (1991). Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning. ''Organization Science, 2'', 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; that had been credited for developing and generating greater interest in this concept, especially in the late 20th and early 21st century. [[Ambidexterity]] in an organization is achieved by balancing [[exploration]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], which allows the organization to be [[creativity|creative]] and [[Adaptability|adaptable]], while also continuing to rely on more traditional, proven methods of business.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt; [[Exploration]] includes things such as search, variation, [[Risk|risk taking]], [[experiment]]ation, [[Stiffness|flexibility]], discovery or [[innovation]], whereas exploitation includes such things as refinement, [[choice]], [[production (economics)|production]], [[efficiency]], [[Selection (biology)|selection]], [[implementation]], and [[execution]].&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt; Companies that focus only on exploration face the risk of wasting resources on ideas that may not prove useful or never be developed. On the other hand, companies that focus only on exploitation may accept [[status quo]] performance and products and fail to reach optimal levels of success.

Organizational ambidexterity is defined broadly, and several other terms are also highly related or similar to the construct of ambidextrous organization, including [[organizational learning]], technological innovation, organizational [[adaptation]], [[strategic management]], and [[Organizational structure|organizational design]]. Things such as reconciling exploitation and exploration, the [[simultaneity]] of induced and autonomous strategy processes, synchronizing incremental and discontinuous innovation, and balancing search and stability also tend to refer to the same underlying construct as ambidextrous organization.&lt;ref name=raisch2008&gt;Raisch, S., &amp; Birkinshaw, J. (2008). Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators. ''Journal of Management, 34'', 375-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are studies on how structural and behavioral mechanisms affect organizational ambidexterity and studies on how ambidextrous organizational designs affect organizational ambidexterity. Whereas earlier studies on structural and behavioral mechanisms regarded the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation to be insurmountable, more recent research has paid attention to a range of organizational solutions to engender the existence of ambidexterity. One recent hot research topic in this area focused on the [[leadership]] characteristics that enable organizations to manage the contradictions that they face and achieve ambidexterity,&lt;ref name=beckman2006&gt;Beckman, C. M. (2006). The influence of founding team company affiliations on firm behavior.  ''Academy of Management Journal, 49'', 741-758.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lubatkin2006&gt;Lubatkin, M. H., Simsek, Z., Ling, Y., &amp; Veiga, J. F. (2006). Ambidexterity and performance in small- to medium-sized firms: The pivotal role of top management team behavioral integration. ''Journal of Management, 32'', 646-672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith2005&gt;Smith, W. K., &amp; [[Tushman, M. L.]] (2005). Managing strategic contradictions: A top management model for managing innovation streams. ''Organization Science, 16'', 522-536.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the origin of the concept ‘ambidextrous leadership’. Several antecedents, outcomes of organizational ambidexterity as well as related moderators have also been identified in the studies on structural and behavioral mechanisms.

== Ambidextrous organizational designs and organizational ambidexyerity==

The studies on "ambidextrous organizations" take the organization as the unit of analysis and ambidextrous organizing is conceptualized as the simultaneous pursuit and combination of incremental and discontinuous innovation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization|title=The Ambidextrous Organization|date=2004-04-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=Michael|last2=O'Reilly|first2=C.|date=1997-01-15|title=Winning through Innovation: A Practical Guide to Leading Organizational Change and Renewal|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=200|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=M.|last2=Smith|first2=W.|date=2002-02-01|title=Organizational Technology: Technological Change, Ambidextrous Organizations and Organizational Evolution|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=11641|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ambidextrous organizations" are needed if the failure to balance exploitation and exploration is to be overcome: "the ability to pursue simultaneously both incremental and discontinuous innovation results from hosting multiple contradictory structures, processes, and cultures" (Tushman and O'Reilly, 1996: page 24).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=Michael|last2=O'Reilly|first2=C.|date=1996-07-01|title=Ambidextrous Organizations: Managing Evolutionary and Revolutionary Change|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=2045|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been empirically found that competence exploitation is negatively related to radical innovation performance whereas the effect for competence exploration is positive; competence exploration will be more valuable to the firm when it is matched with lower levels of competence exploitation, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atuahene-Gima|first=Kwaku|date=2005|title=Resolving the Capability: Rigidity Paradox in New Product Innovation|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30166552|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=69|issue=4|pages=61–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that the "ambidextrous organization" does not solve the tension between alignment and adaptability but allows for coping with the tension between different types of alignment in order to produce incremental and discontinuous innovation. "Ambidextrous organizations" do not alternate between exploration and exploitation, but they do both simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/ambidexterity-dynamic-capability-resolving-innovators-dilemma|title=Ambidexterity as a dynamic capability: Resolving the innovator’s dilemma|work=Stanford Graduate School of Business|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There's work that empirically investigates the processes of ambidextrous organizing by analyzing the implementation of the "ambidextrous organizations" concept in order to study whether there is evidence on how companies applying the concepts (suggested by "ambidextrous organizations" proponents) actually manage the processes of exploitation and exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durisin|first=Boris|last2=Todorova|first2=Gergana|date=2012-10-15|title=A Study of the Performativity of the “Ambidextrous Organizations” Theory: Neither Lost in nor Lost before Translation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2012.00981.x|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|language=en|volume=29|pages=53–75|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5885.2012.00981.x|issn=0737-6782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural and behavioral mechanisms that lead to organizational ambidexterity==

Organizational ambidexterity can be considered primarily from two angles. One is architectural or structural ambidexterity, which uses dual [[organizational structure]]s and strategies to differentiate efforts towards exploitation and exploration.&lt;ref name=adler1999&gt;Adler, P., Goldoftas, B., &amp; Levine, D. (1999). Flexibility versus efficiency? A case study of model changeovers in the Toyota production system. ''Organization Science, 10'', 43-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcdonough1983&gt;McDonough, E. F., &amp; Leifer, R. (1983). Using simultaneous structures to cope with uncertainty.  ''Academy of Management Journal, 26'', 727-735.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tushman1996&gt;[[Tushman, M. L.]], &amp; O’Reilly, C. A. (1996). Ambidextrous organizations: Managing evolutionary and revolutionary change. ''California Management Review, 38'', 8-30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Structural]] ambidexterity includes dual parts, with one part focusing on exploitation and the other focusing on exploration. It's also known as the spatial separation of the dual strategies concepts outlined above. The other approach is contextual ambidexterity, which uses [[behavioral]] and [[social]] means to integrate exploitation and exploration at the organizational unit level.&lt;ref name=gibson2004&gt;Gibson, C. B., &amp; Birkinshaw, J. (2004). The antecedents, consequences and mediating role of organizational ambidexterity.  ''Academy of Management Journal, 47'', 209-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarthy2011&gt;McCarthy, I.P., &amp; Gordon, B.R. (2011). Achieving Contextual Ambidexterity in R&amp;D Organizations: A Management Control System Approach. R&amp;D Management, 41, 240-258.&lt;/ref&gt; Contextual ambidexterity is a balanced type that takes a mid-level position between exploitation and exploration, also known as parallel structures or hybrid strategies.

Although both angles are related to the theme of organizational ambidexterity, they strongly differ in the way how they are configured. There has always been a debate of which of the two different approaches is right.  The dual type allows both discrete orientations and fit across dimensions at the unit level but creates a misfit between organizational units. Some researchers argued that inconsistent structures may lead to low performance.&lt;ref name=doty1986&gt;Doty, H. D., Glick, W. H., &amp; Huber, G. P. (1993). Fit, equifinality, and organizational effectiveness: A test of two configurational theories.

Generic strategies and performance: An empirical examination with American data Part I: Testing Porter.  ''Organization Studies, 7'', 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some researchers trying to investigate the external and internal [[Contingency theory|contingencies]] under which different configurations can be found. One factor would be the speed and type of [[technological change]] that organizations confront. On the other hand, the balanced type (i.e. contextual ambidexterity) is consistent with the systems approach of fit across multiple dimensions,&lt;ref name=drazin1985&gt;Drazin, R., &amp; Van de Ven, A. H. (1985). Alternative forms of fit in contingency theory. ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 30'', 514-539.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nadler1997&gt;Nadler, D., &amp; [[Tushman, M. L.]] (1997).

''Academy of Management Journal, 36'', 1175–1195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nickerson2002&gt;Nickerson, J. A., &amp; Zenger, T. R. (2002). Being efficiently fickle: A dynamic theory of organizational choice. ''Organization Science, 13'', 547-566.&lt;/ref&gt; In an environment where changes are slow, there will be sufficient time to react to the radical changes by constructing dual structures and strategies. However, in a high-competitive environment, balanced structures may be better prepared to deal with the constant need for alignment.&lt;ref name=raisch2008/&gt; In future studies, the different organizational ambidexterity configurations can be compared to find a better solution for dealing with the exploitation and exploration paradox.

==Antecedents of organizational ambidexterity==

Ambidexterity is often considered a capacity or skill and can therefore be facilitated by either the organization as a whole or managers / [[CEO]]s.&lt;ref name=cantarello2012&gt;Cantarello, S., Martini, A., &amp; Nosella, A. (2012). A multi-level model for organizational ambidexterity in the search phase of the innovation process. ''Creativity and Innovation Management, 21'', 28-48.&lt;/ref&gt; From the structural ambidexterity's view, organizations can solve the paradox by temporarily cycling through periods of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and periods of [[exploration]].&lt;ref name=nickerson2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=brown1998&gt;Brown, S. L., &amp; Eisenhardt, K. (1998). ''Competing on the edge: Strategy as structured chaos''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=siggelkow2003&gt;Siggelkow, N., &amp; Levinthal, D. A. (2003). Temporarily divide to conquer: Centralized, decentralized, and reintegrated organizational approaches to exploration and adaptation.  ''Organization Science, 14'', 650-669.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=venkatraman2007&gt;Venkatraman, N., Lee, C. H., &amp; Iyer, B. (2007). ''Strategic ambidexterity and sales growth: A longitudinal test in the software sector''. Unpublished Manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; From the other point of view (contextual ambidexterity), firms ought to address exploitation and exploration simultaneously and internally to achieve the goal ambidexterity.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; Contextual ambidexterity is more difficult to achieve than structural ambidexterity because managing two inconsistent alignments within an organization simultaneously is far more complex than managing one consistent strategy after another.&lt;ref name=gupta2006&gt;Gupta, A. K., Smith, K. G., &amp; Shalley, C. E. (2006). The interplay between exploration and exploitation. ''Academy of Management Journal, 4'', 693-706.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus most studies on how to build ambidextrous organizations in literature focused on contextual ambidexterity rather than structural ambidexterity.

The role of [[leadership|leaders]] (or managers) is always highlighted towards building an ambidextrous organization. Several recommendations have been made to organizations on how to achieve contextual ambidexterity, including using of meta-routines and [[Job enrichment|job-enrichment]] schemes,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; building [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] with supervisees,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; being supportive,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; using complex behavioral repertoires,&lt;ref name=denison1995&gt;Denison, D., Hooijberg, R., &amp; Quinn, R. E. (1995). Paradox and performance: Toward a theory of behavioral complexity in managerial leadership. ''Organization Science, 6'', 524-540.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis2000&gt;Lewis, M. W. (2000). Exploring paradox: Toward a more comprehensive guide. ''Academy of Management Review, 25'', 760-776.&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of a shared vision.&lt;ref name=bartlett1989&gt;Bartlett, C. A., &amp; Ghoshal, S. (1989). ''Managing across borders: The transnational solution''. Boston: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several characteristics of [[organizational culture]] are also emphasized on building an ambidextrous organization. Successful organizations should be able to balance the hard elements ([[discipline]] and stretch) and the soft elements ([[support group|support]] and [[trust (social sciences)|trust]]) in their organizational contexts.&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; It was also suggested that establishing shared goals, developing a [[collective identity]], creating a culture of support, and giving personal meaning to individuals’ contributions to the overall purpose of an organization all contributes to ambidexterity.&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; A decentralized structure&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt; and a culture of excellence, [[recruitment]] and [[training]]&lt;ref name=bartlett1989/&gt; are also important aspects of establishing an ambidextrous organization.

== Outcomes of organizational ambidexterity==

Ambidexterity is beneficial to organizations in many aspects. As it is the ability to keep a balance between explorative and exploitative processes, the most core outcome of ambidexterity is innovation because innovation needs both explorative and exploitative aspects. [[Innovation]] is defined as "the sequence of activities by which a new element is introduced into a [[Level of analysis|social unit]], with the intention of benefiting the unit, some part of it, or the wider society" (West &amp; Farr, 1990). The new element need not be entirely novel or unfamiliar to members of the unit, but it must involve some discernible change or challenge to the [[status quo]] (West &amp; Farr, 1990).  Most theoretical models of innovation differentiate at least two processes: idea generation and idea [[implementation]] (e.g., Amabile, 1988; West, 2002). The generation phase is closely linked to explorative activities while the implementation phase is highly linked to exploitative activities. An ambidextrous organization is able to pursue innovation (creating new products/services) while also maintaining itself through the continued use of proven techniques/products.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt;

In addition, ambidexterity can promote some other positive organizational outcomes besides innovation. It has been proved in literature that the interaction between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies (in other words, ambidexterity) is positively related to sales [[Exponential growth|growth rate]], and imbalance between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is negatively related to sales growth rate (He &amp; Wong, 2004). Various organizations have been able to overcome organizational challenges and become more innovative because of ambidexterity.  A study looking at 41 businesses found that ambidexterity was highly correlated with [[performance]].&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; Similarly, another study of 34 high-tech organizations showed that their ability to simultaneously execute exploration and exploitation was associated with higher performance (Chandrasekaran et al. 2012).

Companies such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[General Radio]], [[Nordstrom]] and [[British Airways]] have all had continued success throughout the years because of their capacity for ambidexterity. From 1981 to 1986, [[British Airways]] experienced increased profits and customer satisfaction. The top executives of [[British Airways]] credited the formation of a more ambidextrous [[culture]] and [[leadership]] with the company's improved performance.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt;

==Related moderators between organizational ambidexterity and organizational outcomes==

Moderators exist in the relationship between organizational ambidexterity and organizational outcomes. Environmental [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] and [[competitiveness]] moderate the relationship between exploitation/ [[exploration]] and [[performance]] (Levinthal &amp; March, 1993; Lewin, Long &amp; Carroll, 1999). Empirical studies also showed that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit's financial performance in more competitive environments (Jansen, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2006). Although they were not directly testing an ambidextrous orientation, results indicated a positive performance effect of simultaneously pursuing exploitative and exploratory innovation under high dynamic and competitive environments. The effects of exploitative, [[exploration|explorative]] and balanced corporate alignment activities on performance were compared under varying environmental conditions (Raisch &amp; Hotz, 2008). The construct of "environmental munificence" was developed to reflect an organization's opportunities and dynamism (Zahra, 1993). They found that, although exploration was positively related to performance under high environmental munificence, a balanced orientation failed to significantly affect performance in times of low environmental munificence (Raisch &amp; Hotz, 2008).

[[Market orientation]] was also proved to moderate the relationship between exploitation/ [[exploration]] and performance. [[Market orientation]] was defined as "the capability to generate, disseminate, and respond to intelligence pertaining to current and future customers" (Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990). A longitudinal study by Kyriakopoulos and Moorman (2004) showed that market orientation positively moderates the impact of pursuing high levels of exploitative and exploratory marketing strategies on new product performance; however, firms that pursue an ambidextrous orientation without strong market orientation display a significant reduction in new product financial performance.

Another factor that may moderate ambidexterity's effect on performance is firm [[resource]]s (Kyriakopoulos &amp; Moorman, 2004).&lt;ref name=venkatraman2007/&gt; Firms with rich resources have the ability to exploit and explore simultaneously, whereas firms with less resources may not be able to afford such a complex strategy. Similarly, Lubatkin et al.&lt;ref name=lubatkin2006/&gt; stated that small firms "lack the amount of slack resources and the kind of [[hierarchical]] administration systems that can help or impede larger firms in managing their contradictory knowledge processes and, thus, affect the attainment of ambidexterity" (p.&amp;nbsp;647). This idea was supported by empirical evidence that small firms may benefit more from a one-sided orientation than from mixed strategies (Ebben &amp; Johnson, 2005).

Boundary conditions were also addressed on choosing between [[structural]] and contextual ambidexterity. For example, spatial separation was suggested as an appropriate solution for environments characterized by long periods of stability, disrupted by rare events of discontinuous change.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt; Research also found that firms operating in dynamic competitive environments rely on contextual ambidexterity rather than developing spatially separated units (Jansen, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2005).

== Levels of ambidexterity ==

The functional definition of ambidexterity was originally used to describe organizations, but recently this concept was extended to multiple organizational levels, including individuals, teams, and leaders. On the most general level, the concept of ambidexterity implies successfully managing the [[dichotomy]] of explorative variability creation and exploitative variability reduction.

Whenever there are needs to be both explorative and exploitive, [[conflict (process)|conflict]] occurs (Bledow, Frese, Anderson, Erez, &amp; Farr, 2009). That's when ambidexterity is necessary. Actually, regulating the conflicting demands of innovation is not only a challenge for the upper echelon of an organization but also a phenomenon that spans all levels of an organization. Employees as individuals, collectives of employees such as work teams, and the organization as a whole all have to find strategies to deal with conflicting demands in order to succeed in innovation and adaption to changing markets. Some examples of strategies and tactics that could be implemented at all three levels of analysis were also listed out (Bledow et al., 2009). These examples are presented in Table 1, including a separation strategy (in the Separation column) or an integration strategy (in the last two columns).

== Ambidextrous leadership ==

Recently the focus on organizational ambidexterity has become more concentrated on how leaders act ambidextrously to achieve organizational ambidexterity. Senior managers may be the key for facilitating the context and social base for ambidexterity. Noting that ambidextrous organizations require significant amounts of mobilization, coordination, and integration activities to maintain both exploitation and exploration, informal and social integration of the senior team as well as the cross-functional interfaces of the formal organization contribute to the success of organizational ambidexterity significantly (Jansen, Tempelaar, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2009). A recent model of ambidexterity and leadership suggests that [[CEO]]s and top management teams (TMT) play an integral role in establishing ambidexterity in small-to-medium-sized organizations (Cao, Simsek, &amp; Zhang, 2010). The model suggests TMTs are where processes such as information sharing and knowledge processing, which influence ambidexterity, are likely to occur. Furthermore, it is the CEO who has the ability to access the most valuable and diverse information needed to avoid separation of explorative and exploitative behaviors. The greater the interface between TMTs and CEOs in small-to-medium-sized organizations, the greater the amount of ambidexterity.

The concept of ambidexterity was first formally introduced into the leadership area by the Rosing, Frese and Bausch (2011) paper, holding the idea that leaders should be able to lead their team to match the complexity and the pace of innovation (Ancona, Goodman, Lawrence, &amp; Tushman, 2001). Ambidextrous leadership was defined as the leaders’ ability to foster both explorative and exploitative behaviors in followers by increasing or reducing variance in their behavior and flexibly switching between those behaviors (Rosing et al., 2011).

The construct of ambidextrous leadership has also been linked to the combination of [[leadership styles]] (Jansen et al., 2009). Leaders who are transformational encourage "out of the box thinking", information sharing and question assumptions.[[Transformational leadership|Transformational leaders]] promote exploration and innovative thinking. [[Transactional leadership|Transactional leaders]] focus on making incremental improvements and making the best use of existing process. The transactional leadership style promotes exploitative behaviors. An ambidextrous leader is able to switch back and forth between transformation/exploration and transaction/exploitation as needed, in other words, being able to switch between different leadership styles at the appropriate time, in order to foster innovation and then implement plans. Ambidextrous leadership consists of three elements (1) opening leader behaviors to foster exploration, (2) closing leader behaviors to foster exploitation, (3) and the temporal flexibility to switch between both as the situation requires (Rosing et al., 2011). Opening leadership behaviors include: allowing for multiple ways to accomplish a task, experimentation and errors, whereas closing behaviors include; monitoring routines, sticking to plans and minimizing errors. The Rosing et al. (2011)'s model of leadership and innovation was shown in Figure 1.

==Controversy and future directions==

Some scholars as well as practitioners have argued that established companies simply lack the flexibility to explore new territories.&lt;ref name=lewis2000/&gt; One contributing reason could be the so-called [[success trap]] (i.e. the focus on their, historically successful, current business activities) (Walrave, Van Oorschot, &amp; Romme, 2011). A possible solution for big companies is to adopt a venture capital model – funding exploratory expeditions but otherwise not interfering too much with their operations. Another suggestion is for the use of [[cross-functional team]]s to achieve breakthrough innovations. Still others have suggested that a company may be able to alternate between different organizational models, focusing on exploitation and [[exploration]] at different time periods. For example, in a study of biotechnology firms it is shown how an organization's [[management control system]] can be adjusted periodically to achieve this changing focus on exploitation and exploration.&lt;ref name="mccarthy2011"/&gt; Researchers also debate if [[ambidexterity]] can be attained because [[exploration]] and exploitation tend to emerge from contradictory information and knowledge inputs and because success due to [[exploration]]/exploitation tends to be self-reinforcing leading to the use of the same methods in the future.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=floyd2000&gt;Floyd, S. W. &amp; Lane, P. J. (2000). "Strategizing throughout the Organization: Managing Role Conflict in Strategic Renewal". ''The Academy of Management Review, 25'', 154-177.&lt;/ref&gt; An empirical study of [[ambidexterity]] in organizations (He &amp; Wong, 2004) further cautions that very low levels of both [[exploration]] and exploitation are not sufficient to contribute to superior firm performance. High firm performance may however need to be sustained through continuous exploitation both on the market side, through [[business model]] innovation and technology innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaulio|first=Matti|last2=Thorén|first2=Kent|last3=Rohrbeck|first3=René|date=2017-12-01|title=Double ambidexterity: How a Telco incumbent used business-model and technology innovations to successfully respond to three major disruptions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/caim.12246/abstract|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=339–352|doi=10.1111/caim.12246|issn=1467-8691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambidexterity can also be hampered by employee desire to receive [[work motivation|organizational rewards]]. If organizations base their evaluation and [[reward system]]s on the completion of routine tasks, employees will be more likely to conform to standardized procedures.&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; To avoid hindering ambidexterity, organizations should be sure to reward innovative thinking as well as completion of routine tasks.

Despite the controversy surrounding the possibility of organizational ambidexterity, it is likely to continue to be a highly researched concept in the future. Future research is likely to focus on the role of ambidextrous leaders, ambidextrous teams and the [[Social environment|social context]] of organizational ambidexterity. (Rosing et al., 2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55292">''' American business history''' is a history of business, entrepreneurship, and corporations, together with responses by consumers, critics, and government, in the United States from colonial times  to the present. In broader context, it is a major part of the [[Economic history of the United States]], but focuses on specific business enterprises.

==Colonial era==

===New England===

The [[History of New England|New England]] region's economy grew steadily over the entire colonial era, despite the lack of a staple crop that could be exported. All the provinces and many towns as well, tried to foster economic growth by subsidizing projects that improved the infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, inns and ferries. They gave bounties and subsidies or monopolies to [[sawmill]]s, [[grist mill]]s, [[iron mill]]s, [[pulling mill]]s (which treated cloth), [[salt works]] and [[Glassblowing|glassworks]]. Most important, colonial legislatures set up a legal system that was conducive to business enterprise by resolving disputes, enforcing contracts, and protecting property rights. Hard work and entrepreneurship characterized the region, as the [[Puritans]] and [[Yankee]]s endorsed the "[[Protestant Work Ethic|Protestant Ethic]]", which enjoined men to work hard as part of their divine calling.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Alan Newell, "The Birth of New England in the Atlantic Economy: From its Beginning to 1770," in Peter Temin, ed., ''Engines of Enterprise: An Economic History of New England'' (Harvard UP, 2000), pp. 11–68, esp. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early national==

=== Government policy===
The federal government under President George Washington and Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]] strongly promoted business enterprise in the 1790s.  He had a vision of an industrial nation, based on the strength of urban America.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Nelson, "Alexander Hamilton and American Manufacturing: A Reexamination." ''Journal of American History'' 65.4 (1979): 971-995. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1894556 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Shankman, "'A New Thing on Earth': Alexander Hamilton, Pro-Manufacturing Republicans, and the Democratization of American Political Economy." ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 23.3 (2003): 323-352. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3595043 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington himself was business-oriented, and was involved in numerous projects to develop transportation and access to Western lands.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Lengel, ''First Entrepreneur: How George Washington Built His—and the Nation's—Prosperity'' (Da Capo, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banking===
[[File:ASTOR, John Jacob (signed check).jpg|thumb|238px|Bank of the United States check signed by [[John Jacob Astor]] in 1792]]
{{main|History of banking in the United States}}
Organized banking began on a small scale after the American Revolution, with a few private banks in Boston and New York, such as the [[Bank of North America]].

At Hamilton's initiative, and over the opposition of Thomas Jefferson, Congress set up the privately owned [[First Bank of the United States]] (BUS) to provide a uniform financial system for the 13 states.&lt;ref&gt;Sylla, Richard. "US securities markets and the banking system, 1790-1840." ''Review-Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis'' 80 (1998): 83-98. [https://m.research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/98/05/9805rs.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BUS handled national finances, tax receipts and government expenditures, and funded the national debt. Increasingly became involved in lending to business, and especially assisting new local banks in unifying the national monetary and financial system.&lt;ref&gt;David Cowen, 'The origins and economic impact of the First Bank of the United States, 1791-1797'' (Garland Pub., 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  Jefferson supporters never stop complaining of the dangers provided by the special interests behind a private national Bank,  and block the renewal of its charter in 1811. The bank closed, and the government had enormous difficulty in financing the War of 1812. President James Madison, despite his Jeffersonian heritage of anti-banking rhetoric, realized the need for a replacement, and the [[Second Bank of the United States]] was opened in 1816. It flourished, promoting a strong financial system across the country, until it was challenged and destroyed by President Andrew Jackson, Jefferson's successor, in the [[Bank War]] of 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Bray Hammond, ''Bank and Politics in America: From the Revolution to the Civil War'' (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert V. Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and the bank war'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Civil War, the Lincoln administration strongly supported banking, making it attractive for local banks to invest in federal bonds, which could then be used to set up a local national bank.&lt;ref&gt;Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and an Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  The nation operated without any supervising national bank until 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was created.&lt;ref&gt;James Livingston, ''Origins of the Federal Reserve System: Money, class, and corporate capitalism, 1890-1913'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business centers===
====Boston====
[[Boston]] remained the dominant business center in New England, and its entrepreneurs pushed west to [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Edick Wright and Katheryn P. Viens, eds.,  ''Entrepreneurs: The Boston Business Community, 1700-1850'' (Massachusetts Historical Society, 2005) With 14 essays by scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Boston Associates]] were merchants who took their fortunes made in world trade, and concentrated on building factory towns near Boston, most famously Lowell.   By 1845, there were 31 textile companies—located in [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], and southern [[Maine]]—produced one-fifth of all cotton and wool textiles in the United States. With the capital earned through these mills, they invested in railroads, especially the [[Boston and Lowell]]. These railroads helped transport the cotton from warehouses to factories. These Boston-based investors established banks—such as the [[Suffolk Bank]]—and invested in others. In time, they controlled 40% of banking capital in Boston, 40% of all insurance capital in Massachusetts, and 30% of Massachusetts' railroads. Tens of thousands of New Englanders received employment from these investors, working in any one of the hundreds of their mills.&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Dalzell, ''Enterprising elite: The Boston Associates and the world they made'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francois Weil,  "Capitalism and industrialization in New England, 1815-1845." ''Journal of American History'' 84#4 (1998): 1334-1354. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2568084 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baltimore====
In the South, by far the major business center was [[History of Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]].  It had a large port to handle imports and exports, and a large hinterland that included the tobacco regions of Maryland and Virginia. It dominated the flour trade.  Alexander Brown (1764–1834) arrived in 1800 and set up a linen business and his firm [[Alex. Brown &amp; Sons]] expanded into cotton and shipping, with branches in [[Liverpool|Liverpool, England]], Philadelphia, and New York. The firm Helped finance the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] to tap its own hinterland as far as Pennsylvania and Ohio. Brown was a business innovator after 1819 when cash and short credits became the norms of business relations. By concentrating his capital in small-risk ventures and acquiring ships and stock in the [[Second Bank of the United States]] he came to monopolize Baltimore's shipping trade with Liverpool by 1822. Brown next expanded into packet ships, extended his lines to Philadelphia, and began financing Baltimore importers, specializing in merchant banking from the late 1820s to his death in 1834. The emergence of a money economy and the growth of the Anglo-American cotton trade allowed him to escape Baltimore's declining position in trans-Atlantic trade. His most important innovation was the drawing up of his own bills of exchange. By 1830 his company rivaled the Bank of the United States in the American foreign exchange markets, and the transition from the "traditional" to the "modern" merchant was nearly complete.  It became the nation's first investment banking.&lt;ref&gt;Gary L. Browne,  "Business Innovation and Social Change: the Career of Alexander Brown after the War of 1812," ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' (1974) 69#3 pp: 243-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Bruchey, ''Robert Oliver, Merchant of Baltimore, 1783-1819'' (1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Baltimore and Ohio Railroad=====
Baltimore faced economic stagnation unless it opened routes to the western states, as [[New York (state)|New York]] had done with the [[Erie Canal]] in 1820. In 1827, twenty-five merchants and bankers studied the best means of restoring "that portion of the Western trade which has recently been diverted from it by the introduction of steam navigation."  Their answer was to build a railroad—one of the first commercial lines in the world. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O) became the first important American railroad. Some 20,000 investors purchased $5 million in stock to import the rolling stock and build the line.  It was a commercial and financial success, and invented many new managerial methods that became standard practice in railroading and modern business. The B&amp;O became the first company to operate a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]] built in America, with the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]]'' in 1829. It built the first [[train station|passenger and freight station]] (Mount Clare in 1829) and was the first railroad that earned passenger revenues (December 1829), and published a timetable (May 23, 1830). On December 24, 1852, it became the first rail line to reach the [[Ohio River]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Road: The Building of the Baltimore and Ohio, the Nation's First Railroad, 1828–1853 |last=Dilts |first=James D. |year=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JjrCWPwvHzIC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The B&amp;O railroad was merged into [[CSX]] in 1987.

==Big business: the impact of the railroads==
Railroads had a dramatic large-scale impact on American business in five dimensions.

===Shipping freight and passengers===
First they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. The late 19th century pipelines were added, and in the 20th century trucking and aviation.&lt;ref&gt;Leland H. Jenks, "Railroads as an economic force in American development." ''Journal of Economic History'' 4#1 (1944): 1-20. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2113700 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basis of the private financial system===
Railroads financing provided the basis of the private (non-governmental) financial system. Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories or canals.  The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts.   A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers  cost about the same as one mile of track.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).&lt;ref&gt;Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age: Business, labor, and public policy, 1860-1897'' (1961) p 52, 68-74.&lt;/ref&gt;
Funding came from financiers throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., "Patterns of American Railroad Finance, 1830-50," ''Business History Review'' 28#3 (1954), pp. 248-263 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111573 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government provided no cash to any other railroads. However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route.  Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. Larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age''  (1961) pp 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Leland H. Jenks, "Britain and American railway development." ''Journal of Economic History'' 11#4 (1951): 375-388. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2113694 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914-1917, they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Mira Wilkins,  "Foreign Investment in the US Economy before 1914." ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' (1991): 9-21. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1047318 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E. Hidy, ed., ''British investment in American railways, 1834-1898'' (Eleutherian Mills-Hagley Foundation, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saul Engelbourg, ''The man who found the money: John Stewart Kennedy and the financing of the western railroads'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Sexton, "Transatlantic financiers and the Civil War." ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 2#3 (2001): 29-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventing modern management===
The third dimension was in designing complex managerial systems that could handle far more complicated simultaneous relationships than could be dreamed of by the local factory owner who could patrol every part of his own factory in a matter of hours. Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred D. Chandler and Stephen Salsbury. "The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration." in Bruce Mazlish, ed., ''The Railroad and the Space Program'' (MIT Press, 1965)  pp 127-62&lt;/ref&gt;

After a serious accident, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers keep track of all train movement. Discipline was essential—everyone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler and Salsbury, "The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration."  pp 130-34&lt;/ref&gt; As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations.  The [[Erie Railroad]], faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]—the largest in the world—was making further advances in using bureaucracy under [[John Edgar Thomson]], president 1852-1874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler and Salsbury, "The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration,"  pp 134-63&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career paths===
The fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakemen at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57.  Women were not hired.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Licht, ''working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983) p 289&lt;/ref&gt;

White-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care.  Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.&lt;ref&gt;Licht, ''Working for the Railroad'' pp 262-63. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;  Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.&lt;ref&gt;Dora L. Costa, "The evolution of retirement." in  Costa, ''The Evolution of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880-1990'' (U of Chicago Press, 1998), pp 6-31 [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6108.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love-hate relationship with the railroads===
America developed a love-hate relationship with railroads. Boosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people who dressed in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:
:The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignified, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism.]] The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology....[Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Nye|title=American Technological Sublime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrdbOJFxWIoC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel became much easier, cheaper and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores.  Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering.  Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:
: with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine a United States of continental proportions without the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;Gary S. Cross and Rick Szostak, ''Technology and American society: A history'' (2005) p 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zussman, ''Mechanics of the middle class: work and politics among American engineers'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station in New York City]], and the [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington DC]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl W. Condit, "Cincinnati Passenger Stations Before 1930," ''Railroad History'' No. 132 (1975) pp. 5-36 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43520516 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

But there was also a dark side. As early as the 1830s, novelists and poets began fretting that the railroads would destroy the rustic attractions of the American landscape. By the 1840s concerns were rising about terrible accidents when speeding trains crashed into helpless wooden carriages.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Douglas, ''All Aboard! The Railroad in American Life'' (1992), chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western  farmers who absorbed the [[Granger movement]] theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices. Local merchants and shippers supported the demand and got some "[[Granger Laws]]" passed.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Miller, "Origins of the Iowa Granger Law," ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 40#4 (1954), pp. 657-680 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1895862 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated in late 19th century political rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, ''All Aboard!'' (1992), chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of establishing a strong rate fixing federal body was achieved during the [[Progressive Era]], primarily by a coalition of shipping interests.&lt;ref&gt;Harold U. Faulkner, ''The Decline of Laissez Faire, 1897-1917'' (1951),  pp 187-219.&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad historians mark the [[Hepburn Act]] of 1906 that gave the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) the power to set maximum railroad rates as a damaging blow to the long-term profitability and growth of railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexandra Kindell and Elizabeth S. Demers, eds.|title=Encyclopedia of Populism in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g46dAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA591|year=2014|pages=590–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1910 the lines faced an emerging trucking industry to compete with for freight, and automobiles and buses to compete for passenger service.&lt;ref&gt;Albro Martin, ''Railroads Triumphant: The Growth, Rejection, and Rebirth of a Vital American Force'' (Oxford UP, 1991), pp 348-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==

=== The general store===
[[Image:General store, Deaf Smith County Museum, Hereford, TX IMG 4858.JPG|thumb|right|200px|General store exhibit at the [[Deaf Smith County Historical Museum]] in [[Hereford, Texas|Hereford]], Texas]]

General stores, and itinerant peddlers, dominated in rural America until the coming of the automobile after 1910.  Farmers and ranchers depended on general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices.  Often farmers would barter butter, cheese, eggs, vegetables or other foods which the merchant would resell. Prices were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criterion was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying off the bill when crops, hogs or cattle were later sold; the owner's ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success.  The store was typically a gathering point for local men to chat, pass around the weekly newspaper, and talk politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis E. Atherton, ''The Frontier Merchant in Mid-America'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D. Clark, ''Pills, Petticoats, and Plows: The Southern Country Store'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South the general store was especially important after the Civil War, as the merchant was one of the few sources of seasonal credit available until the cash crops (usually cotton or tobacco) were harvested in the fall. There were very few nearby towns, so rural general stores and itinerant peddlers were the main sources of supply.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline P. Bull, "The General Merchant in the Economic History of the New South." ''Journal of Southern History'' 18.1 (1952): 37-59. in JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn N. Sisk, "Rural Merchandising in the Alabama Black Belt, 1875–1917." ''Journal of Farm Economics'' 37.4 (1955): 705-715.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ransom, and Richard Sutch. "Credit merchandising in the post-emancipation south: Structure, conduct, and performance." ''Explorations in Economic History'' 16.1 (1979): 64-89; heavily statistical [http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/EB/alston/econ8534/SectionV/Ransom_and_Sutch,_Credit_Merchandising_in_the_Post-Emancipation_South.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail in towns and small cities===
In the small cities consumers had more choices, usually purchasing dry goods and supplies at locally owned department store. Sometimes entrepreneurs opened stores in nearby cities, as [[Goldwater's|did the Goldwater]] family in Arizona.  They had a much wider selection of goods than in the country general stores and price tags that gave the actual selling price. Department stores provided limited credit, and set up attractive displays and, after 1900, window displays as well. Their clerks—usually men before the 1940s—were experienced salesmen whose knowledge of the products appealed to the better educated middle-class women who did most of the shopping. The keys to success were a large variety of high-quality brand-name merchandise, high turnover, reasonable prices, and frequent special sales. The larger stores sent their buyers to Chicago or other big wholesale centers once or twice a year to evaluate the newest trends in merchandising and stock up on the latest fashions. By the 1920s and 1930s, large mail-order houses such as [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.]] and [[Montgomery Ward]] provided serious competition.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Emmet, and John E Jeuck, ''Catalogs and Counters: A History of Sears, Roebuck and Company'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Boorstin, "A. Montgomery Ward's Mail-Order Business," ''Chicago History'' (1973) 2#3 pp 142–152.&lt;/ref&gt;   In response the local department stores came to rely even more on salesmanship as well as close integration with the community.&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. Klassen, "T.C. Power &amp; Bro.: The Rise of a Small Western Department Store, 1870-1902," ''Business History Review,'' (1992) 66#4 pp 671+ [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3116844 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William R. Leach, "Transformations in a Culture of Consumption: Women and Department Stores, 1890-1925," ''Journal of American History'' 71 (Sept. 1984): 319-42 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1901758 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[List of defunct department stores of the United States]].

=== The big city department store ===
{{Main|Department store}}
In every large city department stores appeared in the mid-19th century aimed at affluent women customers. They followed a model that originated in London and Paris, but all the major department stores quickly copied new features from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Jan  Whitaker, ''Service and Style: How the American Department Store Fashioned the Middle Class'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   In New York City in 1862, [[Alexander Turney Stewart]] built a store on a full city block with eight floors and nineteen departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, [[departmentalization]], vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases. Beauty and elegance were central themes, the department stores hired attractive upscale young women to deal with the customers, while the back rooms the men made practically all the decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Harry E. Resseguie, "Alexander Turney Stewart and the Development of the Department Store, 1823-1876," ''Business History Review'' (1965) 39#3 pp. 301-322 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3112143 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William R. Leach, "Transformations in a culture of consumption: women and department stores, 1890-1925." ''Journal of American History'' (1984): 319-342. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1901758 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Benson, ''Counter Cultures: Saleswomen, Managers, and Customers in American Department Stores, 1890-1940'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-service===
Until now retail stores involved customers giving orders to clerks who assembled merchandise. Self-service, whereby the customer roamed the aisles and picked out what she wanted, was innovation in the early 20th century that made possible supermarket grocery chains and other forms of [[chain store]]s. [[Clarence Saunders (grocer)|Clarence Saunders]]  (1881-1953) launched the self-service revolution with his [[Piggly Wiggly]] store in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Freeman, ''Clarence Saunders and the Founding of Piggly Wiggly:  The Rise &amp; Fall of a Memphis Maverick'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Clarence-Saunders-Founding-Piggly-Wiggly/dp/1609492854/ excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The store depended on personal shopping baskets, branded products, and checkouts at the front. A critical ingredient was the educated consumer who had familiarized herself with brand-name products and prices. By 1922, Piggly Wiggly had opened 1,200 stores in 29 states.  Saunders, however, went bankrupt through speculation on Wall Street in 1923.   By 1932, the chain had grown to 2,660 stores doing over $180 million annually. The stores were either owned by the firm and franchised. The success encouraged imitators, including Handy Andy stores, Helpy Selfy stores, Mick-or-Mack stores and [[Jitney Jungle]], all of which operated under patented systems.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henry Nystrom, ''Economics of Retailing'' (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; During Great Depression, chain stores became the targets of angry local merchants, who secured the [[Robinson–Patman Act]] of 1936; it was a federal law that required all retailers to charge the same price for certain items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles R. Geisst|title=Encyclopedia of American Business History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dGig0fYlj8C&amp;pg=PA364|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising===
{{main|History of advertising}}
[[File:J. Walter Thompson Advertisement 1903.JPG|thumb|left|275px|J. Walter Thompson Co. promotes high-powered advertisement, 1903]]

By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.  At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.  [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was located in Philadelphia. In 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising. Most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: Quaker Oats, Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and Procter &amp; Gamble soap.  By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires,  nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pope, ''The making of modern advertising'' (1983) pp 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt;  Agencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of copywriters.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency: N. W. Ayer &amp; Son 1869-1949'' (1949) pp 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1900 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 33. "As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods."&lt;/ref&gt; Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Pope|title=The making of modern advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bElPAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The golden age of black entrepreneurship==
{{main| African-American business history}}
The nadir of race relations was reached in the early 20th century, in terms of political and legal rights. Blacks were increasingly segregated. However the more they were cut off from the larger white community, the more black entrepreneurs succeeded in establishing flourishing businesses that catered to a black clientele. In urban areas, North and South, the size and income of the black population was growing, providing openings for a wide range of businesses, from barbershops &lt;ref&gt;Quincy T. Mills, ''Cutting along the Color Line: Black Barbers and Barber Shops in America'' (2013) [https://www.questia.com/library/120086708/cutting-along-the-color-line-black-barbers-and-barber online]&lt;/ref&gt;  to insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;Walter B. Weare, ''Black Business in the New South: A Social History of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Weems, Jr., ''Black Business in the Black Metropolis: The Chicago Metropolitan Assurance Company, 1925-1985'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Undertakers had a special niche, and often played a political role.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Boyd, "Black undertakers in northern cities during the great migration: The rise of an entrepreneurial occupation." ''Sociological Focus'' 31.3 (1998): 249-263.

Historian Juliet Walker calls 1900-1930 the "Golden age of black business." &lt;ref&gt;Juliet E.K. Walker, ''The history of black business in America: Capitalism, race, entrepreneurship'' (2009) p 183.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Negro Business League, the number black-owned businesses doubled from 20,000 1900 and 40,000 in 1914. There were 450 undertakers in 1900 and, rising to 1000. Drugstores rose from 250 to 695. Local retail merchants – most of them quite small – jumped from 10,000 to 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;August Meier,  "Negro Class Structure and Ideology in the Age of Booker T. Washington."

Du Bois, ''The Negro in business: report of a social study made under the direction of Atlanta University'' (1899) [http://scua.library.umass.edu/digital/dubois/dubois4.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous entrepreneurs was [[Madame C.J. Walker]] (1867-1919); she built a national franchise  business called [[Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company]] based on her invention of the first successful hair straightening process.&lt;ref&gt;A'Lelia Bundles, ''On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker'' (2002) [https://www.amazon.com/On-Her-Own-Ground-Paperback/dp/0743431723  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

College president [[Booker T. Washington]] (1856-1915), who ran the [[National Negro Business League]] was the most prominent promoter of black business. He moved from city to city to sign up local entrepreneurs into his national network the National Negro Business League.&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Boston, ''The Business Strategy of Booker T. Washington: Its Development and Implementation'' (2010) [https://www.questia.com/library/120088955/the-business-strategy-of-booker-t-washington-its online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis R.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tvj64 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although black business flourished in urban areas, it was severely handicapped in the rural South where the great majority of blacks lived. Blacks were farmers who depended on  one cash crop, typically cotton or tobacco. They chiefly traded with local white merchants. The primary reason was that the local country stores provided credit, that is the provided supplies the farm and family needed, including tools, seeds, food and clothing, on a credit basis until the bill was paid off at harvest time. Black businessmen had too little access to credit to enter this business.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline P. Bull, "The General Merchant in the Economic History of the New South." ''Journal of Southern History'' 18.1 (1952): 37-59. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2954791 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn N. Sisk, "Rural Merchandising in the Alabama Black Belt, 1875–1917." ''Journal of Farm Economics'' 37.4 (1955): 705-715. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1234631 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, there were only a small number of wealthy blacks ; overwhelmingly they were real estate speculators in the fast-growing cities, such as [[Robert Reed Church]] in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Meier, ''Negro thought in America, 1880-1915'' p 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy industry==

===Steel===
{{main|Carnegie Steel Company|History of the steel industry (1850–1970)}}
Numerous smaller companies when operation before the Civil War the British innovation of making inexpensive steel, which is much stronger than traditional ironwork, cause the radical transformation. Young [[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835–1919)  was a key leader.  He was not an engineer, but he gave experts in the mills in Pitsburgh their lead, and he moved to New York City to sell large quantities of steel for the new bridges, railways and skyscrapers. [[File:Eads Bridge from Laclede's Landing, Sep 2012.jpg|thumb|Eads Bridge across the Mississippi River at ST Louis, opened in 1874 using Carnegie steel]]  By 1890 Carnegie Steel was the world's largest manufacturer of [[pig iron]], steel rails, and [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. In 1888, Carnegie bought the rival [[Homestead Steel Works]], which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a 425-mile (685&amp;nbsp;km) long railway, and a line of [[Lake freighter|lake steamships]]. Consolidation came in 1892 through the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].  By 1889, American output of steel exceeded that of Britain, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. By 1900, the profits of Carnegie Bros. &amp; Company alone stood at $40,000,000 with $25,000,000 being Carnegie's share.  Carnegie's empire grew to include the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works|J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works]], Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker &amp; County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the Mississippi River in St. Louis, Missouri (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology which marked the opening of a new steel market.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Hughes, ''The Vital View: American Economic Progress and its ''protagonists'' (1966) pp 220-73 covers Carnegie's industrial career.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Steel]] was the iconic billion-dollar industrial corporation. It was formed by banker [[J. P. Morgan]] (1837-1913) and lawyer [[Elbert H. Gary]] (1846-1927) in 1901 by combining the Carnegie Steel Company with Gary's Federal Steel Company, and several smaller concerns. Carnegie permanently left industry to become a philanthropist on a global basis, and judge Gary ran the operation. In 1907, it received federal permission to buy out its largest competitor, the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, To end a panic on Wall Street. It escaped prosecution for monopoly by arguing it had never engaged in any illegal monopolistic practices. But it was classes, and year-by-year watched its share of the market decline has been competitors entered the steel industry to provide warships, building materials and supply railroad same consumer products.   By 1902 U.S. Steel made 67 percent of all the steel produced in the United States. One hundred years later, it accounted for only 8 percent of domestic consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Warren, ''Big Steel: The First Century of the United States Steel Corporation 1901-2001'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bestshoring''', also known as rightshoring, is the process of identifying the best location to move [[manufacturing]], [[Information technology|IT]] or [[business]] processes for a company. The decision is to be based on quantifiable criteria which are intended to take subjective and [[political]] input out of the [[decision cycle]]. Many companies use external [[consulting firm]]s to make these decisions.

On August 1, 2004, [[Hillary Clinton]] wrote an article explaining why bestshoring beats [[outsourcing]]. Her argument is that "[[Foreign labor]] isn't as cheap as it seems."

[[File:Jam-before-Bottleneck.png|thumb|400x400px|Example illustration of a bottleneck in a manufacturing material flow]]

In [[production (economics)|production]] and [[project management]], a '''bottleneck''' is one process in a chain of processes, such that its limited capacity reduces the capacity of the whole chain. The result of having a bottleneck are stalls in production, supply overstock, pressure from customers and low employee morale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Effects of a Bottleneck in Warehousing|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/effects-bottleneck-warehousing-32369.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are both short and long-term bottlenecks. Short-term bottlenecks are temporary and are not normally a significant problem. An example of a short-term bottleneck would be a skilled employee taking a few days off. Long-term bottlenecks occur all the time and can cumulatively significantly slow down production. An example of a long-term bottleneck is when a machine is not efficient enough and as a result has a long queue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unblocking Bottlenecks: Fixing Unbalanced Processes|url = https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_76.htm|website = www.mindtools.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = bottleneck - Demand Solutions|url = http://www.demandsolutions.co.uk/resource-center/supply-chain-glossary/supply-chain-glossary-b/bottleneck.html|website = www.demandsolutions.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the lack of [[smelter]] and [[Refining (metallurgy)|refinery]] supply which cause bottlenecks upstream.

Another example is in a [[surface-mount technology]] board assembly line with several pieces of equipment aligned. Usually the common sense is driven to set up and shift the bottleneck element towards the end of the process, inducing the better and faster machines to always keep the [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) supply flowing up, never allowing the slower ones to fully stop, a fact that would be heeded as a deleterious and significant overall drawback on the process.

== Identifying bottlenecks ==
[[File:Screen Shot 2015-11-03 at 1.46.58 pm.png|thumb|253x253px|Cycle of identifying, managing and preventing bottlenecks in production]]
Almost every system has a bottleneck, even if it is a minor one, if every system was running at full capacity, at least one machine would be accumulating processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = There is always a bottleneck.  Sometimes it is you. {{!}} BERKONOMICS|url = http://berkonomics.com/?p=843|website = BERKONOMICS|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying bottlenecks is critical for improving efficiency in the production line because it allows you to determine the area where accumulation occurs. The machine or process that accumulates the longest queue is usually a bottleneck, however this isn't always the case. Bottlenecks can be found through: identifying the areas where accumulation occurs, evaluating the throughput, assessing whether each machine is being used at full capacity and finding the machine with the high wait time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Identify Bottlenecks in Manufacturing|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/identify-bottlenecks-manufacturing-72465.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Eliminate Bottlenecks for Process Improvements|url = http://www.executiveblueprints.com/tips/090511bottlenecks.htm|website = www.executiveblueprints.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accumulation ===
When input comes in faster than the speed of the process, accumulation starts to occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that the machine either does not have enough capacity, is not being fully utilized (inefficient in use) or has an under-qualified operator. This method is not effective at identifying bottlenecks where the queues are at several process steps, as there are multiple processes with accumulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Throughput ===
Since the production line is directly linked to the output of the machines, it allows for the identifying of the main bottleneck in the manufacturing process. In changing each machines throughput, it will be possible to assess which machine affects the overall output the most, and hence determine the bottleneck in the chain of processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bottleneck (Constraint) {{!}} Lean Manufacturing|url = http://www.lean-manufacturing-japan.com/scm-terminology/bottleneck-constraint.html|website = www.lean-manufacturing-japan.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Full capacity ===
By using the utilization percentage of each production unit, it is possible to determine the machine which uses the highest percentage of its capacity. This machine is bottlenecking the other machines by 'forcing' them to operate at a lower capacity. However, if all machines in the chain of processes are running at a similar capacity level, increasing the capacity of the lowest machine will not create a significant improvement to the total output.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Wait times ===
In the case where several production units are already running at full capacity, tracking the down time of machines will allow you to identify which machine is being bottlenecked. Usually the machine prior the machine with the highest wait or down time in the chain of processes is a bottleneck. The result of this is a machine being under utilized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram.svg|thumb|310x310px|Fishbone Diagram - for finding bottlenecks]]

=== Fishbone diagram ===
A fishbone diagram is a graphical means for finding possible problems in a chain of processes. By collecting the different data related to the problem, and inputting them into the diagram, it becomes easier to analyze the data in the order it used and hence determine the root of the problem. This is commonly used to find the bottleneck in a chain of processes due to being able to pinpoint the machine precisely responsible for the delay in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/44630/Timilsina_Binod.pdf?sequence=1|title = REMOVING BOTTLENECK FROM A MANUFACTURING|date = March 2012|accessdate = November 3, 2015|website = theseus.fl|publisher = Binod Timilsina|last = Timilsina|first = Binod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences of bottlenecks in production ==
The consequences of having bottlenecks in production are possible stalls in production, supply overstock, fall in employee morale and loss of customers. Bottlenecks can result in the overloading of a machine. Overloading a machine can lead to the machinery getting damaged or worn out and result of this would be potential stretches of downtime in the long term.

=== Stall in production ===
A stall in production would be the result of one machine slowing down the entire chain of processes and consistently leaving the other machines unable to continue while it accumulates a large queue. This inefficiency significantly slows down production as many resources such as time, people and machines are being paid to wait.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Supply overstock ===
In the event of accumulation in the long-term, the capacity at which the bottlenecked machine is running could be so slow that the accumulated resources that are in the queue need to be stored. The cost of storing resources is significant as it takes resources to transport the materials back and forth as well as requiring space, another potential cost.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Fall in employee morale ===
The result of bottlenecks could require more work from employees as well as longer hours. In addition, there's the factor of stress and frustration with the bottlenecked machine and its operator. This could result in loss of efficiency as employees may not be very motivated to work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Managing bottlenecks ==
Once the bottleneck has been identified, assessing the degree of the bottleneck is crucial for determining how to manage the bottleneck. The bottleneck could be either minor or severe. Minor bottlenecks may not need to be immediately addressed, whereas severe bottlenecks should be dealt with immediately. There are several ways to eliminate bottlenecks. Some means of doing so are: Adding resources to the bottleneck operation (more people),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Identifying and Managing Bottlenecks|url = http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/accounting-for-managers/s11-08-identifying-and-managing-bottl.html|website = 2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; minimising downtime,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Managing Bottlenecks|url = http://toolkit.smallbiz.nsw.gov.au/part/13/68/289|website = toolkit.smallbiz.nsw.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; eliminate non-value activities, investing in more machinery which completes the same action and optimising the bottlenecks operation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Manage Bottlenecks in Operations Management - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-manage-bottlenecks-in-operations-management.html|website = www.dummies.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Techniques to Manage Bottlenecks|url = http://www.tom-gray.com/2014/05/21/techniques-to-manage-bottlenecks/|website = Thomas H. Gray, Profit Spotter|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources similarly suggest that once the bottleneck has been identified it is best to ensure it is well maintained,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tips on Managing Bottlenecks|url = http://www.pcs-info.com/article_tips_on_managing_bottlenecks.htm|website = www.pcs-info.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a constant buffer stock upstream of the bottleneck, to reduce time wasted in set ups and changeovers and to train more operators for the bottlenecked machines.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What manufacturing supply chain risks lurk inside your operation – and how can you help manage them?|url = https://www.travelers.com/prepare-prevent/protect-your-business/supply-chain-management/bottleneck-management.aspx|website = www.travelers.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Managing Manufacturing Bottlenecks|url = http://plantrun.co.uk/managing-manufacturing-bottlenecks.html|website = PlantRun|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are further explained below. Having production scheduling to optimise efficiency is another means of effectively utilising the bottlenecked machine. This minimises the possibility for the situation where the production quota is not met. Scheduling also reduces the number of situations where production is halted due to a lack of personnel, due to increased organisation and greater planned out production. It also allows for the full advantage of the time available to be taken as pockets of time can be found to keep the machine running for as many hours as possible in a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Relieving Bottlenecks|url = http://shift-work.com/shift-schedule-issues/relieving-bottlenecks/|website = Shiftwork Solutions LLC - Shift Schedule Change Management|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increasing number of operators or employees ===
Increasing the number of operators or increasing the number of staff can be beneficial for multiple reasons. Increasing the number of operators can increase efficiency&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as they can all work different timed shifts and hence the bottlenecked machine can run for longer hours.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, if one worker is sick, unable to work or quits, there will always be someone available to replace him. Increasing the number of employees can be beneficial to increasing efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Fix Bottlenecks That Increase Production Costs - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-fix-bottlenecks-that-increase-production-co.html|website = www.dummies.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because they can be reassigned to work on parts of the bottlenecked machines operations which can be broken down into smaller activities and reassigned to reduce the work load of the machine hence reducing the accumulation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By reassigning other work to different machines, the less accumulation or delay the bottlenecked machine has and hence significantly speeds up production as it also reduces the wait time of the machines farther along the chain of processes to increase productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Solutions To Bottlenecks|url = http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SolutionsToBottlenecks|website = c2.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimising downtime, setup and changeover time ===
To compensate for being the weakest link in the chain of processes, the bottleneck machine will have to run for longer periods of time. Changeover and setup time should be minimised to allow the machines to run for slightly longer, reducing the impact of the bottleneck.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Minimising downtime by having the bottlenecked machines run from earlier until later is a common strategy for working around the problem, however this does increase the likelihood for the machine to be overloaded and need regular maintenance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Eliminating non-value activities ===
In removing all non-value activities, you reduce the amount of redundant tasks performed by the bottlenecked machine and hence maximize efficiency. Removing the waste operations results in a shorter cycle time hence allowing the machine to complete each process in less time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Provide a constant buffer stock upstream ===
In order to optimise the usage of the machine, the machine should be kept running for as long as possible and hence should never have to wait for materials or stock to increase productivity. This can be achieved by putting a buffer stock in place so that the machine always has some task it can be doing. The down side to that inventory space will be needed to store the buffer for when the machine before it in the chain of processes is working.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Preventing bottlenecks ==
Preventing bottlenecks would be ideal to avoid having to manage and resolve them in the future. There are ways to work around them when planning the production environment. Giving employees free rein over minor decision making will allow them to make the decision they feel is most efficient, and being operators of the machine, their experience will allow them to become specialised in the use of the machine over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prevent Performance Bottlenecks {{!}} Construction Staffing Firm|url = http://www.staffccs.com/2015/07/20/prevent-performance-bottlenecks-on-the-job-site/|website = CCS Construction Staffing|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-training employees will increase adaptability in the production line and hence reduce potential downtime in the future. Hiring high performance employees will reduce the possibility for bottlenecks to be formed by underperforming employees who are inefficient at using their assigned machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Avoid Bottlenecks in the Workplace|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/avoid-bottlenecks-workplace-25556.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning for a higher potential output when designing the production environment is crucial in the long run for occurrences of larger orders when there is need to run all the machinery. Having all the machinery running at full capacity is not always ideal due to situations where malfunctions occur and production is halted. Having inspiring leaders who having a strong understanding in how to keep production smooth will allow greater control of all the different processes in the chain of production. Taking into account the layout of the different processes can also increase efficiency as it minimises delay caused in the transportation stage. The use of a proper layout can reduce the overhead of machines and can reduce material handling time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CLASS 1, PRODUCTION BOTTLENECKS|url = http://www.quelchnet.com/WEB5820/CL-1.htm|website = www.quelchnet.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishment of standardized exchanged protocols can minimise the potential for future bottlenecks to occur through minimising down time. This increases efficiency by reducing any potential confusion between different sectors and hence reduces the possibility for delays of the arrival of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Types of Bottlenecks|url = https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch2en/conc2en/types_of_bottlenecks.html|website = people.hofstra.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Static and dynamic systems and shifting bottlenecks ==
A static bottleneck is where no random or unexpected fluctuations occur which would happen during either a changeover or a breakdown of the system. A static system does not change in behavior and hence the system stays constant. Finding a bottleneck in a static system is very simple, it is simply the machine or process with the longest constant cycle time. Static systems do not exist in reality as no matter what, there will always be a slight fluctuation in cycle time. This is because there is no way to prevent any fluctuation from occurring to slow the system down. An example of this could be a power shortage or a natural disaster.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Shifting Bottlenecks {{!}} AllAboutLean.com|url = http://www.allaboutlean.com/shifting-bottlenecks/|website = AllAboutLean.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior of any system is liable to any random event and hence all systems are dynamic. Dynamic systems can be divided into two main groups: Stable and unstable. The significant difference in the context of dynamic systems, is that the bottlenecks can shift. The speed of which a bottleneck shifts depending on the buffer between the processes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Bottlenecks shift when its location of work center in the production area changes, and this leads to control problems due to the significant delay in output. Shifting bottlenecks are a result of inevitable unexpected events for which no planning is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1937-5956.1994.tb00107.x/asset/j.1937-5956.1994.tb00107.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=igl9faq1&amp;s=7565a310e6b66437e880a5d07d21ac4b7487cd59|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1937-5956.1994.tb00107.x/asset/j.1937-5956.1994.tb00107.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=igl9faq1&amp;s=7565a310e6b66437e880a5d07d21ac4b7487cd59|doi = 10.1111/j.1937-5956.1994.tb00107.x/asset/j.1937-5956.1994.tb00107.x.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steps suggested to avoid or prevent shifting bottlenecks are:

Step 1) Re-evaluate the maximum load of every machine, process or work center when accepting a new order.

Step 2) Find the bottleneck in the system and identify its surplus capacity.

Step 3) Fill the bottlenecks surplus capacity.

Step 4) Find out the release time of the material as a result of the new bottlenecks scheduling.

Through following these steps, the order production will be completed in the shortest possible time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Study of the Shifting Production Bottleneck: Possible Causes and Solutions|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4125664|journal = IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics, 2006.

'''Brainsworking''' refers to a strategy in [[business development]], based on the capacity to transfer [[knowledge]] from wide and diverse fields of experience, connect them and create entirely new and innovative results with the goal to foster sustainable [[business development]] (which also includes [[career|personal development]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[creativity]] and [[innovation]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://businessnetworksmanagement.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html Business, Networks, Management blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, a [[word play]] on [[brain]]s and [[social network|networking]], has been created by [[Austria]]n entrepreneur and [[Chief networking officer]] [[Selma Prodanovic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2950200 Article on Brainsworking in ''Der Standard'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept includes the ability to use [[networking intelligence]] and connected thinking skills in sharing and creating new knowledge in fostering development. Brainsworking understands networking as going beyond contact collection, but rather as interacting visions and ideas. It can also be used as a tool for [[sustainable development|sustainable human development]], as it builds on the fact that each human being is unique and has a unique [[competitive advantage]] to bring into the knowledge exchange network and contribute to sustainable progress in that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brainswork.at/html_englisch/brainswork_institute.htm# |title=Brainswork |access-date=2009-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815063833/http://www.brainswork.at/html_englisch/brainswork_institute.htm# |archive-date=2009-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Business History Review''''' is a scholarly quarterly published by [[Cambridge University Press]] for [[Harvard Business School]]. ''Business History Review'' is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering the field of business history. It was established in 1954 by Harvard University Press as the continuation of the ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = JSTOR: All Volumes and Issues - Browse - The Business History Review|url = https://www.jstor.org/journal/busihistrevi|website = www.jstor.org|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is one of the leading scholarly journals in the field of [[business history]] alongside ''[[Enterprise &amp; Society]]'' and ''[[Business History (journal)|Business History]]''.

The ''Business History Review'' traces it origins to 1926 with the publication of Harvard’s ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society''. The Bulletin aimed “to encourage and aid the study of the evolution of business in all periods and in all countries” and devoted much space to describing the growing archival collections of [http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/ Harvard’s Baker Library]. Henrietta Larson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Henrietta M. Larson Is Dead; Former Professor at Harvard|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/01/obituaries/henrietta-m-larson-is-dead-former-professor-at-harvard.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1983-09-01|access-date = 2015-08-12|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''Guide to Business History'' (1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guide to Business History — Henrietta M.

In 1954, the ''Bulletin'' changed its name to ''Business History Review'' and took its current format of publishing peer-reviewed research articles and book reviews.  In these years, the intellectual framework of the field of business history was defined by the work of [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred D. Chandler Jr.]], who published 11 research articles in the journal.  One of the most popular (with 212 Google Scholar cites) was his 1959 piece “The Beginnings of ‘Big Business’ in American Industry,” which explored the question of why large, vertically integrated [[corporations]] were formed in the late nineteenth-century and why they took the structure they did. Another highly cited article (240 Google Scholar cites) from 1970 was “The Emerging Organizational Synthesis in American History” by Louis Galambos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Louis Galambos {{!}} Department of History {{!}} Johns Hopkins University|url = http://history.jhu.edu/directory/louis-galambos/|website = history.jhu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also focused on explaining the growth of bureaucratic structures in the United States.

In 1974, ''Business History Review'' published its first special issue on the [[multinational corporation]].  Included in the issue was an article on oil companies operating in South America by Mira Wilkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mira Wilkins|url = http://economics.fiu.edu/people/emeritus-faculty/mira-wilkins/|website = Department of Economics|accessdate = 2015-08-12|first = John|last = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered the field of international business history. The journal also expanded its focus beyond the workings of business enterprise to cover business-government relations.  In 1975, [[Thomas K. McCraw]], who edited the journal from 1994 to 2005, published “Regulation in America: A Review Article.” In 2011, the current editors, Walter A. Friedman and [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)|Geoffrey Jones]] (academic), listed the ''BHR''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s core subjects as innovation, globalization, entrepreneurship, business and the environment, business and government, and business and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Business History: Time for Debate|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0007680511000201|journal = Business History Review|date = 2011-03-01|issn = 2044-768X|pages = 1–8|volume = 85|issue = 01|doi = 10.1017/S0007680511000201|first = Walter A.|last = Friedman|first2 = Geoffrey|last2 = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the journal had an impact factor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Journal Citation Reports - IP &amp; Science - Thomson Reuters|url = http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/analytical/jcr/|website = wokinfo.com|accessdate = 2015-08-12|first = Thomson|last = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; of .625 (with a 5-year impact factor of .895) and was rated as a 4 by the British Academic Journal Guide (a 4* is the highest rating).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Academic Journal Guide 2015 - Chartered Association of Business Schools|url = http://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide-2015/|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Business Motivation Model''' ('''BMM''') in [[enterprise architecture]] provides a scheme and structure for developing, communicating, and managing [[business plan]]s in an organized manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/BMM/1.1/PDF/|title=BMM 1.1|work=omg.org|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Business Motivation Model does all of the following:
* identifies factors that motivate the establishing of business plans;
* identifies and defines the elements of business plans; and 
* indicates how all these factors and elements inter-relate.

== History ==
Initially developed by the Business Rules Group (BRG),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2005, the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) voted to accept the Business Motivation Model as the subject of a Request for Comment (RFC).  This meant that the OMG was willing to consider the Business Motivation Model as a specification to be adopted by the OMG, subject to comment from any interested parties.  Adoption as an OMG specification carries the intention that the Business Motivation Model would, in time, be submitted to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) as a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/bmm.shtml|title=BRG:  Business Motivation Model|work=businessrulesgroup.org|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008 version 1.0 was released by OMG.

In May 2015, version 1.3 of BMM specification &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omg.org/spec/BMM/1.3/ version 1.3 of BMM specification]&lt;/ref&gt; was released and as of May 2015 it is the latest stable release.

== Elements ==
"BMM captures business requirements across different dimensions to rigorously capture and justify why the business wants to do something, what it is aiming to achieve, how it plans to get there, and how it assesses the result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/0401_amsden/|title=Capturing requirements with Business Motivation Model, IBM Rational RequisitePro, and IBM Rational Software Modeler|work=ibm.com|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main elements of BMM are:
* Ends: ''What'' (as opposed to ''how'') the business wants to accomplish
* Means: ''How'' the business intends to accomplish its ''ends''
* Directives: The ''rules'' and ''policies'' that ''constrain'' or ''govern'' the available means
* Influencers: Can cause changes that affect the organization in its employment of its means or achievement of its ends. Influencers are ''neutral'' by definition.
* Assessment: A ''judgment'' of an Influencer that affects the organization's ability to achieve its ends or use its means.

'''Business acquisition''' is the process of acquiring a [[company]] to build on strengths or weaknesses of the acquiring company.  A [[merger]] is similar to an acquisition but refers more strictly to combining all of the interests of both companies into a stronger single company. The end result is to grow the business in a quicker and more profitable manner than normal organic growth would allow.  

==Process==
The process begins with defining the type of [[business]] that would make a good acquisition.  Generally businesses within the same segment or a highly complementary market segment are targeted. Once defined the target business is approached and if interest is shown [[due diligence]] is performed to ascertain the financial and other conditions of the business.

When the financial terms are agreed upon, and the contract is signed the merger portion of the acquisition begins.  Overlapping processes, personnel and products are evaluated and the better-performing pieces are retained.

==Single business acquisitions and split and sell==
A single acquisition refers to one company buying the assets and operations of another company and absorbing what is needed while simply discarding duplicated or unnecessary pieces of the acquired business.  "Split and sell" acquisitions involve buying an entire business in order to gain one or two pieces of the business.  The acquiring business may wish to retain the customer list and a product line, while moving manufacturing and other production related duties to an existing line.  In this case the excess is often sold off to recapture some of the acquisition cost.

==Affiliate acquisitions==
Businesses that use affiliates to sell and market their products may find themselves in the position of losing control of the marketing portion.  This presents a danger as the entire [[business cycle]] is dependent on the [[sales cycle]], which is now external to the business.  In this scenario the acquiring business may be forced into paying a premium to the affiliate, to regain control of the process without upsetting current customers and cash flow.  In rare instances the [[affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]] will gain so much influence that it can purchase the parent company.

== Risks ==
There are many risks related to business acquisition and a number of mergers or acquisition fail ending up inducing higher operating costs. There are a set of criteria that are usually followed to know if a business is a good target for acquisition such as : having operative processes, a profitable and documented customer acquisition strategy, good profits, a good customer retention strategy, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2653">'''Business correspondence''' means the exchange of information in a written format for the process of business activities. Business correspondence can take place between organizations, within organizations or between the customers and the organization. The correspondence refers to the written communication between persons. Hence oral communication or face to face communication is not a business correspondance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's guide to business correspondence.|year=1993|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield, Mass.|isbn=0-87779-131-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need for written communication==
# Maintaining a proper relationship.
# Serves as evidence.
# Create and maintain [[Good faith|goodwill]].
# Inexpensive and convenient.
# Formal communication.
# Independent of [[interpersonal skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=L.

==Types of correspondence==

===Business letters===
[[Business letter]]s are the most formal method of communication following specific formats. They are addressed to a particular person or organization. A good business letter follows the seven C's of [[communication]]. The different types of business letters used based on their context are as follows,
# Letters of inquiry
# Letters of claim/complaints
# Letters of application
# Letters of approval/dismissal
# Letters of recommendations
# Letters of promise.
Official letters can be handwritten or printed. Modernisation has led to the usage of new means of business correspondence such as E-mail and Fax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Scott|title=Business communication for success|year=2010|publisher=Flat World Knowledge|location=Nyack, NY|isbn=978-0-9823618-5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Email===
Email is the latest formal method of business communication. It is the most widely used method of written communication usually done in a conversational style. It is used when there is a need to communicate to large audience in an organization.

===Memorandum===
Memorandum is a document used for internal communication within an organization. Memos may be drafted by management and addressed to other employees, and it is sent with the money draft. Memos are sent to several people in a team when important business matters need to be updated to them or to a single person to have a written record of the informations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24641">'''Customer Configuration Updating''' (CCU) is a [[software development]] method for structuring the process of providing customers with new versions of products and updates production. This method is developed by researchers of the [[Utrecht University]].

This article is about the delivery phase of the CCU method. Delivery concerns the process which starts at the moment a product is finished until the actual shipping of the product to the customer.

== Introduction to the delivery process ==

As described in the general entry of CCU, the delivery phase is the second phase of the CCU method. In figure one the CCU method is depicted. The phases of CCU that are not covered in this article are concealed by a transparent grey rectangle.

As can be seen in figure one, the delivery phase is in between the release phase and the deployment phase. A software vendor develops and releases a software product and afterwards it has to be transported to the customer. This phase is the delivery process. This process is highly complex because the vendor often has to deal with a product which has multiple versions, variable features, dependency on external products, and different kinds of [[distribution (business)|distribution]] options. The CCU method helps the software vendor in structuring this process.

In figure 2, the [[process-data diagram]] of the delivery phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side you can see the meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: [[Software package (installation)|software package]], system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package just has to contain 1 software package. On the left side of the picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.

The tables that describe the concepts of the meta-data model and the activities of the process-data model are presented beneath figure 2.

=== Table of concepts ===
The table of concepts contains all concepts used in the meta-data model with their explanations along with the source from which the explanations are derived.

== Package software ==

In order to deliver the developed product to the customer, the vendor needs to package the different components of its product into a package. By doing this, the customer will receive all the information and [[software components]] at once fulfilling all its needs. After combining all elements into one package the software vendor will carefully have to check if the package is complete. The package will have to provide the customer with all the tools and information to use the product. When this is not the case the software vendor will get a lot of questions from its customers which will consume a lot of time. It is therefore very important that the package is checked carefully before it is shipped. The package can be a physical combination of different elements packed into for example a box, but it can also be a digital combination of files which contain all the elements. Within the CCU process it is stated that a package will consist of five elements, being: [[Software package (installation)|software package]], system description, manual, and license and management information. In the following paragraphs is explained how these elements fit into the CCU delivery phase.

=== Software package ===
One of the elements of the package will be the [[Software package (installation)|software package]]. The software package is a package in itself, because it consists of the different [[software components]] that together form the product. In contrast with the overall package, the software package is always a technical package in which all the files needed are combined in order to run the software product.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of tools which can perform this packaging are: [http://www.lokigames.com/ Loki-Update], [http://www.kleemann.org/rpm-update/oldindex.html/ RPM-update] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221051432/http://www.kleemann.org/rpm-update/oldindex.html# |date=2006-02-21 }}, [http://swup.trustix.org/ SWUP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512162529/http://swup.trustix.org/# |date=2006-05-12 }} and [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/portage-manual.xml/ Portage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021012956/http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/portage-manual.xml# |date=2004-10-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another concept of the software package is the version. This keeps track of the modifications made to the software product. By relating it to the software package the vendor and the customer are able to keep track of the functionality and properties of the product the customer is using.

=== System description ===
It is a general description of what the product and its functionalities. In addition it will also describe of what components, the product consists and how these are related to other product software already in place. In case of a software [[patch (computing)|update]] it will for example describe how the previous version of the software is modified by this product. Besides this, it will also describe the requirements needed to run the software product properly. For example what other products and configurations need to be in place in order to let this product run properly.

=== Manual ===
The manual is the document that will provide the customer with guidance in deploying and using the product.

=== License ===
The license is in this case a [[Software license agreement]] in which is stated how the customer is permitted to use the product. For example it can state how many users are permitted to use the software product. In this situation the license agreement is a contract or a certificate which is the customers prove of its using permits. The software vendor has its own part of the agreement which in most cases is stored in a system. An elaboration of this part can be found at the receive [[feedback]] section of this article. The license agreement shipped to the customer can be a digital document as well as a physical document.

=== Management information ===
This piece of information should contain the information that is relevant for managing the system at the customer site. In many cases this information is already part of the manual. However in particular situations this information is meant only for the management of the system and not for the users of the system and is therefore supplied as a separate document.

== Distribution ==

After the package is assembled it needs to be [[distribution (business)|distributed]] to the customers. This section within the delivery process is about the actual delivery of the package to the customers.

=== Offline vs Online ===
The software distribution of a product can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this data carrier, or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package as a whole is a physical product. In an online situation the entire package needs to be in a digital form. The consequences on the [[distribution (business)|distribution]] process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both [[distribution (business)|distribution]] channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.

=== Preparation of distribution ===

After a new package is assembled, the customer needs to be made aware of the new release. In the process-data model this is being depicted as a loop which states advertising the update until the customers are being properly informed. Besides this, the package ready for delivery, needs to be stored in a repository for the online [[distribution (business)|distribution]]. In addition the vendor needs to create transfer channels. For the online [[distribution (business)|distribution]] this means that the vendor needs to create online channels to its repository. In most cases this means that a link to the product on the website of the vendor is created. In case of updates it is largely applicable that the current version of the software product at the customer site automatically checks the [[wikt:repository|repository]] for new updates of the product. In case of offline [[distribution (business)|distribution]], the vendor needs to create physical transfer channels. This can be shops or just a contract with a courier company.

=== The actual distribution ===
The [[distribution (business)|distribution]] begins with the request for a product by the customer. This can be done automatically when the current product of the customer searches for an update at the online repository. The customer can also manually do a request for a product via the website of the vendor. A third option is that the customer does the request via telephone or e-mail.

When the vendor is aware of the customer request it will determine the customer needs. By checking what the customer current configuration is and what the customer desires. This process can also take place automatically by checking the customer configuration in the [[configuration management]] system. More information on this system is provided in the next chapter. When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product it is necessary to determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the [[configuration management]] system. When the configuration of the customer appears to be insufficient the customer is informed about this. For example the vendor can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM) system of the vendor is updated. There is more information about this in the chapter about CRM.

When the customer configuration is sufficient the vendor will check the current license of the customer. If the customer does not have a proper license for the requested product the license needs to be obtained. The customer will be informed about this and the CRM system will be updated again. If the customer has the proper license or wants to buy the proper license along with the product, the product is delivered to the customer.

== Software configuration management ==
The [[Software Configuration Management]] system, is a system at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the configurations at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor will be able to give the customer particular service when it needs a new product. In the software [[configuration management]] system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates are already being done, is stored. In some cases it is possible that the vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be [[computer configuration|configuration data]], some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the [[feedback]] that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this [[feedback]] can be found in the CCU phase activation and usage.

By storing all this information the vendor can determine the customer needs very precisely whenever a customer requests a product or an update. As already stated the vendor can also easily inform the customer about some adaptations the customer needs to make to its configuration in order to let the product function properly. Another advantage of storing this information in a system is that it will ease the process of online delivery. The checking of the configuration needs and constraints can all be done automatically when a customer does a request.

== CRM system ==
The [[customer relationship management]] system contains all kinds of data about the customers of a company. In this article we will discuss the function of this customer data in the CCU delivery process. Information about the license agreement between the customer and the software vendor is stored in the CRM system. In the meta-data model this [[wikt:repository|repository]] and online [[distribution (business)|distribution]] is linked to the CRM system this can again be done automatically. The system will check if the license of a customer is sufficient to obtain a certain product or update.

== Receiving feedback and updating the systems ==

In order to keep all the described systems up-to-date at the vendor site it is important that the vendor receives a lot of

== Example ==
An example of a successful application of the CCU method can be found at Exact Software (ES). ES is a manufacturer of accounting and [[enterprise resource planning]] software based in the Netherlands. ES has combined [[Product Data Management]] (PDM), [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM) and [[Software Configuration Management]] (SCM) in order to maintain the configuration at the customer site in a better and less complex way. ES has a module in its CRM software that contains all contracts of each customer. This is linked to their PDM system. Every contract corresponds to files that can be downloaded for a new version or update of a previous version. In the delivery phase this means that the customers are able to obtain all the products through an online connection. So ES sells contracts (licenses) and stores them into their CRM system, the delivery of the actual products can be done by the customers themselves completely automated requiring little effort. The PDM system is on its turn linked to the SCM system which keeps track of the configurations the customers are using. In the delivery phase this means that ES is able to automatically determine the customer needs whenever a customer does a request.

==Commonwealth systems==
In the U.S. a certificate of incorporation is usually used as an alternative description of a corporation's '''[[articles of incorporation]]'''. The certificate of incorporation, or articles of incorporation, form a major constituent part of the constitutional documents of the corporation. In [[English law|English]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] legal systems, a certificate of incorporation is usually a simple certificate issued by the relevant government registry as confirmation of the due incorporation and valid existence of the company.

In other [[common law]] legal systems, the certificate of incorporation has less legal significance. Although it has been held by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''[[Cotman v Brougham]]'' (1918) AC 514, that because the issue the certificate of incorporation is conclusive evidence of the formation of a company, the issuance of the certificate overrides any irregularities which may have occurred during the formation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cotman v.

'''Chad Troutwine''' (born May 23, 1968) is an American [[Independent film]] producer and Co-Founder and [[CEO]] of [[Veritas Prep]].

==Early life and education==
As a child, Troutwine's parents encouraged his entrepreneurial spirit and placed a high value on education. Troutwine earned a perfect score on the [[Stanford Achievement Test]], and graduated high school at the age of sixteen. Troutwine earned his BA from [[Arizona State University]] at nineteen, and went on to earn a JD from the [[University of Missouri]], graduating with honors, an [[MBA]] from the [[Yale School of Management]], and received a master's degree in Public Administration from the [[Harvard Kennedy School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veritasprep.com/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the Team - Veritas Prep|first=|last=VeritasPrep|website=www.veritasprep.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==

While at Yale, Troutwine and [[Markus Moberg]], launched [[Veritas Prep]], a GMAT preparation and MBA admissions consulting company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2009/04/23/qa-som-grads-find-success-in-test-prep/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918224624/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2009/04/23/qa-som-grads-find-success-in-test-prep/ |archivedate=2012-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/node/53396|title=A Devilish time on tap in NCAAs|first=Jennifer|last=Scuteri|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Veritas Prep has become the world's largest privately owned test preparation and admissions consulting company, and now prepares students for the [[SAT]], [[ACT (test)|ACT]], and [[GRE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veritasprep.com/blog/|title=GMAT Prep - SAT Prep - Admissions Consulting - Veritas Prep Blog|website=www.veritasprep.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his entrepreneurial endeavors, [[Forbes magazine]] named Troutwine their 2002 Forbes Future Capitalist of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndeclub.org/article/id:3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727114349/http://www.ndeclub.org/article/id%3A3 |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later, [[Entrepreneur magazine]] featured Troutwine and Moberg as Top 20 Trailblazers and Trendsetters for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/goforward/forwardthinkers/slideshow/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110050108/http://www.entrepreneur.com/goforward/forwardthinkers/slideshow/index.html |archive-date=2010-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Troutwine co-founded Freakonomics Media, the Freakonomics franchise grew from its original book to a movie, radio show, more books, and a multimedia website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2011/01/14/freakonomics-leaving-ny-times-to-start-own-venture/|title=Freakonomics Leaving NY Times to Start Own Venture|first=Jeff|last=Bercovici|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Troutwine joined Dan O'Meara and Chris Romano at the Green Film Company, a New York-based production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/business/media/05freak.html|title=‘Freakonomics’ May Find Hidden Side of Documentary: Profit|first=Michael|last=Cieply|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Magnolia Pictures]] released his documentary adaptation of the New York Times Bestseller [[Freakonomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2009/march/200014.html|title=A Better Way to Prepare|first=Dennis|last=Romero|date=10 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Closing Night gala film at the 2010 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118017025.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562 ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Troutwine's documentary, ''[[Print the Legend]]'', won a special jury award at the 2014 [[SXSW]] Film Festival.

The '''chief operating officer''' ('''COO'''), also called the '''chief operations officer''', is one of the highest-ranking executive positions in an organization, comprising part of the "[[C-Suite]]". The COO is responsible for the daily operation of the [[company]],&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coo.asp|title=Chief Operating Officer – COO|accessdate=2011-02-08|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and routinely reports to the highest-ranking executive, usually the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO).&lt;ref name=Levinson1993&gt;{{Citation|title=Between CEO and COO|jstor=4165123|year=1993|author=Levinson, Harry|journal=Academy of Management Executive|pages=71–83|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The COO is usually the [[second in command]] at the firm, especially if the highest-ranking executive is the [[Chairman]] and [[chief executive officer|CEO]].

==Responsibilities and similar titles==
Unlike other [[C-Suite]] positions, which tend to be defined according to commonly designated responsibilities across most companies, the COO job tends to be defined in relation to the specific CEO with whom they work, given the close working relationship of these two individuals.&lt;ref name=hbr2006&gt;{{Citation|title=Second in Command: The Misunderstood Role of the Chief Operating Officer|url=http://hbr.org/2006/05/second-in-command-the-misunderstood-role-of-the-chief-operating-officer/ar/1|year=2006|journal=Harvard Business Review|pages=70–79|volume=84|issue=5|last1="Miles"|first1=Stephen A.|last2="Bennett"|first2=Nathan|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the selection of a COO is similar to the selection of a [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] or [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] of the United States: power and responsibility structures vary in government and private regimes depending on the style and needs of the President or CEO. Thus, the COO role meets individual expectations and changes as leadership teams adjust.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;

===President===
In a similar vein to the COO, the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "[[C-Suite]]" designation, such as "President and CEO" or "President and COO") is also loosely defined. The President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various Vice Presidents (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. 

Lloyd E. Reuss was President of [[General Motors]] from 1990 to 1992, as the right-hand man of Chairman and CEO [[Robert C. Stempel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Lloyd_and_Mark_Reuss:_Father_and_Son|title=Lloyd and Mark Reuss: Father and Son – Generations of GM|website=history.gmheritagecenter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630175729/https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Lloyd_and_Mark_Reuss:_Father_and_Son|archive-date=2017-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stempel insisted on naming Reuss as company president in charge of North American operations, the board reluctantly agreed but showed their displeasure by not giving Reuss the title of COO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cg.org.cn/english/practice/GM.asp Practice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102021525/http://www.cg.org.cn/english/practice/GM.asp |date=November 2, 2013 }}.

[[Michael Capellas]] was appointed President of [[Hewlett-Packard]] in order to ease its acquisition and integration of [[Compaq]], where Capellas was previously Chairman and CEO.

In 2007, the investment banking firms of [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] each had two presidents (Warren Spector and Alan Schwartz at Bear, Robert Scully and Zoe Cruz at Morgan) reporting to one CEO (who was also chairman of the board); each president was essentially a co-COO (despite the lack of title) overseeing half of the firm's business divisions. Schwartz became sole president of Bear after Spector was ousted, and several months later assumed the position of CEO as well when [[James Cayne]] was forced to resign (Cayne remained chairman).

[[Tom Anselmi]] of [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] was Chief Operating Officer from 2004 until September 6, 2013. Between the departure of [[Richard Peddie]] and the hiring of [[Tim Leiweke]] for the posts of President and CEO, Anselmi added the title of President from September 4, 2012 to June 30, 2013, however he remained COO and did not receive the title of CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Damien|title=Maple Leafs: New era of MLSE intrigue unfolding: Cox|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/article/1252698--a-new-era-of-mlse-intrigue-unfolding|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Fuld]], the chairman and CEO of [[Lehman Brothers]], had a succession of "number twos" under him, usually titled as President and Chief Operating Officer. Chris Pettit was Fuld's second-in-command for two decades until November 26, 1996, when he resigned as President and board member. Pettit lost a power struggle with his deputies (Steve Lessing, Tom Tucker, and Joseph M. Gregory) on March 15 that year that caused him to relinquish its COO title, likely brought about after the three men found about Pettit's extramarital affairs, which violated Fuld's unwritten rules on marriage and social etiquette. Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were appointed co-COOs in 2002, but Jack was demoted to the Office of the Chairman in May 2004 and departed in June 2005 with a severance package of $80&amp;nbsp;million, making Gregory the sole COO. While Fuld was considered the "face" of Lehman brothers, Gregory was in charge of day-to-day operations and he influenced culture to drive the bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/print/?/news/business/52603/|title=Print Page|website=nymag.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was demoted on June 12, 2008 and replaced as President and COO by [[Bart McDade]], who had been serving as head of Equities, and McDade would see Lehman through bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=Ward2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="truell"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/pettit-resigns-as-president-of-lehman-brothers-firm.html?pagewanted=print| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| first=Peter| last=Truell| title=Pettit Resigns as President Of Lehman Brothers Firm| date=November 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas W. LaSorda]] served as President and CEO of [[Chrysler]] from January 1, 2006 to August 5, 2007 while Chrysler was owned by [[Daimler-Benz]]. When [[Cerberus Capital]] bought majority control of Chrysler, [[Bob Nardelli]] was appointed [[Chairman]] and CEO of Chrysler while LaSorda became Vice Chairman and President. Despite the appointment of a second Vice Chairman and President, [[Jim Press]], LaSorda stayed on.&lt;ref name="detnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20090502/AUTO01/905020344/1148/LaSorda+s+legacy+is++unselfish+devotion+ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122054107/http://www.detnews.com/article/20090502/AUTO01/905020344/1148/LaSorda+s+legacy+is++unselfish+devotion+ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-22 |title=He led GM"s quality and lean manufacturing activities as a corporate VP |publisher=The Detroit News |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2014-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/cerberus-buys-chrysler.html |title=The Cerberus Takeover of Chrysler |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaSorda's titles as Vice Chairman and President officially stated that he was in charge of manufacturing, procurement and supply, employee relations, global business development and alliances.

[[The Walt Disney Company]] has used the [[List of management of The Walt Disney Company#Presidents|President and COO]] titles in varied ways for their number two executive.  [[Ron W. Miller]] was President from 1978 to 1984, while serving additionally as CEO for 18 months from 1983 to 84.  [[Frank Wells]] was President from 1984 to 1994, where he reported to the board of directors and not Chairman and CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. When Wells died in a helicopter crash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/obituaries/frank-wells-disney-s-president-is-killed-in-a-copter-crash-at-62.html|title=Frank Wells, Disney's President, Is Killed in a Copter Crash at 62|first=The Associated|last=Press|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; no replacement President was named as his duties were resumed by Eisner. [[Michael Ovitz]] was President from 1995 to 1997, being hired by Eisner and then dismissed not long afterwards. [[Bob Iger]] was President and COO from 2000 to 2005, when he succeeded Eisner as CEO. [[Thomas O. Staggs]] was COO from 2015 to 2016, during that time the senior executive team had a dual reporting structure to both Staggs and Iger; Staggs resigned after the board did not give him assurances that he would succeed as CEO.

[[Manulife]] has used the President and COO titles for separate roles. From June 5 until September 30, 2017, Rocco "Roy" Gori served as President where he oversaw Manulife's global operating businesses, with his subordinates being the general managers of the Canadian, U.S., and Asia Divisions, and the Chief Investment Officer. Gori reported to Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien before additionally assuming the title of CEO on October 1, 2017 upon Guloien's retirement. Linda Mantia, the Chief Operating Officer, reported to the President on Corporate Strategy while continuing to report to the CEO on all other matters including Corporate Development, Analytics, Technology, Marketing, Innovation, Human Resources, Regulatory and Public Affairs, Global Resourcing and Procurement, and the Global Program Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/manulife-appoints-roy-gori-as-president-617424583.html|title=Manulife appoints Roy Gori as President|author=|date=|website=www.newswire.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current situation===
Some modern companies operate without a COO.  For example,  in 2007 almost 58% of [[Fortune 500]] companies did not have a COO.&lt;ref name=Gerut2010&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances the CEO either takes on more roles and responsibilities, or the roles traditionally assigned to the COO are carried out by sub [[C-Suite]] executives. Although the number of COOs has been in decline for the past 10 years, there are reasons to anticipate an increased utilization of the position in the future, including:
* Companies are becoming larger and more complex, making it more difficult for one person alone to have total oversight over the whole organization.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;
* Companies are finding a strong relationship between firm performance and the presence of a COO.&lt;ref name=Marcel2009&gt;{{Citation

* Companies are becoming more deliberate about [[CEO succession]] planning and will use the role to on-board and train successors.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;
* The increase in talent mobility means that the role will likely be used more often as a retention mechanism for key executives who are at risk of moving to a competitor.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;

==Roles and functions==

The role of the COO differs from industry to industry and from organization to organization. Some organizations function without a COO. Others may have two COOs, each assigned to oversee several business lines or divisions, such as [[Lehman Brothers]] from 2002 to 2004 when Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were the co-COOs.&lt;ref name=Ward2010&gt;{{Citation

In the [[manufacturing sector]], the primary role of the COO is routinely one of [[operations management]], meaning that the COO is responsible for the development, design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver the firm's [[product (business)|products]]. The COO is responsible for ensuring that [[business operations]] are efficient and effective and that the proper [[Resource management|management of resources]], [[supply chain management|distribution of goods and services to customers]] and analysis of queue systems is conducted.

Despite the functional diversity associated with the role of COO, there are some common functions the COOs usually perform:
* At the direction of the CEO and Board of Directors, marshaling limited resources to the most productive uses with the aim of creating maximum value for the company's stakeholders
* Developing and cascading the organization's strategy/mission statement to the lower-ranking staff, and implementing appropriate rewards/recognition and coaching/corrective practices to align personnel with company goals
* Planning by prioritizing customer, employee, and organizational requirements
* Maintaining and monitoring staffing, levels, Knowledge-Skills-Attributes (KSA), expectations and motivation to fulfill organizational requirements
* Driving performance measures for the operation (including a consideration of efficiency versus effectiveness), often in the form of dashboards convenient for review of high level key indicators

===COO as successor===
Routinely in large organizations the COO will be the [[heir apparent]] to the CEO.&lt;ref name=Galbraith2009&gt;{{Citation

Either way, the position is used as a training and testing ground for the next CEO.

A 2003 Crist Associates study revealed that only 17% of companies that promote a COO to a CEO replace the COO within the next year.&lt;ref name=Martin2003&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; COOs transitioning into the CEO role often face similar challenges including:
* '''Not being automatically granted the luxury of a "diagnostic period."''' Given that they know the company, COOs turned CEOs are often expected to hit the ground running when in actuality they too need to enter diagnostic mode to fully understand their new role and to see the company from a new perspective.
* '''Finding time to manage a new key stakeholder: The board.''' Many COOs turned CEOs are often surprised how time-intensive managing the Board of Directors can be and must learn to incorporate this important responsibility into an already packed schedule.
* '''Being in the spotlight.''' COOs are used to having the luxury of working "behind the scenes." As CEO, many are surprised to find they have become a "public" figure both inside and outside the organization and must learn how to manage this additional obligation.
* '''Recalibrating their image.''' Often COOs struggle not with the strategy portion of the job itself, but overcoming the perception of other stakeholders that they are an "execution" executive versus a "strategy" executive.&lt;ref name=Miles2010 /&gt;

According to researchers Miles and Bennett, just knowing these common pitfalls can help a COO "heir" better prepare for the transition, thereby avoiding them in totality or ensuring that at least they do not evolve into full derailers once they are in the CEO seat.&lt;ref name=Miles2010 /&gt;

==Relationship with CEO==

Because the COO is often responsible for serving as an information conduit to the CEO, it is essential that the relationship between COO and CEO be a positive one.&lt;ref name=Bennett2008&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trust is the most important ingredient necessary for a CEO-COO relationship to thrive. The CEO must have full confidence that the COO is not making direct passes for their job, can get the work done, and shares their vision (rather than using their trusted spot and access to information to undermine the CEO's strategy or implement his/her own vision). When a relationship built upon trust is created between the CEO and COO, firm performance is improved and shareholder results are strengthened. Seven strategies that are key to building trust in the CEO-COO relationship include:&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2006&gt;{{Citation

# Communication—The CEO has to be comfortable sharing information with the COO and regularly communicating the strategy and any changes to it. Similarly, the COO has to be comfortable regularly providing status updates to the CEO. When communication breaks down, mistrust or misunderstanding is likely to mess up.
# Clear Decision Rights—The COO role appears to work the best when the roles and responsibilities of the COO have been clearly delineated ahead of time and the COO is allowed to make the final decision within pre-agreed upon scope.
# Lock on the Backdoor—The CEO must not undermine the COO's credibility by continually reversing decisions. When employees learn that they can get a different answer by going directly to the CEO as opposed to the COO, the COO role quickly becomes impotent.
# Sharing the Spotlight—In effective CEO-COO relationships, both parties are comfortable with how much "credit" they receive for their work internally, externally, from the Board of Directors, and from each other.
# Fit between CEO &amp; COO—The two individuals must respect each other and effectively partner together. This is not a partnership that can be forced.
# Fit Between the COO &amp; the Position—The selected COO must have the right credentials to carry out the purpose for which the COO role was created (which can include everything from operations expertise to change expertise to having a complementary skill set to the CEO).
# Transparency of Succession Expectations and Timeline—Both parties must understand whether the COO desires the CEO job, whether the COO is in consideration for the top job, and what the timing might be for such a transition.

==Relationship with board of directors==
In addition to having a strong and trusting relationship with the CEO, the COO should also have an effective relationship with the board.&lt;ref name=Miles2007&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good relationship between COO and the board allows the board to better understand and independently judge a potential successor. A strong relationship between the board and the COO also offers the board an additional expert opinion on the health of the company, and status of key initiatives. It benefits the CEO to allow such a relationship to form because it reflects confidence and fosters transparency. It also reinforces that the CEO is capable of developing talent, and helps the CEO to retain the COO by further empowering the individual. A strong relationship benefits the COOs in that they are able to expand their experience as well as their professional network. Additionally, if they are looking to be the next CEO, it allows them to develop credibility with the board. Researchers advise the COO to go beyond simply presenting at board meetings, to ensure they are developing strong one-on-one relationships with each board director.&lt;ref name=Miles2007 /&gt;  Researchers{{Who|date=May 2014}} also urge the COO to develop his or her own voice, independent of the CEO.

==Failure in the COO role==
Any breakdown in trust between the CEO and COO can lead to failure. Additionally, the COO typically has to be a high-level leader who is comfortable being fully in charge. Many executives with the leadership skills necessary to be a top-level COO would prefer to be running their own organization as opposed to taking orders from a CEO.  For COOs who are expecting to serve their time and be promoted to the top spot, their timelines for such a move can often be out of sync with the CEOs, causing a breakdown in the relationship. COOs can also find themselves trapped into being labeled an "operations" person or a "Number 2" as opposed to being seen as a strategic and top-level leader by the Board of Directors, which causes some executives to steer clear of the position.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt; Harry Levinson, Ph.D., effectively summarized the challenges of the COO position: "The relationship between the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer in any organization is fraught with many psychological complexities. Perhaps it is the most difficult of all organizational working relationships because more than others, it is a balancing act on the threshold of power."&lt;ref name=Levinson1993 /&gt;

==Experts and research==
Nathan Bennett and [[Stephen A. Miles]] have published extensively on the subject of the COO. In addition to writing a book dedicated to analyzing this hard-to-understand position,&lt;ref name=shotgun&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miles, Stephen A.|author2=Nathan Bennett|title=Riding shotgun: the role of the COO|publisher=Stanford Business Books|location=Stanford, Calif|year=2006|pages=|isbn=0-8047-5166-8|oclc=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; their research has been published in the ''Harvard Business Review'', ''MIT Management Review'' and Chief Executive.net.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2007 /&gt; Their work focuses on identifying different types of COOs, when the role works to deliver additional value, and when the role fails to produce the desired results.

'''Core (Centralized Online Real-time Exchange) banking''' is a [[banking]] service provided by a group of networked [[Branch (banking)|bank branches]] where customers may access their [[bank account]] and perform basic [[transaction account|transactions]] from any of the member branch offices.

Core banking is often associated with [[retail banking]] and many banks treat the retail customers as their core banking customers. Businesses are usually managed via the [[corporate banking]] division of the institution. Core banking covers basic depositing and lending of money.

Core banking functions will include [[transaction account]]s, [[loan]]s, [[mortgage]]s and [[payment systems|payments]]. Banks make these services available across multiple channels like [[automated teller machine]]s, [[Internet banking]], [[mobile banking]] and branches.&lt;ref name=gartner1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/core-banking-systems/ |title=Core Banking System |accessdate=August 14, 2014 |publisher=Gartner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Banking software]] and network technology allow a bank to centralise its record keeping and allow access from any location.

==History==
Core banking became possible with the advent of computer and telecommunication technology that allowed information to be shared between bank branches quickly and efficiently.

Before the 1970s it used to take at least a day for a transaction to reflect in the real account because each branch had their local servers, and the data from the server in each branch was sent in a batch to the servers in the data center only at the end of the day (EOD).

Over the following 30 years most banks moved to core banking applications to support their operations creating a Centralized Online Real-time Exchange (or Environment) (CORE&lt;ref&gt;https://www.acronymfinder.com/Centralized-Online-Real_Time-Exchange-(banking)-(CORE).html&lt;/ref&gt;). This  meant that all the bank's branches could access applications from centralized [[data center]]s. Deposits made were reflected immediately on the bank's servers, and the customer could withdraw the deposited money from any of the bank's branches.

== Software  ==
Advancements in [[Internet]] and information technology reduced manual work in banks and increasing efficiency. Computer software is developed to perform core operations of banking like recording of transactions, [[passbook]] maintenance, interest calculations on [[loans]] and [[deposits]], customer records, balance of payments and withdrawal. This software is installed at different branches of bank and then interconnected by means of [[computer network]]s based on [[telephones]], [[satellite]] and the Internet.

Gartner defines a core banking system as a back-end system that processes daily banking transactions, and posts updates to accounts and other financial records.&lt;ref name=gartner1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Core banking systems typically include deposit, loan and credit-processing capabilities, with interfaces to general ledger systems and reporting tools. Core banking applications are often one of the largest single expense for banks and legacy software are a major issue in terms of allocating resources.  Spending on these systems is based on a combination of service-oriented architecture and supporting technologies.

Many banks implement custom applications for core banking. Others implement or customize commercial [[independent software vendor]] packages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/178_194/can-big-four-core-banking-vendors-oligopoly-be-broken-1062654-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Systems integrators like [[Cognizant]], [[EdgeVerve Systems Limited]], [[Capgemini]], [[Accenture]], [[IBM]] and [[Tata Consultancy Services]] implement these core banking packages at banks.

Choosing right core banking solution is again a tough task for banks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kimayainfotech.com/core-banking-solution-how-to-select-right-one-Part-I|title=Core Banking Solution, how to select right one-Part I|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kimayainfotech.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; its not always that easy to select right core banking solution.

Open source Technology in core banking solution or software can help banks to maintain their productivity and profitability at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kimayainfotech.com/open-source-technology-for-core-banking-solution-&amp;-software|title=Open Source Technology for Core Banking Solution &amp; Software|website=www.kimayainfotech.com|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Providers  ==
While larger financial institutions may implement their own custom core, [[community bank|community banks]] and [[credit union|credit unions]] tend to outsource their core systems to system providers. While there is no consensus or a public register on the actual Core Banking Providers, various [[Market research company|market research companies]] like [[Gartner]] or [[Forrester Research]] release annual deal surveys mentioning platform deals &lt;ref name="Forrester List"&gt;https://www.forrester.com/webinar/Global+Banking+Platform+Deals+Survey+2016/-/E-WEB21123&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corporate development''' refers to the planning and execution of strategies to meet organizational objectives. The kinds of activities falling under corporate development may include management team recruitment, phasing in or out of markets or products, arranging strategic alliances, identifying and acquiring companies ([[Mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A]]), securing [[Corporate finance|corporate financing]], [[Divestment|divesting of assets or divisions]], and management of intellectual property. The activities encompassed are often the role of the [[CEO]]. 

==Process==

Corporate strategy depends on the circumstances of a company and the area where development is desired. Corporate development is usually a process that takes place over an extended period of time and may be adjusted or refined as the project moves forward

==Reshaping management==

One of the manifestations of corporate development has to do with reshaping the management arm of the corporation. This may involve a process of phasing certain management positions out of the existing structure or creating new positions in an effort to strengthen the management team. As part of this type of approach, corporate development may also demand that one or more current managers are released from the company and replaced with people who possess skills required to move the company forward. When this is the case, the corporate development team will handle the functions of recruitment and evaluation of potential hires.

==Growing the company==

The process of corporate development can also be applied to the task of growing the company through mergers and acquisitions. In this scenario, the project development will involve identifying potential target companies for acquisitions or unions resulting in a new and more aggressive corporation. The team will consider all possible outcomes from any given potential merger or acquisition and attempt to project if the action is likely to result in positive growth or could possibly impair the company permanently.

Just as a management team may be revamped, corporate development may also be employed to change the current focus for clients. This may mean looking into the potential for breaking into new markets with existing products or developing complementary products that will allow this type of expansion. Corporate development strategy would monitor the trends associated with a corporation's products or services and helps the corporation establish strategies to find more customers. In addition, corporate development works to maximize the profits of a corporation by figuring out the appropriate pricing for a given good or service. A corporate development team also leads discussions with sales department heads regarding how to market corporate goods, organize marketing campaigns, analyze market research and incorporate any customer advice or complaints into marketing strategies in such cases; extensive industry specific business experience is often preferred which is why companies may hire an external firm to help them engage in such moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomaguide.com/articles/Corporate_Development_Manager_Career_Profile.html |title=Corporate Development Manager Careers: Salary &amp; Job Description |publisher=Diplomaguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the status of the base market, corporate development may also look at shifting away from a shrinking consumer market while seeking market share in a different consumer market with newer products. For example, many typewriter manufacturers during the 1980s and 1990s slowly phased out their core business and began to focus more on computer parts and accessories as a way to continue operations.

==Need for specialists==
Particularly in larger companies, corporate development is provided as a charter for a particular executive or team. In these cases, the opportunities and initiatives are numerous enough to justify specialists, instead of being delegated to the office of the CEO and line of business executives. When focused on product or financial issues, corporate development executives often have [[MBA]], [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA]] or [[Certified Practising Accountant|CPA]] credentials. Often the internal corporate development executives come from a legal or investment banking background, due to the complex contractual and valuation issues associated with many transactions.

'''Corporate sourcing''' refers to a system where divisions of companies coordinate the [[procurement]] and distribution of materials, parts, equipment, and supplies for the organization.  This is a [[supply chain]], [[purchasing]]/[[procurement]], and [[inventory]] function. This enables [[bulk discounting]], [[auditing]], and [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley compliance]].

Duties of a corporate sourcing agent include:
#Coordinating all activities related to [[procurement]] of a [[commodity]] beginning with intent to purchase through delivery
#Analyzing the requirements of the commodity, including preliminary specifications, preferred supplier, and date commodity is needed
#Soliciting and evaluating proposals for the requested commodity. Investigating and/or interviewing potential suppliers to determine if they meet the specified requirements.

Some of corporate sourcing agents:
[[Richman Chemical]], [[Onetouch]], [[Worldwide Brands]], [[SAOS]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2226">'''Critical process parameters''' (CPP) in pharmaceutical manufacturing are key variables affecting the production process. CPPs are attributes that are monitored to detect deviations in standardized production operations and product output quality or changes in [[Critical Quality Attributes]]. Those attributes with a higher impact on CQAs should be prioritized and held in a stricter state of control. The manufacturer should conduct test to set acceptable range limits of the determined CPPs and define acceptable process variable variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Determining Criticality-Process Parameters and Quality Attributes Part I: Criticality as a Continuum|url=http://www.biopharminternational.com/biopharm/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=830461&amp;pageID=1|publisher=biopharminternational|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operational conditions within this range are considered acceptable operational standards. Any deviation from the acceptable range will be indicative of issues within the process and the subsequent production of substandard products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Process Parameters and Critical Quality Attributes: Why Does the Selection Process Take so Long?|url=http://www.propharmagroup.com/blog/critical-process-parameters-and-critical-quality-attributes-why-does-selection-process-take-so|publisher=ProPharma Group|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data relating to CPP should be recorded, stored, and analyzed by the manufacturer. CPP variables and ranges should be reevaluated after careful analysis of historical CPP data. Identifying CPPs is done in stage one of [[Process Validation]]: [[Process design]] are an essential part of a manufacturing control strategy.

One method of defining CPPs is to look at the effect of certain production processes on critical quality attributes. Those production parameters which have a measurable effect on those quality attributes that have been identified as critical can be considered CPPs and must always be in a state of control.

[[File:Customs-House-Brisbane-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Customs House in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''custom house''' or '''customs house''' was a building housing the offices for the government officials who processed the paperwork associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country.  Customs officials also collected [[customs (tax)|customs duty]] on imported goods.

The custom house was typically located in a [[seaport]] or in a city on a major river, with access to the ocean.  These cities acted as a [[port of entry]] into a country.  The government stationed officials at such locations to collect taxes and regulate commerce.

Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term "custom house" is now often an historical anachronism.  There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings.

In the [[United Kingdom]], since 1386, the phrase ''custom house'' has been in use over the term ''customs house''.  This was after a "[[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]]" was erected at Wool Wharf in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Ward]], to contain just the officials of the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.  The singular form was used even though in later years the Custom House was the location of other Customs officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Graham |date=1980|title=Something To Declare|page=6|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co.

== Required skills ==
Customer service representative positions often require at least a high school diploma. Representatives often have some experience with [[office software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Customer_Service_Representative_(CSR)/Hourly_Rate |title=Average Customer Service Representative (CSR) Hourly Pay |date=November 5, 2018 |website=[[PayScale]] |accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First impressions are very important in this job. The moment one begins to communicate with a customer, one is being judged. The way one communicates with a customer will not only influence how the conversation develops, but the overall impression of the CSR and the organization they represent. There are five key customer service skills that define the best CSRs:      
* Ability to establish rapport with customers. 
* [[Problem solving]]     
* Strong [[Understanding|listening skills]]    
* Strong commercial awareness     
* [[Team work]]ing

== Salary ==

Although earnings may vary, the median hourly average for CSRs in 2017 was $15.81, in the US.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt; People in this job typically have less than 20 years' experience. Skills that are associated with high pay for this job are those in customer service metrics, [[Microsoft Office]], [[customer relationship management]], and oral and verbal communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">'''Earnings''' are the net benefits of a [[corporation]]'s operation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Eccles, Robert H. Herz, E. Mary Keegan, David M. H. Phillips: The Value Reporting Revolution: Moving Beyond the Earnings Game; Price-Waterhouse-Coopers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earnings is also the amount on which corporate [[tax]] is due.  For an analysis of specific aspects of corporate operations several more specific terms are used as [[Earnings before interest and taxes|EBIT]] -- earnings before interest and taxes, [[EBITDA]]  - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

Many alternative terms for earnings are in common use, such as [[income]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. These terms in turn have a variety of definitions, depending on their context and the objectives of the authors. For instance, the [[IRS]] uses the term profit to describe earnings, whereas for the corporation the profit it [[form 10-K|report]]s is the amount left after [[tax]]es are taken out.  Many economic discussions use principles derived from [[Karl Marx]] &lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: Das Kapital, Kritik der Politischen Oekonmie; 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith: The Wealth of Nations; 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the rise of the importance of [[intellectual capital]] &lt;ref&gt;Gordon Smith and Russell Parr: Intellectual Property, 4th edition; Wiley 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; affects such analyses.

==Routine earnings==
Routine earnings or [[commodity]]-based earnings are those that can be achieved by application of assets that are those that can be achieved by any business that employs sufficient [[capital (economics)|capital]] and manpower. These conditions are commonly assumed in economic analyses of [[profit (economics)]]

==Non-routine earnings==
The use of [[intellectual property]] generates non-routine profits. Those are often an order-of-magnitude greater than routine earnings.&lt;ref&gt;John Hand and Baruch Lev (editors): Intangible Assets, Values, Measures. and Risks; Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-routine profits are essential to warrant the high [[investment]]s needed for [[high-technology]] industries.

== Earnings manipulation ==
Some statistical models (e.g. based on [[Benford's law]] or [[Beneish M-Score]]) are used in order to detect possible earnings manipulations (fraud).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2730">'''Management ''f''-Laws''' are subversive epigrams about common management practices. Based on observation and experience, they are used to draw attention to entrenched ways of thinking about management and business that are often at odds with common sense or our actual experience. 

Systems theorist [[Russell L. Ackoff]], his co-author Herbert J. Addison and Sally Bibb invented the term in 2006 to describe their series of over 100 distilled observations of bad leadership and the misplaced wisdom that often surrounds management in organizations. Ackoff and Addison's ''f''-Laws might seem counter-intuitive. They are designed to challenge organizations' unquestioning adherence to established management habits or beliefs.  Many of the ''f''-Laws describe a relationship of inverse proportionality, in example: ''"The lower the rank of managers, the more they know about fewer things."''

The ''f''-Laws advocate adopting a positive, forward-looking and interactive approach to structural or systematic change within organizations, following the principles of [[idealized design]].  This is a process that "involves redesigning the organization on the assumption that it was destroyed last night... The most effective way of creating the future is by closing or reducing the gap between the current state and the idealized design".

Three collections of ''f''-Laws entitled [http://www.triarchypress.net/a-little-book-of-f-laws.html A Little Book of f-Laws: 13 Common Sins of Management], [http://www.triarchypress.net/management-f-laws.html Management f-Laws: How Organizations Really Work] and [http://www.triarchypress.net/systems-thinking-for-curious-managers.html Systems Thinking for Curious Managers] have been published. While, if read in isolation, each ''f''-Law is a witty and thought-provoking axiom, the books provide a context that draws upon [[systems thinking]] and the debate over the importance of developing [[soft skills]] in business environments.

{{Business administration}}
'''International business''' refers to the trade of [[Goods and services|goods, services,]] technology, capital and/or knowledge across [[national borders]] and at a global level. 

It involves cross-border [[Financial transaction|transactions]] of goods and services between two or more countries. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, and people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business is also known as [[globalization]].

To conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to bridge separate national [[Market (economics)|markets]] into one global marketplace. There are two macro-scale factors that underline the trend of greater globalization. The first consists of eliminating [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to make cross-border trade easier (e.g. free flow of goods and services, and capital, referred to as "[[free trade]]"). The second is technological change, particularly developments in communication, [[information processing]], and [[Freight transport|transportation]] technologies.

== Overview ==
"International business" is also defined as the study of the internationalization process of multinational enterprises. A [[multinational enterprise]] (MNE) is a company that has a worldwide approach to markets, production and/or operations in several countries. Well-known MNEs include fast-food companies such as: McDonald's (MCD), YUM (YUM), Starbucks Coffee Company (SBUX), Microsoft (MSFT), etc. Other industrial MNEs leaders include vehicle manufacturers such as: Ford Motor Company, and General Motors (GMC). Some consumer electronics producers such as Samsung, LG and Sony, and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, and British Petroleum (BP) are also multinational enterprises. 

Multinational enterprises range from any kind of business activity or market, from consumer goods to machinery manufacture; a company can become an international business. Therefore, to conduct business overseas, companies should be aware of all the factors that might affect any business activities, including, but not limited to: difference in legal systems, political systems, [[economic policy]], [[language barrier|language]], [[Accounting standard|accounting standards]], [[International labour law|labor standards]], living standards, [[environmental standard]]s, [[culture|local culture]]s, [[Organizational culture|corporate cultures]], [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange markets]], [[tariff]]s, [[import]] and [[export]] regulations, [[Trade agreement|trade agreements]], [[climate]], and [[education]]. Each of these factors may require changes in how companies operate from one country to another. Each factor makes a difference and a connection.

One of the first scholars to engage in developing a theory of multinational companies was Canadian economist [[Stephen Hymer]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckley P.J. (2010) Stephen Hymer: Three Phases, One Approach?. In: Foreign Direct Investment, China and the World Economy. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his academic life, he developed theories that sought to explain [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and why firms become multinational.

There were three phases of [[internationalization]] according to Hymer's work. The first phase of Hymer's work was his dissertation in 1960 called the ''[https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/27375 International Operations of National Firms]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hymer|first=Stephen H.|date=1960|others=Charles P. Kindleberger., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Economics|title=The international operations of national firms, a study of direct foreign investment|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/27375|journal=|language=en-US|volume=|pages=|via=DSpace@MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this thesis, the author departs from [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical theory]] and opens up a new area of international production. At first, Hymer started analyzing neoclassical theory and [[financial investment]], where the main reason for [[capital movement]] is the [[Interest rate parity|difference in interest rates]]. After this analysis, Hymer analyzed the characteristics of foreign investment by large companies for [[Production (economics)|production]] and direct business purposes, calling this Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). By analyzing the two types of investments, Hymer distinguished financial investment from direct investment. The main distinguishing feature was control. [[Portfolio investment]] is a more passive approach, and the main purpose is [[Profit (economics)|financial gain]], whereas in foreign direct investment a firm has control over the [[Operations management|operations]] abroad. So, the traditional theory of investment based on differential interest rates does not explain the motivations for FDI.

According to Hymer, there are two main determinants of FDI; where an [[imperfect market]] structure is the key element. The first is the [[Competitive advantage|firm-specific advantages]] which are developed at the specific companies home country and, profitably, used in the foreign country. The second determinant is the removal of control where Hymer wrote: "When firms are interconnected, they [[Competition (economics)|compete]] in selling in the same market or one of the firms may sell to the other," and because of this "it may be profitable to substitute centralized decision-making for [[decentralized decision-making]]".

Hymer's second phase is his neoclassical article in 1968 that includes a theory of internationalization and explains the direction of growth of the international expansion of firms. In a later stage, Hymer went to a more [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] approach where he explains that MNC as agents of an international capitalist system causing conflict and contradictions, causing among other things [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[poverty]] in the world. Hymer is the "father of the theory of MNEs", and explains the motivations for companies doing direct business abroad.

Among modern economic theories of multinationals and foreign direct investment are [[internalization theory]] and [[John Harry Dunning|John Dunning's]] [[Eclectic paradigm|OLI paradigm]] (standing for ''ownership, location and internationalization''). Dunning was widely known for his research in economics of international direct investment and the multinational enterprise. His OLI paradigm, in particular, remains as the predominant theoretical contribution to study international business topics. Hymer and Dunning are considered [[Founder (disambiguation)|founders]] of international business as a specialist [[field of study]].

==Physical and social factors of competitive business and social environment==
The conduct of international operations depends on a company's objectives and the means with which they carry them out. The operations affect and are affected by the physical and societal factors and the [[competitive]] [[social environment|environment]].

===Operations===
All firms that want to go international have one goal in common; the desire to increase their respective [[Economic value added|economic values]] when engaging in international trade transactions. To accomplish this goal, each firm must develop its individual strategy and approach to maximize [[Value (economics)|value]], lower costs, and increase profits.  A firm's value creation is the difference between {{Math|''V''}} (the value of the product being sold) and {{Math|''C''}} (the cost of production per each product sold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business:  Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=382|edition=10|url=https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/books/007811277X|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Value creation]] can be categorized as: ''primary activities'' ([[research and development]], production, marketing and sales, [[customer service]]) and as ''support activities'' (information systems, logistics, human resources).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business:  Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=383|edition=10|url=https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/books/007811277X|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these activities must be managed effectively and be consistent with the [[Corporate strategy|firm strategy]]. However, the success of firms that extend internationally depends on the goods or services sold and on the firm's core competencies (Skills within the firm that competitors cannot easily match or imitate). For a firm to be successful, the firm's strategy must be consistent with the environment in which the firm operates. Therefore, the firm needs to change its [[organizational structure]] to reflect changes in the setting in which they are operating and the strategy they are pursuing.

Once a firm decides to enter a foreign market, it must decide on a mode of entry. There are six different modes to enter a foreign market, and each mode has [[wiktionary:pros and cons|pros and cons]] that are associated with it. The firm must decide which mode is most appropriately aligned with the company's goals and objectives.  The six different modes of entry are exporting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp|title=Export|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-19|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[turnkey project]]s, [[License|licensing]], [[franchising]], establishing [[joint venture]]s with a host-country firm, or setting up a new [[wholly owned subsidiary]] in the host country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=453–454|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first entry mode is [[exporting]]. Exporting is the sale of a product in a different national market than a centralized hub of manufacturing. In this way, a firm may realize a substantial [[Economies of scale|scale of economies]] from its global sales revenue. As an example, many [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japanese automakers]] made inroads into the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. market]] through exporting.  There are two primary advantages to exporting:  avoiding high costs of establishing manufacturing in a host country (when these are higher) and gaining an [[Experience curve effects|experience curve]].  Some possible disadvantages to exporting are high transport costs and high [[Tariff|tariff barriers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=454|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second entry mode is a turnkey project. In a turnkey project, an independent contractor is hired by the company to oversee all of the preparation for entering a foreign market.  Once the preparation is complete and the end of the contract is reached, the plant is turned over to the company fully ready for operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=454–455|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensing and franchising are two additional entry modes that are similar in operation. Licensing allows a [[licensor]] to grant the rights to an intangible property to the licensee for a specified period of time for a royalty fee. Franchising, on the other hand, is a specialized form of licensing in which the "franchisor" sells the [[intangible property]] to the franchisee, and also requires the franchisee operate as dictated by the franchisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=456–457|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary are two more entry modes in international business. A ''joint venture'' is when a firm created is jointly owned by two or more companies (Most joint venture are 50-50 [[Partnership|partnerships]]). This is in contrast with a wholly owned subsidiary, when a firm owns 100 percent of the [[stock]] of a company in a foreign country because it has either set up a new operation or [[Corporate acquisition|acquires]] an established firm in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=457–458|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two macro factors underline the trend of greater globalization. The first is falling of barriers to make cross-border trade easier such as the free flow of goods and services, and capital. The second factor is technological change, particularly the developments in communication, information processing, and transportation technologies. Usually, [[private companies]] undertake transactions for profit; governments undertake such transactions for profit and for political reasons.|authors=Daniels, John; Radebaugh, Lee H.; Sullivan, Daniel P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of entry mode in international business===

Strategic variables affect the choice of entry mode for [[multinational corporation]] expansion beyond their [[Domestic market|domestic markets]]. These variables are global concentration, global synergies, and global strategic motivations of MNC.
* Global concentration: many MNEs share and overlap markets with a limited number of other corporations in the same [[industry]].
* Global synergies: the reuse or sharing of resources by a corporation and may include marketing departments or other inputs that can be used in multiple markets. This includes, among other things, [[Brand awareness|brand name recognition]].
* Global strategic motivations: other factors beyond entry mode that are the basic reasons for corporate expansion into an additional market. These are strategic reasons that may include establishing a foreign outpost for expansion, developing sourcing sites among other strategic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, W. C., &amp; Hwang, P. (1992). [http://www.monman.com/global-strategy-and-multinationals-entry-mode-choice Global strategy and multinationals' entry mode choice]. Journal of International Business Studies, 23(1), 29. Accessed 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Means of businesses===
* Entry modes: Export/import, wholly owned subsidiary, merger or acquisition, alliances and joint ventures, licensing&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, F., Doh, J. P. (2015).  International Management: Culture, Strategy and Behavior, 9th edition. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|0-07786244-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modes: [[import]]ing and [[exporting]], [[tourism]] and [[transportation]], [[licensing]] and [[franchising]], [[turnkey]] operations, [[management]] [[contracts]], [[direct investment]] and [[portfolio investments]].
* Functions: [[marketing]], global [[manufacturing]] and [[supply chain management]], [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[human resources]]
* Overlaying alternatives: choice of countries, organization and [[control mechanisms]]

===Physical and social factors===
* Geographical influences: There are many different geographic factors that affect international business. These factors are: the geographical size, the [[Climate change|climatic challenges]] happening throughout the world, the [[Natural resource|natural resources]] available on a specific territory, the [[Population density|population distribution]] in a country, etc.&lt;ref name=witiger&gt;
Witiger, (2012). [https://web.archive.org/web/20051110172534/http://www.witiger.com/internationalbusiness/physicalgeographicenvironment.htm The Physical/Geographic Environment]. Accessed 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social factors: Political policies: political disputes, particularly those that result in the military confrontation, can [[Economics of war|disrupt]] trade and investment.
* Legal policies: domestic and international laws play a big role in determining how a company can operate overseas.
* Behavioral factors: in a foreign environment, the related disciplines such as anthropology, psychology, and sociology are helpful for managers to get a better understanding of values, attitudes, and beliefs.
*[[Economic forces]]: economics explains country differences in costs, currency values, and market size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Risks:===
* '''Faulty Planning'''

To achieve success in penetrating a foreign market and remaining profitable, efforts must be directed towards the planning and execution of Phase I. The use of conventional [[SWOT analysis]], [[market research]], and cultural research, will give a firm appropriate tools to reduce risk of failure abroad. Risks that arise from poor planning include: large expenses in marketing, administration and product development (with no sales); disadvantages derived from local or federal laws of a foreign country, lack of popularity because of a [[Market saturation|saturated market]], vandalism of physical property due to instability of country; etc. There are also cultural risks when entering a foreign market. Lack of research and understanding of local customs can lead to alienation of locals and brand dissociation.&lt;ref name="okolo2"&gt;Okolo, S. (n.d.). Global Business: Risks in International Business. [online] Globalpaarisite.blogspot.com.es. Available at: http://globalpaarisite.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/risks-in-international-business.html [Accessed 10 May 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic risks can be defined as the uncertainties and untapped opportunities embedded in your strategic intent and how well they are executed. As such, they are key matters for the board and impinge on the whole business, rather than just an isolated unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/advisory/consulting.html|title=Consulting|first=|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|date=|website=PwC|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Operational risk'''
A company has to be conscious about the production costs to not waste time and money. If the expenditures and costs are controlled, it will create an efficient production and help the internationalization.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Operational risk is the prospect of loss resulting from inadequate or failed procedures, systems or policies; employee errors, systems failure, fraud or other criminal activity, or any event that disrupts business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/operational-risk|title=What is operational risk? - Definition from WhatIs.com|author=|date=|website=techtarget.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Political risk''' 

How a government governs a country ([[governance]]) can affect the operations of a firm. The government might be [[Corruption|corrupt]], hostile, or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]; and may have a negative image around the globe. A firm's reputation can change if it operates in a country controlled by that type of government.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Also, an unstable political situation can be a risk for multinational firms. [[Elections]] or any unexpected political event can change a country's situation and put a firm in an awkward position.&lt;ref name=heinsz&gt;J. Henisz, W. and A. Zelner, B. (2010). [https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-hidden-risks-in-emerging-markets|The Hidden Risks in Emerging Markets]. Harvard Business Review. Accessed 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Political risks are the likelihood that political forces will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. Political risk tends to be greater in countries experiencing [[social unrest]]. When political risk is high, there is a high probability that a change will occur in the country's political environment that will endanger foreign firms there. Corrupt foreign governments may also [[Expropriation|take over the company without warning]], as seen in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Charles H.L Hill"&gt;Charles H.L Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Technological risk'''

Technological improvements bring many benefits, but some disadvantages as well. Some of these risks include "lack of [[Information security|security in electronic transactions]], the [[Non-recurring engineering|cost of developing new technology]] ... the fact that this new technology may fail, and, when all of these are coupled with the outdated existing technology, [the fact that] the result may create a dangerous effect in doing business in the international arena."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt;
* '''Environmental risk''' 

Companies that establish a subsidiary or factory abroad need to be conscious about the externalizations they will produce, as some may have negative effects such as [[Noise pollution|noise]] or [[pollution]].  This may cause aggravation to the people living there, which in turn can lead to a conflict. People want to live in a clean and quiet environment, without pollution or unnecessary noise. If a conflict arises, this may lead to a negative change in customer's perception of the company. Actual or potential threat of adverse effects on living organisms and environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, resource depletion, etc., arising out of an organization's activities is considered to be risks of the environment. As new business leaders come to fruition in their careers, it will be increasingly important to curb business activities and externalizations that may hurt the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/environmental-risk.html|title=What is environmental risk? definition and meaning|author=|date=|website=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Economic risk''' 
These are the economic risks explained by Professor Okolo: "This comes from the inability of a country to meet its financial obligations. The changing of foreign-investment or/and domestic fiscal or monetary policies. The effect of exchange-rate and interest rate make it difficult to conduct international business."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Moreover, it can be a risk for a company to operate in a country and they may experience an unexpected economic crisis after establishing the subsidiary.&lt;ref name=heinsz /&gt; Economic risks is the likelihood that economic management will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. In practice, the biggest problem arising from economic mismanagement has been inflation. Historically many governments have expanded their domestic money supplying misguided attempts to stimulate economic activity.&lt;ref name="Charles H.L Hill"/&gt;
* '''Financial risk'''

According to Professor Okolo: "This area is affected by the currency exchange rate, government flexibility in allowing the firms to [[Repatriation|repatriate]] profits or funds outside the country. The [[devaluation]] and inflation will also affect the firm's ability to operate at an efficient capacity and still be stable."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Tax|taxes]] that a company has to pay might be advantageous or not. It might be higher or lower in the host countries. Then "the risk that a government will indiscriminately change the laws, regulations, or contracts governing an investment—or will fail to [[Enforcement|enforce]] them—in a way that reduces an investor's [[Financial return|financial returns]] is what we call 'policy risk.'"&lt;ref name=heinsz /&gt;
* '''Terrorism'''

[[Terrorism]] is a voluntary act of violence towards a group(s) of people. In most cases, acts of terrorism is derived from hatred of religious, political and cultural beliefs. An example was the infamous [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], labeled as terrorism due to the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|massive damages]] inflicted on [[Society of the United States|American society]] and the global economy stemming from the animosity towards [[Western culture]] by some [[Radical Islam|radical Islamic groups]]. Terrorism not only affects civilians, but it also damages corporations and other businesses. These effects may include: physical [[vandalism]] or [[destruction of property]], sales declining due to frightened consumers and governments issuing public safety restrictions. Firms engaging in international business will find it difficult to operate in a country that has an uncertain assurance of safety from these attacks.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt;
* '''Bribery'''

[[Bribery]] is the act of receiving or soliciting of any items or services of value to influence the actions of a party with public or legal obligations. This is considered to an unethical form of practicing business and can have legal repercussions. Firm that want to operate legally should instruct employees to not involve themselves or the company in such activities. Companies should avoid doing business in countries where unstable forms of government exist as it could bring unfair advantages against domestic business and/or harm the social fabric of the citizens.

==Factors towards globalization==
There has been growth in [[globalization]] in recent decades due to the following factors.

{{List incomplete|date=November 2018}}

*[[Technology]] is expanding, especially in [[transportation]] and [[communications]].
*[[Governments]] are removing international business restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Institutions]] provide services to ease the conduct of international business.
*[[Consumer]]s want to know about [[Foreign trade|foreign]] [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Competition]] has become more global.
*[[Political]] relationships have improved among some major [[economic]] powers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Countries]] cooperate more on transnational issues.
*[[Cross-national cooperation and agreements]] have increased.

==Importance of international business education==
* Most companies are either [[international]] companies or [[Competition (economics)|compete]] with other international companies.
* Modes of [[Business operations|operation]] may differ from those used domestically.
* The best way of conducting business may differ by [[country]].
* An understanding helps one make better [[career]] decisions.
* An understanding helps one decide what [[Government policy|governmental policies]] to support.

Managers in international business must understand [[social science]] disciplines and how they affect different functional business fields.

To maintain and achieve successful business operations in foreign nations, persons must understand how variations in culture and traditions across nations affect business practices. This idea is known as [[cultural literacy]]. Without knowledge of a host country's culture, corporate strategizing is more difficult and error-prone when entering foreign markets compared with the home country's market and culture. This can create a "blind spot" during the decision making process and result in [[ethnocentrism]]. Education about international business introduces the student to new concepts that can be applicable in international strategy in topics such as marketing and operations.

===Importance of language and cultural studies===

A considerable advantage in international business is gained through the knowledge and use of language, thereby mitigating a [[language barrier]]. Advantages of being an international businessperson who is [[Fluency|fluent]] in the [[local language]] include the following:
*Having the ability to directly communicate with employees and customers
*Understanding the manner of speaking within business in the local area to improve overall [[productivity]]
*Gaining respect of customers and employees from speaking with them in their native tongue

In many cases, it plays a crucial role. It is truly impossible to gain an understanding of a culture's buying habits without first taking the time to understand the culture.  Examples of the benefit of understanding local culture include the following:
*Being able to provide marketing techniques that are specifically tailored to the local market
*Knowing how other businesses operate and what might or might not be social taboos 
*Understanding the time structure of an area.  Some societies are more focused on timeliness ("[[Punctuality|being on time]]") while others focus on doing business at "[[Business hours|the right time]]".
*Associating with people who do not know several languages.
*Language barriers can affect transaction costs. ''[[Linguistic distance]]'' is defined as the amount of variation one language has from another. For example, French, and Spanish are both languages derived from Latin. When evaluating dialogue in these languages, you will discover many similarities. However, languages such as English and Chinese or English and Arabic vary much more strongly and contain far fewer similarities. The [[Writing system|writing systems]] of these languages are also different. The larger the linguistic distance there, the wider language barriers to cross. These differences can reflect on transaction costs and make foreign business operations more expensive.

===Importance of studying international business===

The international business standards focus on the following:
*raising awareness of the inter-relatedness of one country's political policies and economic practices on another;
*learning to improve international business relations through appropriate communication strategies;
*understanding the global business environment—that is, the interconnections of cultural, political, legal, economic, and ethical systems;
*exploring basic concepts underlying [[international finance]], [[management]], [[marketing]], and trade relations; and
*identifying forms of business [[ownership]] and international business opportunities.
By focusing on these, students will gain a better understanding of [[Political economy]]. These are tools that would help future business people bridge the economic and political gap between countries.

There is an increasing amount of demand for business people with an education in international business. A survey conducted by Thomas Patrick from [[University of Notre Dame]] concluded that [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] holders felt that the training received through education were very practical in the working environment. Increasingly, companies are sourcing their human resource requirement globally. For example, at [[Sony|Sony Corporation]], only fifty percent of its employees are Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS|last=|first=ASWATHAPPA|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259051166|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business people with an education in international business also had a significantly higher chance of being sent abroad to work under the international operations of a firm.

'''Managerialism''', on one level, involves [[belief]] in the value of [[professional]] [[manager]]s and of the concepts and methods they use.  Contemporary writers on [[management]] such as Thomas Diefenbach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.amazon.com/Hierarchy-Organisation-Hierarchical-Management-Organizations/dp/0415843928 |title= Hierarchy and Organisation: Toward a General Theory of Hierarchical Social Systems |last= Diefenbach |first= Thomas |date= 2013-06-21 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 9780415843928 |language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt; associate managerialism with [[hierarchy]]. But scholars have also linked managerialism to [[control (management) | control]],&lt;ref&gt;

Whether the organization behaves in an organic way is, to an important extent, a result of the management's efforts, and the direction of that organic force is something over which management attempts to exercise control. Thus, managerialism has not accepted the underlying determinism of capitalism and socialism.

 | quote = Accountability as managerialism [...] Hood and Lodge (2006: 186-187; Hood and Scott 2000) argue that NPM and managerialism have changed the nature of the public service bargain. [...] Thus, to demonstrate results, managerial accountability is employed with a combination of market accountability with more 'customer' focus to users of public services, and performance management regimes. The idea is to ensure that bureaucrats are more responsive to users of services (downward accountability) and report results and policy delivery to political masters (upward accountability). Ironically[,] managerial regimes have had unintended outcomes with civil servants becoming defensive about performance rather than being innovative - the exact opposite of what managerial regimes are designed to achieve (ibid).

American management experts Robert Locke and J C Spender see managerialism as an expression of a special group – management – that entrenches itself ruthlessly and systemically in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.amazon.com/Confronting-Managerialism-Business-Economic-Controversies/dp/178032071X|title= Confronting Managerialism: How the Business Elite and Their Schools Threw Our Lives Out of Balance|last= Locke|first= Robert R.|last2= Spender|first2= J.-C.|date= 2011-09-08|publisher= Zed Books|isbn= 9781780320717|edition= 2011|language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It deprives owners of decision-making power and workers of their ability to resist managerialism. In fact the rise of managerialism may in itself be a response to people's resistance in society and more specifically to workers' opposition against managerial regimes.

Building on Enteman (1993) and Locke/Spender (2011), Thomas Klikauer in “Managerialism – Critique of an Ideology” (2013) defined managerialism thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.amazon.com/Managerialism-Critique-Ideology-T-Klikauer/dp/1137334266/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471326015&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Managerialism+%25E2%2580%2593+Critique+of+an+Ideology%25E2%2580%259D|title= Managerialism: A Critique of an Ideology|last= Klikauer|first= T.|date= 2013-09-12|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|isbn= 9781137334268|edition= 2013|language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://mlq.sagepub.com/content/42/3/355|title= Book review: Critical Management Ethics Thomas Klikauer.

[http://sydney.edu.au/arts/economics/staff/profiles/tony.aspromourgos.php] In both cases, managerialism occurs when public institutions are run “as if” these were for-profit organization even though they remain government institutions funded through state taxes. In these cases, the term new public management has been used. [https://www.routledge.com/The-Ashgate-Research-Companion-to-New-Public-Management/Christensen-Laegreid/p/book/9780754678069] But the ideology of managerialism can even extend into more distant institutions such as, for example, a College of Physicians.[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:2Mgeg558U3MJ:https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2015/202/10/scourge-managerialism-and-royal-australasian-college-physicians+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;client=firefox-b]

Compare what the historian James Hoopes wrote (2003):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[...] the main genesis of managerialism lay in the [[human relations movement]] that took root at the [[Harvard Business School]] in the 1920s and 1930s under the guiding hand of Professor [[Elton Mayo]]. Mayo, an immigrant from Australia, saw democracy as divisive and lacking in community spirit. He looked to corporate managers to restore the social harmony that he believed the uprooting experiences of immigration and industrialization had destroyed and that democracy was incapable of repairing."&lt;ref&gt;

== Managerialist ideology ==
The managerialist society is not one which responds to the needs, desires, and wishes of a majority of its citizens, but one which is influenced by organizations. The managerialist society responds to the managements of various organizations in relation to their transactions with each other. The needs, desires and wishes of the individual are heard through their membership of an organization. Furthermore, managerialism is both a process and a substantive ideology. Managerialism says that the fundamental social units are not individuals, as [[capitalism]] would declare, but rather that the fundamental social units are organizations. Ultimately, managerialism specifically denies that the fundamental nature of society is an aggregation of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}}

Instead, managerialism sees the core building-block of contemporary society as the modern [[business sector|business]] company or corporation. To further [[commerce|business]], companies, and corporations is the ideological goal of managerialism. How managerialism functions as such an ideology has been perfectly expressed by one of managerialism's main ideological flagships – the ''Harvard Business Review'' - when the ''HBR'''s former editor Joan Magretta (2012: 80-81) made the following stunning revelation:[[# edn1|[i]]]&lt;blockquote&gt; Business executives are society's leading champions of free markets and competition, words that, for them, evoke a world view and value system that rewards good ideas and hard work, and that fosters innovation and meritocracy. Truth be told, the competition every manager longs for is a lot closer to Microsoft's end of the spectrum than it is to the dairy farmers'. All the talk about the virtues of competition notwithstanding, the aim of business strategy is to move an enterprise away from perfect competition and in the direction of monopoly.
----[[# ednref1|[i]]]            Magretta, J. 2012. ''What Management Is: How it works and why it's everyone's business'', London: Profile.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Political ===
Managerialism in [[political science]] is a set of beliefs, attitudes and values which support the view that management is the most essential and desirable element of good administration and government. It follows that in all enterprises and services, both private and public, expertise in management must be taught by training and by incentives to excel. In the political world this may take the form of asserting that much conflict and argument are unnecessary for solving problems. All that is needed is a rational assessment of the problem and this involves gathering and collating information, listing the options, calculating costs of each, evaluating consequences and choosing the best course of action. Recent managerialism has included such devices as "[[performance indicator]]s" (purporting to measure the relative efficiencies of different managers) and "[[market testing]]" (which compares public sector managers' responsibilities and tasks with those of managers in the private sector in order to assess their pay). Managerialism is criticized for weakening the [[public service|public-service]] ethos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one were to conceive of society as a nation, such as the United States, managerialism concludes that there is no single United States and that individual Americans should not be identified as the fundamental nature of the country. Rather, the country is basically composed of numerous groups which collectively make up the country we call the United States. 
The government is a part of the managerial process. The management of different groups will attempt to influence the direction of government action. Their success or failure will depend upon their ability to pursue their case and upon their ability to blunt the cases of competitors. The success of the subunits depends upon the ability of their managements and other factors such as size, cohesiveness, managerial discretion, and control of resources. Government itself is a collection of governmental units. The government is not state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Bealey|first= Frank|title= The Blackwell dictionary of political science|year= 1999|publisher= Blackwell Publishers|location= Oxford, UK|isbn= 9780631206958|edition= 1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic ===
Economically, managerialism is the application of [http://smallbusiness.chron.com/management-techniques-2589.html managerial techniques] in businesses. Managerialism in this regard has to do with the strategic approach of [[goal-setting]]. In order to achieve previously unimagined levels of accumulation and production, businesses within a capitalist economy needed a way of connecting their strategic plan of actions to desired implementations of those plans. Within an organization, the individuals at the top of the organizational hierarchy determine a mission or set of goals, which is then strategically analyzed by individuals lower on the hierarchy (managers) to devise local goals to carry out the overall mission. Put simply, the managerial standard is to receive goals from above and to create new goals for those below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Preston|first= David Seth|title= The Rise of Managerialism|url= http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/doku.php?id=the_rise_of_managerialism|work= Encyclopaedia of Philosophy of Education|accessdate= 5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a belief that in managerialism, organizations have more similarities than differences, and thus the performance of all organizations can be optimized by the application of generic management skills and theory. To a practitioner of managerialism, there is little difference in the skills required to run a college, an advertising agency or an oil rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Quiggin |first= John |title= Word for Wednesday: managerialism (definition) |publisher= johnquiggin.com |date= 2003-07-02 |url= http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2003/07/02/word-for-wednesday-managerialism-definition/ |accessdate= 2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience and skills pertinent to an organization's core business are considered secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Methodology of Business Studies|last= Emmanuel|first= Mathew|publisher= Dorling Kindersley|year= 2010|isbn= 978-81-3173069-0|location= India|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "managerialism" can be used disparagingly to describe organizations perceived to have a preponderance or excess of managerial techniques, solutions, rules and personnel, especially if these seem to run counter to the common sense of observers. It is said{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that the MBA degree is intended to provide generic skills to a new class of managers not wedded to a particular industry or professional sector.&lt;ref&gt;"Managerialism Explained." ''Managerialism Explained''. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been mixed reviews on the efficacy of managerialism, explored extensively in university studies of the State. Some have accepted the flaws in the theory, building upon it and putting it forth as a valid theory of the State. Others have outright rejected such a proposition, responding that - regardless of the few similarities - such a system could not be successful on a political level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The word "managerialism" can also be used pejoratively, as in the definition of a management caste. Robert R. Locke defines it accordingly as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"What occurs when a special group, called management, ensconces itself systemically in an organization and deprives owners and employees of their decision-making power (including the distribution of emolument), and justifies that takeover on the grounds of the managing group's education and exclusive possession of the codified bodies of knowledge and know-how necessary to the efficient running of the organization."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== New Managerialism ==
Managerialism  – also called New Managerialism and New Public Management – is an [[ideology]] used for legitimizing the development of new organizational forms and relationships. It has been coined a practical ideology of being 'business-like’ in order to make the new arrangements work for all forms of jobs, organizations, and education systems. The ‘business-like’ indicates what is called “as if” ideologies. Managerialism is conceptualized in that it seeks firstly to explain the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and political reasons behind why particular organizations  have been developed and, secondly, to describe the ways in which public services are currently being delivered. The idea of Managerialism came to fruition when  new organizational forms originated from a view that professional [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] modes of organization were inefficient and could not cope with the challenges rising from increasing globalization. Managerialism, however, has not remained static over the years as it has had many different versions of its implementation. Its linkage to the changing practices associated with an agenda moves away from a purely [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal]] framework. While neo-liberalism uses politics (e.g. elections) to achieve its goals, Managerialism is fundamentally anti-democratic following instead management’s [[Henri Fayol|command-and-control]] concept. While using business-like mechanisms to ensure great cost effectiveness is still used as a great technique. There have been movements away from purely market based systems that were in place strictly for efficiency, to contractual mechanisms and performance measurement through audit and review. In practice of Managerialism, consumers are redefined as well. Not only do consumers have choice in regard to where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well.&lt;ref&gt;Nickson, Alicen. 2014. "A Qualitative Case Study Exploring the Nature of New Managerialism in UK Higher Education and Its Impact on Individual Academics' Experience of Doing Research." Journal of Research Administration 45, no. 1: 47-80. Business Source Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 8, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In new Managerialism consumers are redefined as well. Not only should they have choice regarding where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well. The Managerialism explains public services not as production functions or firms, but as governance structures. What is at stake is not so much the ethos and practice of management as the culture and structure of governance. Here governance means the organisational culture and structure of the relationship between what [[Max Weber|Weber]] called legitimate domination and the self-constitution of those who are subject to it. What Weber meant by legitimate domination was justified by an authority structure, which was, in turn, legitimated by rational authority. Hence, one finds a renewed interest of Managerialism in fostering managerial leadership. But governance through Managerialism was never only dependent for its legitimization on Weber’s notion of [[legal-rational authority]], but more on forms of rationality that depend upon, for example, strategic management, cost-benefit-analysis, efficiency in the market, etc. Although this Managerialism draws on models of corporate Managerialism as well as accounts of New Public Management, it is also imbued with the practices of self in everyday life. What is new here, is recognition of the technologies of self that individuals employ to implicate themselves in their own governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=managerialism_and_education|title=Managerialism and Education|last=Fitzsimons|first=Patrick|date=01/07/1999|website=EEPAT|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates what became known as “The Entrepreneurial Self”. The way Managerialism achieves this, for example, at university levels is through a re-formulation of research and science, as outlined in the table below.

=== Influences ===
 '''George Elton Mayo''' 
''"One friend, one person who is truly understanding, who takes the trouble to listen to us as we consider our problems, can change our whole outlook on the work"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quotehd.com/quotes/elton-mayo-quote-one-friend-one-person-who-is-truly-understanding-who-takes-the-trouble-to|title=Elton Mayo Quotes|last=Mayo|first=Elton|date=|website=QuoteHD|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elton Mayo|George Elton Mayo]] was an Australian psychologist and organizational theorist. A former professor of [[Industrial Management]] at the Harvard Business School, Mayo heavily researched the behavior of workers at Western Electric; a manufacturing facet of AT&amp;T. Today he is considered a major contributor to the intellectual thought process and ideas of business management, as well as critical theories of industrial and organizational psychology.  His book, ''The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization''  articulates his collective thoughts taken from the famous Hawthorne research study conducted while at Harvard University.

 '''Karl Marx'''

''"Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand."''&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, and David McLellan. ''The Grundrisse''. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] has set many standards in the fields of philosophy, economics, and sociology as one of the worlds most prominent thinkers. Commonly known for his ideas outlined in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' and ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]'' Marx has exemplified ideas of management and order with his very apparent [[Socialism|socialistic views]].  Sociologically Marx has identified core interrelations between groups of people classified by class structures, and how those relations lead to the success or failures of a collective society.

 '''Friedrich Nietzsche''' 
''"To do great things is difficult; but to command great things is more difficult"''&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, and Walter Arnold. Kaufmann. ''The Portable Nietzsche''. New York: Penguin, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th century German philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] heavily contributed to the fields of management and leadership.  Focussing in on ideas of morality; particularly distinguishing the differences between what he labeled the, "master morality," and "slave morality," Nietzsche has exemplified the development of managerial practices through the subjections of moral emphasis and control. "He was especially interested, therefore, in a probing analysis and evaluation of the fundamental cultural values of Western philosophy, religion, and morality, which he characterized as expressions of the ascetic ideal."http://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Nietzsche

== History ==  
The history of Managerialism is linked to the teachings of [[Karl Marx]]. In his collection of books over capitalism appropriately named [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]] he writes about how when capitalist merge with other capitalist and two corporations come together, they are more likely to become diluted and when that happens those who were once wise business leaders were to be just aimless managers he stated his belief in his books (only volume 1 was published while he was alive) as follows, "Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere manager, an administrator of other people's capital, and of the owners of capital into mere owners, mere money-capitalists.".&lt;ref&gt;Jessop, Bob, and Russell Wheatley. ''Karl Marx's Social and Political Thought''. London: Routledge, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx is talking about what would later be known as Managerialism which is first used by [[James Burnham]] who in his book ''The Managerial Revolution'' expresses his ideas on the difference between Capitalism and Managerialism stating that when the owners of capital are no longer the ones in charge, and managers, relying on only principle are in charge then it is no longer [[Capitalism]], it is now considered Managerialism.  Burnham's ideas, in both that book and a subsequent book ''The Machiavellians'' and also in articles which were published in Partisan Review, and elsewhere are thoroughly criticised by [[George Orwell]] in his 1946 essay ''Second Thoughts on James Burnham'' (first published in ''Polemic'' (London).

The '''metrics reference model (MRM)''' is the reference model created by the Consortium for Advanced Management-International (CAM-I) to be a single reference library of performance metrics.  This library is useful for accelerating to development of and improving the content of any organization's business intelligence solution.

==Background==
The MRM was created by the Business Intelligence Working Group of CAM-I.  Substantial secondary research performed by the group revealed that there was no single, central location for performance metrics information.  All published material focused on a single dimension of performance metrics (e.g., financial), or focused on how to use such metrics to affect the performance of an organization.  Exhaustive lists of performance metrics that were generic to nearly any organization across all aspects of the business (e.g., customer, product/service, employee) were not found.  Furthermore, without a single reference point, no research was located where the relationships between these performance metrics had been documented and described.

==Overview==
MRM is a technology agnostic reference model based on the basic elements of a generic organization for which cost, process, and performance improvements may be desired.

In keeping with CAM-I's generic model of an organization, these elements include:
*  Customers (or business sustaining forces)
*  Products and services
*  Processes and activities
*  Employees
*  Finance
*  Research and development
*  Infrastructure
*  Resources
*  Suppliers

The figure below illustrates the flow between these components in a typical organization. &lt;gallery&gt;Image:Organization_Elements.JPG|CAM-I's Generic Model of an Organization&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Content==
For each of the organizational elements, the MRM provides a comprehensive list of cost, process, and performance metrics of possible interest to many organizations.  For example, some of the performance metrics provided for the employee organizational element include average customer review, customer retention rate, sales per customer/spending rate, average quantity per customer order, order frequency, average number of orders per customer, and average customer lifetime value.

For each performance metric, this information is also provided:
*  '''Type.''' Provides further levels of suborganization within the organizational element where sensible (e.g., Financial).
*  '''Definition/Calculation.''' A generally accepted means of calculating the metric from measures is provided.
*  '''Strengths/Opportunities.''' Known advantages for using the metric.
*  '''Weaknesses/Problems/Risks.''' Known disadvantages for using the metric.
*  '''Target Setting.''' A discussion of the desired outcome.
*  '''Possible correlations/market basket of metrics.''' Consideration of other metrics and correlations of environmental factors are provided.  This area explores the relationship of the measure against every other metric in the MRM, an indication of the strength of the relationship (e.g., weak, moderate, strong), and an indication to the type of relationship (e.g., negatively correlated, positively correlated).

==Value and use of the MRM==
The benefit of the MRM is that each metric has already been identified, defined, and considered by a group of experienced business intelligence professionals. The idea of the MRM is for the business intelligence (BI) practitioner to follow these steps:
*  Assess the requirements of the BI solution and determine which organization components apply.
*  For each organizational component that applies, open this document to the associated MRM section.
*  Review each of the measures.
*  Identify measures of interest.
*  Review the information provided about each measure and either accept or reject the measure for inclusion in the BI tool.
*  Accumulate all desired measures in a list.
*  Use the measures (or, if metrics are selected, use the measures in the Definition/Calculation column) to drive the BI data model.

===Using the MRM in industry===
How the MRM may be used practically in the industry depends on whether an individual or an organization is considered.

Individual interest in the MRM:
*  Program analysts: Use the MRM to tailor to a specific program/organization.
*  Managers: Use the MRM model to validate that the metrics selected represent the needs of their business.
*  Strategic planners: Use the MRM to determine metric relationships and correlations in order to determine strategic decisions.
*  Operational planners: Use the MRM to understand operational data points that you have control over to affect the metrics and understand the components of the metrics.
*  BI practitioners: Use the MRM to define the BI requirements and calculations, as well as the interpretation of the data.  Help the business owner determine the appropriate display of metrics.
*  Vendors:  Use the MRM to provide relevant products/services that answer clients’ needs out-of-the-box.
*  Educators:  Use the MRM to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the various measures.

====Organizational interest in the MRM====
*  New organizations/agencies, mergers &amp; acquisitions
*  Existing organizations that are starting performance measurement efforts
*  Consulting organizations for use in client situations
*  Software vendors
*  Monitoring organizations
*  Those with performance challenges (may have metrics, but not enough to interpret that metric)
*  Those who do not wish to go through a large strategic planning exercise but want to start using best practice metrics for common functions
*  Small budgets or time constraints or those that do not have the expertise to create metrics

====Use Cases====
The MRM to be used in a number of different ways, including:

*  Use as part of planning process.  Rather than starting from a blank slate, go through each and add those that are specific to their organization.  *  Use to generate ideas.  Customize existing, add specific to your organization
*  Use as a cookbook.  Select ingredients (metrics) of interest from each area when there are known objectives but want to save time.
*  Use to refine existing program (rare), compare metrics vs. existing (completeness review)
*  BI practitioner:  Use for developing the calculations, finding the data needed to run the calculations, and building appropriate data structures
*  For consulting organizations to provide more thorough results quickly (competitive advantage)
*  For software vendors to provide specific applications
*  Education tool (understanding strengths/weaknesses of metrics, etc.) for staff at all levels to understand what’s important

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4813">'''Mobile file management''' (MFM) is a type of [[information technology]] (IT) software that allows businesses to manage transfers and storage of corporate files and other related items on a [[mobile device]], and allows the business to oversee user access.  Mobile file management software is typically installed on a corporate [[file server]] like [[Windows 2008]], and on a [[mobile device]] such as  [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s, e.g., [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], etc.  Other features include the ability to remotely wipe a lost or stolen device, access, cache and store files on a mobile device and integrate with [[filesystem permissions|file permission solutions]] like those from [[Microsoft]]'s [[Active Directory]].&lt;ref name=GroupLogic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grouplogic.com/enterprise-file-sharing/ipad-file-system/ |title=iPad File System: Mobile File Management |work=GroupLogic |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809091958/http://www.grouplogic.com/enterprise-file-sharing/ipad-file-system/# |archive-date=2011-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/052311-grouplogic-mobilecho.html |title=Apple iPad Corporate Security Gets Boost from GroupLogic |author=Greene, Tim |date=23 May 2011 |work=Network World |publisher=International Data Group (IDG) |access-date=2011-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613142923/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/052311-grouplogic-mobilecho.html# |archive-date=2011-06-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main advantage of modern mobile file management solutions is that they do not need a VPN connection for the mobile devices to connect to the corporate file servers. The connection between the mobile device and the corporate file server is established via a cloud service. This way the corporate [[file server]] doesn't need to open incoming ports which would cause security issues. The files are transferred highly encrypted{{snd}} e.g. according to AES 256-bit industry standard. Only the company server and the mobile device keep the encryption key to be able to encrypt and decrypt the files. So nobody, not even the mobile file management solution provider, can access the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep your documents under your control|url=http://www.file-spirit.com/#FileSpirit_keep_your_documents_under_your_control|work=FileSpirit Website|publisher=espírito GmbH|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party cloud-based companies provide solutions which can be used to manage mobile files but are not controlled by corporate IT organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://community.citrix.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=174000119# |title="Follow-Me Data" Means Secure Seamless Access to Work Wherever and Whenever You Need It! » ocb - Citrix Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2011-05-27 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131129025945/http://community.citrix.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=174000119# |archive-date=2013-11-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobiledevicemanagement.org/mobile-device-management-overview Mobile Device Management Overview | Mobile Device Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.filehold.com/products/mobile-filehold Mobile Document Management Software&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that utilize [[Mobile Device Management]] solutions can also secure content on mobile devices, but usually cannot provide [[Direct access (computing)|direct access]] and connection to a corporate file server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devicemanagement.org/content/view/20754/152/ Device Management Forum - Mobile Device Management - Brave New Horizon or Basic Plumbing?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120801091503/http://www.devicemanagement.org/content/view/20754/152/ |date=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''negotiable instrument''' is a document guaranteeing the payment of a specific amount of money, either on demand, or at a set time, with the payer usually named on the document. More specifically, it is a document contemplated by or consisting of a [[contract]], which promises the payment of money without condition, which may be paid either on demand or at a future date. The term can have different meanings, depending on what law is being applied and what country and context it is used in.

==Definition==
In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] almost all jurisdictions have codified the law relating to negotiable instruments in a Bills of Exchange Act, e.g. [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]] in the UK, [[Bills of Exchange Act 1908]] in New Zealand, Bills of Exchange Act 1909 in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|boea1909148|Bills of Exchange Act 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881]] in India and the Bills of Exchange Act 1914 in Mauritius. The Bills of Exchange Act:
# defines a bill of exchange as:  'an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person, or to bearer.
# defines a cheque as: 'a bill of exchange drawn on (behalf of) a banker, which is payable on demand (by banker)'
# defines a promissory note as: 'an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person or to bearer.'

Additionally most Commonwealth jurisdictions have separate Cheques Acts providing for additional protections for bankers collecting unendorsed or irregularly endorsed cheques, providing that cheques that are crossed and marked 'not negotiable' or similar are not transferable, and providing for electronic presentation of cheques in inter-bank cheque clearing systems.

== History ==
The ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as ''praescriptiones'' in the 1st century BCE&lt;ref name="Durant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=    Caesar and Christ : a history of Roman civilization and of Christianity from their beginnings to A.D. 325|series=The story of civilization|volume=3|year=1944|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|page=749}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,000-year-old Roman [[promissory note]]s have been found&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/ancient-rome-London-Londinum-Bloomberg-archaeology-Boudicca-archaeology/|title=Ancient Roman IOUs Found Beneath Bloomberg's New London HQ|date=2016-06-01|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3620788/The-City-s-IOU-2-000-year-old-letters-reveal-daily-life-trade-debts-Roman-London.html|title=Ancient letters reveal daily life, trade and debts in Roman London|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common prototypes of bills of exchanges and promissory notes originated in [[China]], where special instruments called ''feitsyan'' were used to safely transfer money over long distances during the reign of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UBDndXgNIYC&amp;pg=PA50 |last=Moshenskyi  |first=Sergii |title= History of the Weksel |publisher= Xlibris Corporation |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-4363-0693-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Around 1150 the [[History of the Knights Templar#Bankers|Knights Templar]] issued bank notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1877-5888_rpp_com_125078|title=Templar Order|website=Religion Past and Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57175151|title=The Knights Templar : the history and myths of the legendary military order|last=1966-|first=Martin, Sean,|date=2004|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1560256451|edition= 1st Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|oclc=57175151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-13th century, the [[Ilkhanid]] rulers of [[Persia]] printed the "cha" or "chap" which was used as paper money for limited usage for transactions between the court and the merchants for about three years before it collapsed. The collapse was caused by the court accepting the "cha" only at progressive discount.

Later, such documents were used for money transfer by Middle Eastern merchants, who had used the prototypes of bills of exchange ("[[suftadja]]" or "[[softa]]") from the 8th century to present. Such prototypes came to be used later by the Iberian and Italian merchants in the 12th century. In Italy in the 13–15th centuries, bills of exchange and promissory notes obtained their main features, while further phases of their development have been associated with France (16–18th centuries, where the endorsement had appeared) and Germany (19th century, formalization of Exchange Law). The first mention of the use of bills of exchange in English statutes dates from 1381, under [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the statute mandates the use of such instruments in England, and prohibits the future export of gold and silver [[Commodity money|specie]], in any form, to settle foreign commercial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Anderson (economist)|Adam Anderson]], [https://archive.org/stream/historicalchrono01ande#page/208/mode/2up An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce: from the earliest accounts to the present time. Containing, an history of the great commercial interests of the British empire...], Vol. I, p.209–210 (1764)&lt;/ref&gt; English exchange law was different than continental European law because of different legal systems; the English system was adopted later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bill of Exchange|volume=3|pages=940-943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern emphasis on negotiability may also be traced to [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]].&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; Germanic [[Lombards]] documents may also have some elements of negotiability.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jacob J.

== Distinguished from other types of contracts ==
[[File:British Foreign Bill stamps on 1870 Oriental Bank Corporation Bill of Exchange.jpg|thumbnail|right|An 1870 Bill of Exchange payable in London with British ''Foreign Bill'' [[revenue stamp]]s attached.]]
A negotiable instrument can serve to convey value constituting at least part of the performance of a [[contract]], albeit perhaps not obvious in contract formation, in terms inherent in and arising from the requisite [[offer and acceptance]] and conveyance of consideration. The underlying contract contemplates the right to hold the instrument as, and to negotiate the instrument to, a ''holder in due course'', the payment on which is at least part of the performance of the contract to which the negotiable instrument is linked. The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a "[[bearer instrument]]", wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment. Certain exceptions exist, such as instances of loss or theft of the instrument, wherein the possessor of the note may be a holder, but not necessarily a holder in due course. Negotiation requires a valid ''endorsement'' of the negotiable instrument.

The consideration constituted by a negotiable instrument is cognizable as the value given up to acquire it (benefit) and the consequent loss of value (detriment) to the prior holder; thus, no separate consideration is required to support an accompanying contract assignment. The instrument itself is understood as memorializing the right for, and power to demand, payment, and an obligation for payment evidenced by the instrument itself with possession as a holder in due course being the touchstone for the right to, and power to demand, payment. In some instances, the negotiable instrument can serve as the writing memorializing a contract, thus satisfying any applicable [[statute of frauds]] as to that contract.

=== The holder in due course ===
The rights of a [[holder in due course]] of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts:
* The rights to payment are not subject to [[Set-off (law)|set-off]], and do not rely on the validity of the underlying contract giving rise to the debt (for example if a cheque was drawn for payment for goods delivered but defective, the drawer is still liable on the cheque)
* No notice need be given to any party liable on the instrument for transfer of the rights under the instrument by negotiation. However, payment by the party liable to the person previously entitled to enforce the instrument "counts" as payment on the note until adequate notice has been received by the liable party that a different party is to receive payments from then on. [U.C.C. §3-602(b)]
* Transfer free of equities—the holder in due course can hold better title than the party he obtains it from (as in the instance of negotiation of the instrument from a mere holder to a holder in due course)

Negotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee’s own name. Negotiation can be effected by endorsement and delivery ([[order instrument]]s), or by delivery alone ([[bearer instrument]]s).

== Classes ==
Promissory notes and bills of exchange are two primary types of negotiable instruments.

=== Promissory note ===
Although possibly non-negotiable, a [[promissory note]] may be a negotiable instrument if it is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand to the ''payee'', or at fixed or determinable future time, certain in money, to order or to bearer. (see Sec. 194){{clarify|date=August 2016}} The law applicable to the specific instrument will determine whether it is a negotiable instrument or a non-negotiable instrument.

[[Bank notes]] are frequently referred to as promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. According to section 4 of India's [[Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881]], "a Promissory Note is an writing (not being a bank note or currency note), containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or the bearer of the instrument".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Bill of exchange ===
A bill of exchange or "draft" is a written order by the ''[[wiktionary:drawer|drawer]]'' to the ''[[wiktionary:drawee|drawee]]'' to pay money to the ''[[wiktionary:payee|payee]]''. A common type of bill of exchange is the [[cheque]] (''check'' in [[American English]]), defined as a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and payable on demand. Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today.
[[File:Credit1.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Bill of exchange, 1933]]
A bill of exchange is essentially an order made by one person to another to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties—the drawer, the drawee, and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the drawee. He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order.
A bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The "holder in due course" may claim the amount of the bill against the drawee and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the previous payee or endorser from doing so. This is what is meant by saying that a bill is negotiable.
In some cases a bill is marked "not negotiable"—see [[crossing of cheques]]. In that case it can still be transferred to a third party, but the third party can have no better right than the transferor.

== In the United States ==
{{Template:Globalize/English|section|date=September 2018}}
In the [[United States]], Articles 3 and 4 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC) govern the issuance and transfer of negotiable instruments, unless the instruments are governed by Article 8 of the UCC. The various [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|state law enactments]] of UCC §§ 3–104(a) through (d) set forth the legal definition of what is and what is not a ''negotiable instrument'':

{{quote|'''§ 3–104. NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.
(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:
(1) is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;
(2) is payable on demand or at a definite time; and
(3) does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain
(i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment,
(ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or
(iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.
(b) "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.
(c) An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and otherwise falls within the definition of "check" in subsection (f) is a negotiable instrument and a check.
(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.'''}}

Thus, for a writing to be a negotiable instrument under Article 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-104 |title=Uniform Commercial Code – Article 3 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following requirements must be met:
# The promise or order to pay must be unconditional;
# The payment must be a specific sum of money, although [[interest (finance)|interest]] may be added to the sum;
# The payment must be made on demand or at a definite time;
# The instrument must not require the person promising payment to perform any act other than paying the money specified;
# The instrument must be payable to bearer or to order.
The latter requirement is referred to as the "words of negotiability": a writing which does not contain the words "to the order of" (within the four corners of the instrument or in endorsement on the note or in [[allonge]]) or indicate that it is payable to the individual holding the contract document (analogous to the holder in due course) is not a negotiable instrument and is not governed by Article 3, even if it appears to have all of the other features of negotiability. The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a [[bank]]) and is not payable to order (i.e. if it just reads "pay John Doe") then it is treated as a negotiable instrument.

UCC Article 3 does not apply to money, to payment orders governed by Article 4A, or to securities governed by Article 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniformcommercialcode.uslegal.com/articles-of-the-ucc/#sthash.s8ZqcyK4.dpuf |title=Articles of the Uniform Commercial Code |publisher=Uniformcommercialcode.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation and endorsement {{anchor|endorsement}}===
Persons other than the original obligor and obligee can become parties to a negotiable instrument. The most common manner in which this is done is by placing one's [[signature]] on the instrument ("endorsement"): if the person who signs does so with the intention of obtaining payment of the instrument or acquiring or transferring rights to the instrument, the signature is called an ''endorsement''. There are five types of endorsements contemplated by the Code, covered in UCC [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-204 Article 3, Sections 204–206]:
*An endorsement which purports to transfer the instrument to a specified person is a ''special endorsement'' – for example, "Pay to the order of Amy";
*An endorsement by the payee or holder which does not contain any additional notation (thus purporting to make the instrument payable to bearer) is an ''endorsement in blank'' or ''[[blank endorsement]];''
*An endorsement which purports to require that the funds be applied in a certain manner (e.g. "{{visible anchor|for deposit only}}", "for collection") is a ''restrictive endorsement''; and,
*An endorsement purporting to disclaim retroactive liability is called a ''qualified endorsement'' (through the inscription of the words "without recourse" as part of the endorsement on the instrument or in [[allonge]] to the instrument).
*An endorsement purporting to add terms and conditions is called a ''conditional endorsement'' – for example, "Pay to the order of Amy, if she rakes my lawn next Thursday November 15th, 2007". The UCC states that these conditions may be disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-206 |title=Article 3, Sections 206(b) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If a note or draft is negotiated to a person who acquires the instrument
#in [[good faith]];
#for [[Value (economics)|value]];
#without notice of any [[defense (legal)|defense]]s to payment,
the transferee is a ''[[holder in due course]]'' and can enforce the instrument ''without'' being subject to defenses which the maker of the instrument would be able to assert against the original payee, except for certain ''real defenses''. These real defenses include (1) forgery of the instrument; (2) fraud as to the nature of the instrument being signed; (3) alteration of the instrument; (4) incapacity of the signer to contract; (5) infancy of the signer; (6) duress; (7) discharge in bankruptcy; and, (8) the running of a statute of limitations as to the validity of the instrument.
The ''holder-in-due-course rule'' is a ''rebuttable presumption'' that makes the free transfer of negotiable instruments feasible in the modern economy. A person or entity purchasing an instrument in the ordinary course of business can reasonably expect that it will be paid when presented to, and not subject to dishonor by, the maker, without involving itself in a dispute between the maker and the person to whom the instrument was first issued (this can be contrasted to the lesser rights and obligations accruing to mere holders). Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in a particular State's law contemplate ''real defenses'' available to purported holders in due course.
The foregoing is the theory and application presuming compliance with the relevant law. Practically, the obligor-payor on an instrument who feels he has been defrauded or otherwise unfairly dealt with by the payee may nonetheless refuse to pay even a holder in due course, requiring the latter to resort to [[lawsuit|litigation]] to recover on the instrument.

=== Usage ===
While bearer instruments are rarely created as such, a holder of [[commercial paper]] with the holder designated as payee can change the instrument to a bearer instrument by an endorsement. The proper holder simply signs the back of the instrument and the instrument becomes bearer paper, although in recent years, third party checks are not being honored by most banks unless the original payee has signed a notarized document stating such.

Alternatively, an individual or company may write a [[cheque|check]] payable to "cash" or "bearer" and create a bearer instrument. Great care should be taken with the security of the instrument, as it is legally almost as good as cash.

=== Exceptions ===
Under the Code, the following are not negotiable instruments, although the law governing obligations with respect to such items may be similar to or derived from the law applicable to negotiable instruments:
* [[Bill of lading|Bills of lading]] and other documents of title, which are governed by Article 7 of the Code.  However, under [[admiralty law]], a bill of lading may either be a negotiable or 'order' bill of lading or a nonnegotiable or 'straight' bill of lading.
* [[Deed]]s and other documents conveying interests in real estate, although a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] may secure a promissory note which is governed by Article 3
* [[IOU (debt)|IOU]]s
* [[Letters of credit]], which are governed by Article 5 of the Code

== Modern relevance ==
Although often considered foundational in business law, the modern relevance of negotiability has been questioned.&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;Mann RJ (1996). [http://www.columbia.edu/~mr2651/Data/SearchforNegotiability.pdf Searching for Negotiability in Payment and Credit Systems]. ''UCLA Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiability can be traced back to the 1700s and [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], when [[money]] and [[market liquidity|liquidity]] was relatively scarce.&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; The [[holder in due course]] rule has been limited by various statutes.&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; Concerns have also been raised that the [[holder in due course]] rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.&lt;ref name=Greenlee&gt;Greenlee MB, Fitzpatrck IV TJ. (2008).

'''Playbour''' (sometimes spelled '''playbor''') is a term used to describe a hybrid form of play and labour, specifically in the digital games industry. The term was coined by Julian Kücklich in 2005 in his article ''Precarious playbour: Modders and the digital games industry.'' Kücklich describes playbour as a type of free labour that fits neither traditional definitions of work nor the categories of play or leisure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue5/kucklich_print.html|title=Precarious Playbour: Modders and the Digital Games Industry|last=Kücklich|first=Julian|date=|website=journal.fibreculture.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, forms of playbour are often incorrectly perceived as being just an extension of play. Playbour is also sometimes categorized as a part of the [[gamification]] of society in general.

== History ==
While the term playbour itself is a relatively new invention, the phenomena it concerns – those of productive leisure and free labour in the digital games industry – have been around at least since the late 1990s. Kücklich states that since the early 1990s, the relationship between the players of digital games and the digital games industry has changed substantially. He attributes the alteration to the rise of computer [[game modification]], or "modding", as a widespread practice among players.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modding ===
Creating [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] for digital games is the perfect example of playbour: a growing number of consumers of digital games are not satisfied with just playing the game, but prefer to enhance their playing experience by creating content for the game themselves. In modding we can see the very essence of playbour, or free labour: while the work of creating a modification can be seen as playful and enjoyable, it is still work. In this respect modding can be fairly similar to another form of collaborative digital production; [[Open-source software|open-source]] software development. The first game to gain a modder base of considerable size is widely agreed to be [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] (1993).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sotamaa|first=Olli|date=3 September 2007|title=On modder labour, commodification of play, and mod competitions|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2006|journal=First Monday|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Doom mods is usually attributed to the fact that the game's code was deliberately designed to facilitate player-created content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most famous modder creation is probably [[Counter-Strike]], originally a team-based mod for [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] (1998). It later also became the first commercially released mod.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversy around playbour and modding ==
Not only is modding a big part of [[Video game culture|gaming culture]], but it is also an increasingly important source of value for the digital games industry. Game companies usually retain the [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] of the modifications. Since players need to have a copy of the original game to run the modifications, mods may add to the shelf-life of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to that, mods may help with establishing [[brand]]s (e.g. Counter-Strike), thus saving companies a significant amount of money. Marketing costs often take up a large percentage of a game's budget, but successfully established brands require less marketing. Mods also increase customer loyalty and are an important source of innovation in the digital games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way that game companies can benefit from the modding culture is that they can recruit modders as employees who are already trained at no cost to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/playbour-farming-and-labour|title=Playbour, farming and labour|last=Goggin|first=Joyce|date=|website=www.ephemerajournal.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While game companies may benefit economically from playbour, the players doing the work are not entirely uncompensated: they may obtain virtual in-game rewards or social capital such as followers on [[social media]]. The experience of play also has value in itself.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/10/15/gamification-playbor-exploitation-2/|title=Gamification, Playbor &amp; Exploitation|last=Patella-Rey|first=PJ|date=16 October 2012|work=The Society Pages|access-date=2018-02-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playbour is a voluntary activity and players don't usually view modding as labour. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that playboures are exploited by the games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Recruitee''' is [[Software as a service]] (Saas) that functions as an [[applicant tracking system]] (ATS). It includes a careers site editor for [[employer branding]], a plugin for [[sourcing (personnel)]], [[job board]] integration, email and calendar [[synchronization]]. Within 4 months after its public launch in August 2015, Recruitee attracted over 1000 [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) and recruiting agencies worldwide.

== History ==

In 2011, Perry Oostdam met Pawel Smoczyk on [[Founder2be]], a [[social network]] that helps aspiring [[entrepreneurs]] find their [[co-founder]]. Working remotely from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Poland]], they put together their first product - a mobile activation [[game]] called GeoRun.&lt;ref name="recruitee founders"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@PerryDam/the-u-turn-of-our-startup-ae50e6599b03/  |title=The U-turn of Our Startup|date=9 December 2015 |publisher=[[Medium.com]]|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Oostdam and Smoczyk pivoted the business and built Recruitee out of their own frustration with the hassles of [[Recruitment|hiring]].&lt;ref name="recruitee pivot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.saas-invaders.co/perry-oostdam-the-story-of-a-successful-pivot/ |author=Tom Benattar |title=Perry Oostdam - The Story of A Successful Pivot|date=11 September 2015 |publisher=SaaS Invaders|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe hiring should be a team effort, not only for founders and HR alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Tim|title=Recruitee: Smart Hiring on the Cloud co-Founder Interview|url=http://sociable.co/business/recruitee-smart-hiring/|website=Sociable.co|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recruitee Makes Hiring Easy On the Cloud|url=http://thestartupmag.com/recruitee-makes-hiring-easy-cloud/|website=Startup Magazine|accessdate=3 October 2016|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its launch, Recruitee quickly became popular and got an undisclosed amount of seed funding in September 1, 2015. Its board members include Dutch entrepreneurs Robert Pijselman and Luc Brandts.&lt;ref name="fjfdfb advisory board"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamwire.com/2015/09/recruitee-com-seed-funding/122314/ |author=Sujata Sangwan |title=Hiring Platform Recruitee.com Raises Seed Round of Funding|date=8 September 2015 |publisher=iamWire|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Recruitee announced a partnership with Rockstart, an accelerator in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="talent pool partner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstart.com/blog/introducing-talent-pool/|author=Catherine |title=Introducing Talent Pool|date=20 November 2015|publisher=Rockstart|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitee set up a Talent Pool that let applicants apply to job openings from all startups that are and were affiliated with Rockstart.

Recruitee's current clients include [[Vice (magazine)]], Usabilla, and [[Vlisco]].&lt;ref name="clients"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.co/recruitee-recruiting-software-to-hire-the-best-talent-2016-02 |title=Recruitee: A Recruiting Software to Hire the Best Talent|date=5 February 2016|publisher=Tech Cocktail|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

'''The SITEI (Sustainability in the Extractive Industries) Conference''' is an annual conference and workshop for key stakeholders and industry experts in [[natural resource#extraction|extractive industries]], which has been held in [[Abuja]], [[Nigeria]], since 2012.&lt;ref name="SITEI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/07/csr-action-partners-neiti-nnpc-others-host-sitei-2017/ |title=CSR-in-Action partners NEITI, NNPC, others to host SITEI 2017|website=Vanguard |date=2017-07-10 |accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SITEI2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/business/downstream-oil-sector-has-10bn-investments-deficit--kachikwu/206277.html |title=Downstream oil sector has $10bn investments deficit – Kachikwu|website=Daily Trust |date=2017-07-20 |accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The SITEI Conference was established together with the Deputy [[Canadian High Commissions|High Commission of Canada]] in October 2012, in [[Lagos]].&lt;ref name="SITEI" /&gt; Over the years, the conferences have been attended by business executives, the most senior government officers for the industries, and the representatives of various organizations.&lt;ref name="SITEI3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellanaija.com/2017/08/6th-sustainability-in-the-extractive-industries-sitei-conference/ |title=CSR-in-Action’s SITEI 2017 hosts Honourable Ministers Dr. Ibe Kachikwu &amp; Dr. Kayode Fayemi|website=Bella Naija |date=2017-08-07 |accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SITEI4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/210419-nigeria-award-coal-mining-licenses-power-generating-firms.html |title=Nigeria to award coal mining licenses to only power generating firms|website=Premium Times |date=2016-09-14 |accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2015 conference, all the stakeholders including the [[Federal government of Nigeria|Nigerian government]] endorsed plans to develop the [[mining industry of Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="SITEI9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steelguru.com/mining/plans-to-develop-nigerian-mining-sector-endorsed/440275 |title=Plans to develop Nigerian mining sector endorsed|website=Steel Guru |date=2015-12-01 |accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 conference grew to two days, featuring 25 speakers from the sector and 500 senior executives.&lt;ref name="SITEI" /&gt;

Where representations of a customer are held in more than one [[data set]], achieving a single customer view can be difficult: firstly because customer identity must be traceable between the records held in those systems, and secondly because anomalies or discrepancies in the customer data must be [[data cleansing|data cleansed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atominsight.com/about-us/blog/single-customer-view-hard|title=Why building a single customer view isn’t as easy as you might think|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the acquisition by an organisation of a single customer view is one potential outcome of successful [[master data management]]. Since 31 December, 2010, maintaining a single customer view, and submitting it within 72 hours, has become mandatory for [[financial institution]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] due to new rules introduced by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Experian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fscs.org.uk/industry/single-customer-view/|title=Deposit Guarantee Scheme - Customer Review -FSCS|website=www.fscs.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32241">'''Small and medium-sized enterprises''' ('''SMEs''') or '''small and medium-sized businesses''' ('''SMBs''') are [[business]]es whose personnel numbers fall below certain limits. The abbreviation "SME" is used by international organizations such as the [[World Bank]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).

SMEs outnumber large companies by a wide margin and also employ many more people. For example, Australian SMEs make up 97% of all Australian businesses, produced one third of total GDP, and employ 4.7 million people. In Chile, in the commercial year 2014, 98.5% of the firms were classified as SMEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chile|date=2016-04-14|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/industry-and-services/financing-smes-and-entrepreneurs-2016/chile_fin_sme_ent-2016-11-en|work=Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs|pages=155–173|publisher=OECD Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1787/fin_sme_ent-2016-11-en|isbn=9789264249462|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tunisia, the self-employed workers alone account for about 28% of the total non-farm employment and firms with fewer than 100 employees account for about 62% of total employment.&lt;ref&gt;Rijkers et al (2014): "Which firms create the most jobs in developing countries?", ''Labour Economics'', Volume 31, December 2014, pp.84–102&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, smaller (micro) and informal firms, have a larger share than in developed countries&lt;!-- need citations --&gt;. SMEs are also said to be responsible for driving innovation and competition in many economic sectors. Although they create more jobs, there is also a majority of job destruction/contraction.&lt;ref&gt;Aga et al (2015): [https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/~/media/GIAWB/EnterpriseSurveys/Documents/ResearchPapers/SMEs-age-and-jobs.pdf SMEs, Age, and Jobs: A Review of the Literature, Metrics, and Evidence], World Bank Group, November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
SMEs are important for economic and social reasons, given the sectors role in employment. Due to their sizes, SME are heavily influenced by their Chief Executive Officers, a.k.a. CEOs. The CEOs of SMEs often are the founders, owners, and manager of the SMEs. The duties of a CEO in SME is difficult just like the CEOs of big companies. A CEO needs to strategically allocate her/his time, energy, and assets to direct the SMEs. Typically, the CEO Is the strategist, champion and leader for developing the SME or the prime reason for the business failing{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

At the employee level, Petrakis and Kostis (2012) explore the role of interpersonal trust and knowledge in the number of small and medium enterprises. They conclude that knowledge positively affects the number of SMEs, which in turn, positively affects interpersonal trust. Note that the empirical results indicate that interpersonal trust does not affect the number of SMEs. Therefore, although knowledge development can reinforce SMEs, trust becomes widespread in a society when the number of SMEs is greater.&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Petrakis, P.C. Kostis (2012), “[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13132-012-0115-6 Τhe Role of Knowledge and Trust in SMEs]”, Journal of the Knowledge Economy, DOI: 10.1007/s13132-012-0115-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SME leadership ===
SMEs' top management teams' leadership styles have an essential effect on business success and the development of SMEs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jianhong|last2=Nadkarni|first2=Sucheta|date=2017-03-01|title=It’s about Time! CEOs’ Temporal Dispositions, Temporal Leadership, and Corporate Entrepreneurship|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839216663504|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=31–66|doi=10.1177/0001839216663504|issn=0001-8392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many SMEs do not have a board and rely on its top management team (TMT), the top managers of a firm, to make the strategic decisions.

== SME strategies ==
To thrive in our changing and complex business world, the modern SME must formulate strategies on where it wants to be in its marketplace. Its leadership then needs to acquire, and use wisely, the right human, financial and other resources to get there.

=== Flexibility ===
SMEs face a lot of uncertainty and need to be flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadkarni|first=Sucheta|last2=Herrmann|first2=Pol|date=2010-10|title=CEO Personality, Strategic Flexibility, and Firm Performance: The Case of the Indian Business Process Outsourcing Industry|url=https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMJ.2010.54533196|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1050–1073|doi=10.5465/amj.2010.54533196|issn=0001-4273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ambidexterity ===
SMEs need to balance many things at the same time, and being ambidextrous at tasks is key.

===[[Dynamic capabilities|Dynamic capability]]===
In our changing and complex business world, the modern SME should have the ability to change themselves.

=== Innovation/[[corporate entrepreneurship]]===
While startups are known for their innovation, SMEs often are small and focused enough to bring out innovation as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chin|first=M. K.|last2=Zhang|first2=Stephen Xu|last3=Afshar Jahanshahi|first3=Asghar|last4=Nadkarni|first4=Sucheta|date=2018-07|title=The Effect of Two Dimensions of CEO Political Ideology on Corporate Entrepreneurship|url=https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.39|journal=Academy of Management Proceedings|language=en|volume=2018|issue=1|pages=12910|doi=10.5465/ambpp.2018.39|issn=0065-0668}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bribery is an often-quiet but prevalent strategies of SMEs in many parts of the world.

===[[E-commerce|E-Commerce]] and online strategy ===
In the internet and mobile world, SMEs face unique motivation and barriers in their [[e-commerce]] and online strategy. SMEs find an "enhanced company brand and corporate image" to be the most important e-commerce advantage, whereas "doubts about the security and privacy" is the most important barrier for SMEs to have an e-commerce and online strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Afshar Jahanshahi|first=Asghar|last2=X.

== Legal boundary on SMEs around the world ==
Multilateral organizations have been criticized for using one measure for all.&lt;ref&gt;Kushnir (2010) [http://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/a-universal-definition-of-small-enterprise-a-procrustean-bed-for-smes A Universal Definition of Small Enterprise: A Procrustean bed for SMEs?], World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, T.; van der Vaart, H.J.

=== Africa ===
{{refimprove section|date = May 2015}}

==== Egypt ====
Most of Egypt's businesses are small-sized, with 97 percent employing fewer than 10 workers, according to census data released by state-run statistics body CAPMAS.

Medium-sized enterprises with 10 to 50 employees account for around 2.7 percent of total businesses. However, big businesses with over 50 employees account for 0.4 percent of all enterprises nationwide.

The data is part of Egypt's 2012/13 economic census on establishments ranging from small stalls to big enterprises. Economic activity outside the establishments – like street vendors and farmers, for example – were excluded from the census.

The results show that Egypt is greatly lacking in medium-sized businesses.

Seventy percent of the country's 2.4 million businesses have only one or two employees. But less than 0.1 percent – only 784 businesses – employ between 45 and 49 people.

==== Kenya ====
In Kenya, the term changed to MSME, which stands for "micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises".

For micro enterprises, the maximum number of employees is up to 10 employees. For small enterprises, it is from 10 to 50. For medium enterprises, it is from 50 to 100.

==== Nigeria ====
The [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] defines small and medium enterprises in Nigeria according to asset base and number of staff employed. The criteria are an asset base that is between [[Naira|N5]]&amp;nbsp;million to [[Naira|N500]] million, and a staff strength that is between 11 and 100 employees.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2010/publications/guidelines/dfd/GUIDELINES%20ON%20N200%20BILLION%20SME%20CREDIT%20GUARANTEE.pdf|title=N200 BILLION SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES CREDIT GUARANTEE SCHEME(SMECGS)|last=Central Bank Of Nigeria|first=|date=March 30, 2010|website=|publisher=Central Bank of Nigeria|access-date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Somalia ====
In Somalia, the term is SME (for "small, medium, and micro enterprises"); elsewhere in Africa, MSME stands for "micro, small, and medium enterprises". An SME is defined as a small business that has more than 30 employees but less than 500 employees.

==== South Africa ====

In the National Small Business Amendment Act 26 0f 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic of South Africa, National Small Business Amendment Act|url=http://www.thedti.gov.za/business_regulation/acts/small_business_amendment_act.pdf|publisher=www.thedti.gov.za|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''micro-businesses''' in the different sectors, varying from the manufacturing to the retail sectors, are defined as businesses with five or fewer employees and a turnover of up to R100,000 [[South African Rand|ZAR]]. '''Very small businesses''' employ between 6 and 20 employees, while '''small businesses''' employ between 21 and 50 employees. The upper limit for turnover in a small business varies from R1 million in the Agricultural sector to R13 million in the Catering, Accommodations and other Trade sector as well as in the Manufacturing sector, with a maximum of R32 million in the Wholesale Trade sector.

'''Medium-sized businesses''' usually employ up to 200 people (100 in the Agricultural sector), and the maximum turnover varies from R5 million in the Agricultural sector to R51 million in the Manufacturing sector and R64 million in the Wholesale Trade, Commercial Agents and Allied Services sector.

A comprehensive definition of an SME in South Africa is therefore any enterprise with one or more of the following characteristics: 
* Fewer than 200 employees
* Annual turnover of less than R64 million
* Capital assets of less than R10 million
* Direct managerial involvement by owners&lt;ref&gt;Du Toit.Erasmus.&amp; Strydom "Definition of a small business" ''Introduction to business management, 7th Edition'' Oxford University press,2009, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===

==== India ====
Under section 7 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006, the Indian government defined the size of micro, small, and medium enterprises as:&lt;ref name="MSMED-Act"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.msmeodisha.gov.in/PDF/MSMED_Act.pdf | title=THE MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT ACT, 2006 | journal=The Gazette of India |date=June 2006  | volume=31 | pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote box

|(a) in the case of the enterprises engaged in the manufacture of goods pertaining to any industry specified in the First Schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, as—

(i) a micro enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery does not exceed twenty-five lakh rupees

(ii) a small enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than twenty-five lakh rupees but does not exceed five crore rupees; or

(iii) a medium enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than five crore rupees but does not exceed ten crore rupees;

(b) in the case of the enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services, as—

(i) a micro enterprise, where the investment in equipment does not exceed ten lakh rupees;

(ii) a small enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than ten lakh rupees but does not exceed two crore rupees; or

(iii) a medium enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than two crore rupees but does not exceed five crore rupees.}}

Businesses that are declared as MSMEs and within specific sectors and criteria can then apply for "priority sector" lending to help with business expenses; banks have annual targets set by the Prime Minister's Task Force on MSMEs for year-on-year increases of lending to various categories of MSMEs.&lt;ref name=MSMED-RBI&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/commonman/English/scripts/FAQs.aspx?Id=966|publisher=Reserve Bank of India|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indonesia ====

In Indonesia, the government defines micro, small, and medium enterprises ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Usaha Mikro Kecil dan Menengah'', UMKM) based on their assets and revenues according to Law No. 20/2008:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesian Government Law No. 20 of 2008|url=http://eng.kppu.go.id/newkppu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LAW-OF-THE-REPUBLIC-OF-INDONESIA-20-OF-2008.pdf|publisher=Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual revenue of Rp 50 billion is approximately equal to USD 3.7 million as of November 2017.

==== Bangladesh ====

In Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank defines Small and medium enterprises based on Fixed Asset, Employed Manpower and Yearly turn over and they are definitely not Public Limited Co. and requires these characteristics -

==== Singapore ====

With effect from 1 April 2011, the definition of SMEs is businesses with annual sales turnover of not more than $100 million or employing no more than 200 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet on New SME Definition|url=https://www.spring.gov.sg/NewsEvents/PR/Documents/Fact_Sheet_on_New_SME_Definition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== European Union ====
The criteria for defining the size of a business differ from country to country, with many countries having programs of [[business rate]] reduction and financial subsidy for SMEs. According to the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is an SME? - Small and medium sized enterprises (SME) - Enterprise and Industry |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm |website=ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2015-06-12 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208090338/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the SME are the enterprises that meet the following definition of staff headcount and either the turnover or balance sheet total definitions:

In July 2011, the European Commission said it would open a consultation on the definition of SMEs in 2012. In Europe, there are three broad parameters which define SMEs:
* [[Micro-enterprise]]s have up to 10 employees
* Small enterprises have up to 50 employees
* Medium-sized enterprises have up to 250 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = European Commission | authorlink = European Commission | title = Recommendation 2003/361/EC: SME Definition | date = 2003-05-06 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm | accessdate = 2012-09-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150208090338/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm | archivedate = 2015-02-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The European definition of SME follows: "The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/files/sme_definition/sme_user_guide_en.pdf Enterprise and Industry Publications: The new SME definition, user guide and model declaration], Extract of Article 2 of the Annex of Recommendation 2003/361/EC&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prepare for an evaluation and revision of some features of the small and medium-sized enterprises definition European Union established public consultation period from 6 February 2018 to 6 May 2018. Public consultation is available for all EU member country citizens and organizations. Especially, national and regional authorities, enterprises, business associations or organizations, venture capital providers, research and academic institutions, and individual citizens are expected as the main contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/public-consultation-review-sme-|title=Consultations|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU member states have had individual definitions of what constitutes an SME. For example, the definition in [[Germany]] had a limit of 255 [[employee]]s, while in [[Belgium]] it could have been 100.  The result is that while a Belgian business of 249 employees would be taxed at full rate in Belgium, it would nevertheless be eligible for SME subsidy under a European-labelled programme.

SMEs are a crucial element in the supplier network of large enterprises which are already on their way towards [[Industry 4.0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommer|first1=Lutz|title=Industrial revolution - industry 4.0: Are German manufacturing SMEs the first victims of this revolution?|journal=Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management|date=28 November 2015|volume=8|issue=5|doi=10.3926/jiem.1470}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to German economist [[Hans-Heinrich Bass]], "empirical research on SME as well as policies to promote SME have a long tradition in [West] Germany, dating back into the 19th century. Until the mid-20th century most researchers considered SME as an impediment to further economic development and SME policies were thus designed in the framework of social policies. Only the [[Ordoliberalism]] school, the founding fathers of Germany's [[social market economy]], discovered their strengths, considered SME as a solution to mid-20th century economic problems (mass unemployment, abuse of economic power), and laid the foundations for non-selective (functional) industrial policies to promote SMEs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwim.uni-bremen.de/publikationen/pdf/b101.pdf Hans-Heinrich Bass: KMU in der deutschen Volkswirtschaft: Vergangenheit, Gegenwart, Zukunft, ''Berichte aus dem Weltwirtschaftlichen Colloquium der Universität Bremen'' Nr. 101, Bremen 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215101921/http://www.iwim.uni-bremen.de/publikationen/pdf/b101.pdf |date=2017-12-15 }} (PDF; 96&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Poland =====
The SME sector in Poland generates almost 50% of the GDP, and out of that, for instance, in 2011, micro companies
generated 29.6%, small companies 7.7%, and medium companies 10.4% (big companies 24.0%; other entities 16.5%,
and revenues from customs duties and taxes generated 11.9%). In 2011, out of the total of 1,784,603 entities operating in Poland, merely 3,189 were classified as "large", so 1,781,414 were micro, small, or medium.
Companies of the SMEs sector employed 6.3 million people out of the total of 9.0 million of labour employed in the
private sector. In Poland in 2011 was 36.2 SMEs per 1,000 of inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/view/1144/1173 D. Walczak, G. Voss, New Possibilities of Supporting Polish SMEs within the Jeremie Initiative Managed by BGK, Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, Vol 4, No 9, p. 760-761].&lt;/ref&gt;

===== United Kingdom =====
In the UK a company is defined as being an SME if it meets two out of three criteria: it has a turnover of less than £25m, it has fewer than 250 employees, it has gross assets of less than £12.5m.&lt;ref name="BIS SME definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/mid-sized-businesses|website=gov.uk|publisher=Department of Business, Innovation and Skills|title=Mid-sized businesses|accessdate=11 June 2015|ref=bis_sme_definition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many small and medium-sized businesses form part of the UK's currently growing ''[[Mittelstand]]'', or ''Brittelstand'' as it is also often named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7bbbf9e8-1f35-11e5-ab0f-6bb9974f25d0|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are businesses in Britain that are not only small or medium but also have a much broader set of values and more elastic definition.

The [[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]] estimated that at the start of 2014, 99.3% of UK [[private sector]] businesses were SMEs, with their £1.6 trillion annual [[revenue|turnover]] accounting for 47% of private sector turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridging loans UK can be used for many purposes|url=http://konnectfinancial.co.uk/loan-products/bridging-loans/|website=www.konnectfinancial.co.uk|publisher=Konnect Financial|accessdate=10 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011052641/http://konnectfinancial.co.uk/loan-products/bridging-loans/|archive-date=11 October 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ukbis-"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/377934/bpe_2014_statistical_release.pdf | title=Statistical Release: Business Population Estimates for the UK and Regions 2014 | publisher=Department for Business Innovation and Skills | date=26 November 2014 | accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to support SMEs, the UK government set a target in 2010 "''that 25% of government’s spend, either directly or in supply chains, goes to SMEs by 2015''"; it achieved this by 2013.&lt;ref name="ukgov-SMEspend"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-government-buying/2010-to-2015-government-policy-government-buying#appendix-1-making-sure-government-gets-full-value-from-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises | title=2010 to 2015 government policy: government buying | date=20 February 2013 | accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Switzerland ====

In [[Switzerland]], the [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)|Federal Statistical Office]] defines small and medium-sized enterprises as companies with less than 250 employees.&lt;ref name=BFS&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/statistiques/industrie-services/entreprises-emplois/structure-economie-entreprises/taille-forme-juridique-secteurs-repartition-regionale.html Taille, forme juridique, secteurs, répartition régionale], [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)|Swiss Federal Statistical Office]] (page visited on 24 October 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The categories are the following:&lt;ref name=BFS/&gt;
* Microentreprises: 1 to 9 employees.
* Small enterprises: 10 to 49 employees.
* Medium-sized enterprises: 50 to 249  employees.
* Large enterprises: 250 employees or more.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
[[Industry Canada]] defines a small business as one with fewer than 100 paid employees and a medium-sized business as one with at least 100 and fewer than 500 employees.  As of December 2012, there were 1,107,540 employer businesses in Canada, of which 1,087,803 were small. Small businesses make up 98.2 percent of employer businesses, medium-sized businesses make up 1.6 percent of employer businesses and large businesses make up 0.1 percent of employer businesses. In 2012, over 7.7 million employees, or 69.7 percent of the total private labour force, worked for small businesses and 2.2 million employees, or 20.2 percent of the labour force, worked for medium-sized businesses. In total, SMEs employed about 10 million individuals, or 89.9 percent of employees. Canadian high-growth firms are present in every economic sector and are not just concentrated in knowledge-based industries. In terms of employment, the highest concentrations of high-growth firms in Canada during the 2006–2009 period were in construction (4.9 percent of all firms); business, building and other support services (4.6 percent); and professional, scientific and technical services (4.5 percent). In 2011, only 10.4 percent of SMEs exported. Nonetheless, they were responsible for $150 billion, or about 41.0 percent, of Canada's total value of exports.&lt;ref name="CAstats-Aug13"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/h_02800.html | title=Key Small Business Statistics - August 2013 | publisher=Industry Canada | work=ic.gc.ca | date=2013-09-13 | accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations in Canada are generally taxed at 29% federally.  Canadian Controlled private corporations receive a 17% reduction in the tax rate on taxable income from active businesses up to $500,000.  This small business deduction is reduced for corporations whose taxable capital exceeding $10M, and is completely eliminated for corporations whose taxable capital exceeds $15M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T2 Corporation - Income Tax Guide - Chapter 4: Page 4 of the T2 return|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4012/t4012-06-e.html|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that almost $2 trillion of Canadian SMEs will be coming up for sale over the next decade which is twice as large as the assets of the top 1,000 Canadian pension plans and approximately the same size as Canadian annual GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equicapita.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Equicapita_May_050214.pdf|title=Equicapita May 2014 - Who Will Buy Baby Boomer Businesses?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
The small and medium-sized companies in Mexico are called [[Small and medium enterprises in Mexico|PYMEs]], which is a direct translation of SMEs. But there's another categorization in the country called MiPyMEs. The MiPyMEs are micro, small and medium-sized businesses, with an emphasis on micro which are one man companies or a type of freelance.

==== United States ====
In the [[United States]], the [[Small Business Administration]] sets [[small business]] criteria based on industry, ownership structure, revenue and number of employees (which in some circumstances may be as high as 1500, although the cap is typically 500).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Small Business Administration|title=Size Standards|accessdate=2011-08-21|url=http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/contracting/contracting-officials/size-standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the US and the EU generally use the same threshold of fewer than 10 employees for [[small office]]s (SOHO).{{Citation needed|reason=A citation is needed for the claim that the European Union and Small Business Administration have a size-standard classification for the term small office or SOHO|date=February 2014}}

Also in the [[United States]], small and medium-sized manufacturers are referred to as SMMs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|title=Targeting Small and Medium-Sized Manufacturers|accessdate=2017-04-03|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/mep/data/ACEE.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the US Department of Energy classifies as having gross annual sales below $100 million, fewer than 500 employees at the plant site, and annual energy bills more than $100,000 but less than $2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Industrial Assessment Center Small-Mid Size Manufacturer Criteria|title=Industrial Assessment Centers|accessdate=2017-04-03|url=https://energy.gov/eere/amo/industrial-assessment-centers-iacs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====
{{refimprove section|date = May 2015}}
In Australia, a SME has 200 or fewer employees. Microbusinesses have 1–4 employees, small businesses 5–19, medium businesses 20–199, and large businesses 200+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1321.0|title = 1321.0 - Small Business in Australia, 2001|date = 23 October 2002|accessdate = 30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian SMEs make up 97% of all Australian businesses, produced one third of total GDP, and employ 4.7 million people. SMEs represent 90 per cent of all goods exporters and over 60% of services exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusinessassociation.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/INTRODUCTION-TO-FTRA.pdf|format=PDF|title=AN INTRODUCTION TO FTAs (FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS)|publisher=Small Business Association of Australia, 2015|accessdate=29 March 2016}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stakeholder management''' is a critical component to the successful delivery of any project, programme or activity. A [[Project stakeholders|stakeholder]] is any individual, group or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a programme.&lt;ref name="Stakeholder Identification"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sowden |first1=Rod |last2=Office |first2=Cabinet |date=August 30, 2011 |title=Managing successful programmes |publisher=Stationery Office |page=59| isbn=9780113313273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stakeholder management creates positive relationships with stakeholders through the appropriate management of their expectations and agreed objectives. Stakeholder management is a process and control that must be planned and guided by underlying principles. Stakeholder management within businesses, organizations, or projects prepares a [[strategy]] using information (or intelligence) gathered during the following common processes.

==Stakeholder identification==
{{main|Stakeholder analysis}}
The first step in your stakeholder analysis is to brainstorm who your stakeholders are. As part of this, think of all the people who are affected by your work, who have influence or power over it, or have an interest in its successful or unsuccessful conclusion. Remember that although stakeholders may be both [[organization]]s and [[people]], ultimately you must communicate with people. Make sure that you identify the correct individual stakeholders within a stakeholder organization.&lt;ref name="Prioritize Your Stakeholders"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sowden |first1=Rod |last2=Office |first2=Cabinet |date=August 30, 2011 |title=Managing successful programmes |publisher=Stationery Office |page=64| isbn=9780113313273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

So in a nutshell, the stakeholder management comprises four steps:&lt;ref name="Stakeholder management"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.apm.org.uk/bok/stakeholder-management |title=APM Knowledge Stakeholder management |author=Association for Project Management (APM)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Identify, recognize and acknowledge stakeholder;
* Determine their influence and interest;
* Establish [[communication management]] plan
* Influencing and engaging stakeholder

==Stakeholder prioritization ==
You may now have a long list of people and organizations that are affected by your work. Some of these may have the power either to block or advance. Some may be interested in what you are doing, others may not care. Map out your stakeholders on a Power/Interest Grid, and classify them by their power over your work and by their interest in your work. There are other tools available to map out your stakeholders and how best to influence them.

For example, your boss is likely to have high power and influence over your projects and high interest. Your family may have high interest, but are unlikely to have power over it. Someone's position on the grid shows you the actions you have to take with them:
*'''High power, interested people:''' these are the people you must fully engage and make the greatest efforts to satisfy.
*'''High power, less interested people:''' put enough work in with these people to keep them satisfied, but not so much that they become bored with your message.
*'''Low power, interested people:''' keep these people adequately informed, and talk to them to ensure that no major issues are arising. These people can often be very helpful with the detail of your project.
*'''Low power, less interested people:''' again, monitor these people, but do not bore them with excessive communication.

==Understanding your key stakeholders==
You now need to know more about your key stakeholders. You need to know how they are likely to feel about and react to your project. You also need to know how best to engage them in your project and how best to communicate with them.  Key questions that can help you understand your stakeholders are:
*What financial or emotional interest do they have in the outcome of your work? Is it positive or negative?
*What motivates them most of all?
*What information do they want from you?
*How do they want to receive information from you? What is the best way of communicating your message to them?
*What is their current opinion of your work? Is it based on good information?
*Who influences their opinions generally, and who influences their opinion of you? Do some of these influencers therefore become important stakeholders in their own right?
*If they are not likely to be positive, what will win them around to support your project?
*If you don't think you will be able to win them around, how will you manage their opposition?
*Who else might be influenced by their opinions? Do these people become stakeholders in their own right?

==Key principles of stakeholder engagement==
* Communicate: To ensure intended message is understood and the desired response achieved.
* Consult, early and often: To get the useful information and ideas, ask questions.
* Remember, they are human: Operate with an awareness of human feelings.
* Plan it: Time investment and careful planning against it, has a significant payoff.
* Relationship: Try to engender trust with the stakeholders. 
* Simple but not easy: Show your care. Be empathetic.Listen to the stakeholders.
* [[Risk management|Managing risk]]: Stakeholders can be treated as risk and opportunities that have probabilities and impact.
* Compromise: Compromise across a set of stakeholders' diverging priorities.
* Understand what is success: Explore the value of the project to the stakeholder.
* Take responsibility: Project governance is the key of project success

==Organizational stakeholders==
It is well acknowledged that any given organization will have multiple stakeholders including, but not limited to, customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and so forth. Within the field of marketing, it is believed that customers are one of the most important stakeholders for managing its long-term value, with a firm's major objective being the management of customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon E. Greenley and Gordon R. Foxall. (2003). Multiple Stakeholder Orientation in UK Companies and the Implications for Company Performance. ''Journal of Management Studies, 34'', 259–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engaging and communicating with stakeholders==

With a clear understanding of your Stakeholders, engaging and communicating can be achieved through a variety of channels based upon who the stakeholder is.&lt;ref name="Managing Stakeholder Expectations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pmiglc.org/PD/Uploads/PMIGreatLakesChapter_Dec2011Forum_GMoore.pdf |last=Moore |first=Gwendolyn |date=December 12, 2011 |title=PMI Great Lakes Chapter Forum, Tools and Techniques for Managing Stakeholder Expectations |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''High power, interested people:''' Manage closely. Best channels: [[Issue Log|Issue]], Change Logs, Status Meetings
*'''High power, less interested people:''' Keep satisfied. Best channels: Steering Committee, Board Meeting Updates
*'''Low power, interested people:''' Keep informed. Best channels: In-Person, Video, Email Updates
*'''Low power, less interested people:''' Monitor. Best channels: Send Email, Status Reports

'''Subordination''' in [[banking]] and [[finance]] refers to the order of priorities in claims for [[ownership]] or interest in various [[assets]].

==United States law==
===Subordination of debt===
'''Subordination''' is the process by which a creditor is placed in a lower priority for the collection of its debt from its debtor's assets than the priority the creditor previously had,&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 4th Ed. 1951, defining "subordinate."&lt;/ref&gt; In common parlance, the debt is said to be subordinated but in reality, it is the right of the creditor to collect the debt that has been reduced in priority. The priority of right to collect the debt is important when a debtor owes more than one creditor but has assets of insufficient value to pay them all in full at the time of a default. Except in [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, the creditor with the first priority for collection will generally have the first claim on the debtor's assets for its debt and the creditors whose rights are subordinate will thus have fewer assets to satisfy their claims. Subordination can take place by operation of law or by agreement among the creditors.

===Subordination of security priority===
Subordination is also an issue in the priority of [[security interest]]s in the ownership of property.  For example, in [[real estate]], [[mortgages]] and other [[liens]] on the title to secure the payment or repayment of money usually take their priority from the time they attach to the title.  The purpose of this ordering of priority is to determine, in a [[foreclosure]] resulting from a default, who gets paid first with the sale proceeds from the foreclosure proceeding.  Earlier mortgages or other liens are often subordinated by their holders to later ones in order to accomplish agreed-upon ends.  An example is for the holder of a mortgage on undeveloped land to subordinate that mortgage to a later construction loan mortgage.  The motivation is either the belief that improvement of the land will benefit the first lender or that the first mortgage requires that it be subordinated to a future construction loan.

The ''subordination percentage'' of a security is the percentage of the total capital which is subordinate to the security in question.  Thus, the security will not suffer any losses until after that percentage of capital has been lost.

====Dealer subordinable debt====
In the automotive financing industry, many dealerships are allowed to designate personal loans which are payable to the ownership as subordinable debt. The finance institution and dealership may come to an agreement which allows this debt to stay within the confines of the financial statement and concurrently improve the dealership financial position from a liquidity perspective.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

===Equitable subordination===
[[United States bankruptcy court|Bankruptcy courts in the United States]] have the power and authority to subordinate prior claims on the assets of a bankrupt debtor to the claims of junior claimants based on principles of equity.  This is a remedy called "equitable subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|510}}(c)&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for subordination is usually the inequitable conduct of the prior claimant with respect to junior claimants.&lt;ref&gt; See, e.g., ''Murphy v. Meritor Savings Bank'', [[Case citation|126 B.R. 370, 393, 413]] ([[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Bankr. D. Mass.]] 1991), in which an [[Leveraged buyout|LBO]] left the corporation with insufficient cash to operate for longer than 10 days.  In that case, the court not only avoided the mortgage securing the LBO debt, but it also subordinated the resulting lender's unsecured claim to the claims of all other creditors of the bankrupt debtor.&lt;/ref&gt;  Equitable subordination can be used to subordinate both secured and unsecured claims.

'''Sustainopreneurship''' (entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability) is a concept that has emerged from the earlier concepts [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[ecopreneurship]], via sustainability entrepreneurship. The concept means to use creative business organizing to solve problems related to sustainability to create social and environmental sustainability as a [[strategic objective]] and purpose, at the same time respecting the boundaries set in order to maintain the life support systems in the process. In other words, it is a "business with a cause" – where the [[global issues|world problems]] are turned into [[business opportunities]] by deployment of sustainability innovations. 

==Definition==

The definition first introduced in a conference article in 2006:&lt;ref name="ftn0"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2006) Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause. in Science Sustainable Development – Starting Points and Critical Reflections, Uppsala: VHU – Föreningen Vetenskap för Hållbar Utveckling (Swedish Society for Sustainable Development), pp. 21-30. {{ISBN|91-631-9222-5}}. [http://www.vhu.se/site/The-Swedish-Research-Association-for-Sustainable-Development.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Deployment of sustainability innovations: Entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability. 
# Short for sustainability intra-/entrepreneurship. 
# To focus on one or more (world/social/sustainability-related) problem(s), find/identify and/or invent a solution to the problem(s) and bring the innovation to the market by creating an efficient organization. With the (new alt. deep transformation of an old) mission/cause-oriented sustainability business adding ecological/economical/social values and gains, with a bias towards the intangible – through dematerialization/resocialization. The value added at the same time preserving, restoring and/or ultimately enhancing the underlying utilized capital stock, in order to maintain the capacity to fulfil the needs of present and coming generations of stakeholders.

==Conceptual development==

The business world has been nominated as a premier force for creating a sustainable world,&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;Hart, S. L. (2005) Capitalism at the Crossroads: the Unlimited Business Opportunities in Solving the World's Most Difficult Problems. Philadelphia: Wharton School Publishing., p 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;Prahalad, C. K. (2004) The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid – Eradicating Poverty Through Profits, Philadelphia: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; especially when acting as a source of innovation and creativity – e. g. as Robinson (2004:378)&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;Robinson, J. (2004)'' ''Squaring the Circle? Some thoughts on the idea of Sustainable Development, ''Ecological Economics,'' 48:4, pp. 369-384.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it:

:''"In addition to integrating across fields, sustainability must also be integrated across sectors or interests. It is clear that governments alone have neither the will nor the capability to accomplish sustainability on their own. The private sector, as the chief engine of economic activity on the planet, and '''a major source for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship,''' must be involved in trying to achieve sustainability."'' 

Sustainopreneurship is a candidate to be the accentuating factor to give even more leverage to forces emerging from world of business activities to contribute to sustainability. The concept of sustainopreneurship was first introduced as a term in 2000&lt;ref name="ftn4"&gt;Schaltegger, S. (2000) Vom Bionier zum Sustainopreneur, Presentation at Rio Impuls Management Forum 2000, Home Page of conference {{cite web |url=http://www.rio.ch/Pages/archiv/2000rmf.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001904/http://www.rio.ch/Pages/archiv/2000rmf.html |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, presentation accessible at {{cite web |url=http://www.rio.ch/Pages/rmf2000/referate/Schaltegger.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707002241/http://www.rio.ch/Pages/rmf2000/referate/Schaltegger.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, (accessed 2007-04-16).&lt;/ref&gt; where it was predominantly related to the proactive change management approaches associated with process adjustment with increased respect to the environment. The phenomenon developed with publications in 2003,&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;Hockerts, K. (2003) Sustainability Innovation: Ecological and Social Entrepreneurship and the Managing of Antagonistic Assets'', ''PhD Dissertation, University of St. Gallen, Schweiz.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;Gerlach, A. (2003a) Sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation, Centre for Sustainability Management, University of Lueneburg, Conference Proceedings of Conference Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management 2003 in Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn7"&gt;Gerlach, A. (2003b) Innovativität und Sustainability Intrapreneurship,'' ''Paper presented at Sustainable Management in Action '03, University of St. Gallen, Schweiz.&lt;/ref&gt; and further evolved and was tentatively defined in 2006 by Anders Abrahamsson.&lt;ref name="ftn8"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2006), Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This tentative definition was empirically tested in his Master thesis,&lt;ref name="ftn11"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007a) Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause: Conceptualizing Entrepreneurship for Sustainability. [Master Thesis in Business Administration.] Växjö: Reports from Växjö University: Business administration and economics. http://www.diva-portal.org/vxu/abstract.xsql?dbid=1254, (accessed 2007-05-25).&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where the enactive research process&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2002) Enacting Entrepreneurship – Using Auto-Ethnography to Study Organization Creation, Paper presented the conference ''Ethnographic Organizational Studies'', University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, September 19-21, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005) Entreprenörskapets väsen, Lund: Studentlitteratur.&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that the definition stood the test contrasting it towards the auto-ethnographical empirical material. A paper to identify future research challenges was made beyond this in 2007,&lt;ref name="ftn12"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007b), Researching Sustainopreneurship – conditions, concepts, approaches, arenas and questions. An invitation to authentic sustainability business forces. Paper presented at the 13th International Sustainable Development Research Conference, Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 10-12 June, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further with a book chapter published in September 2008.&lt;ref name="ftn13"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2008), Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause. The Promise of Creative Organizing for Sustainability. In "Bridging the Functional and Territorial Views on Regional Entrepreneurship and Development", eds. Bengt Johannisson and Åsa Lindholm-Dahlstrand. Örebro: FSF (Swedish Foundation for Small Business Research). {{ISBN|91-89301-27-7}}. [http://www.fsf.se/publikation/lista/2008_6.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the entrepreneurial discourse has opened up to move beyond a strictly economic phenomenon, rather than being perceived primarily as a social process at large.&lt;ref name="ftn17"&gt;Steyaert, C., Katz, J. (2004) Reclaiming the space of entrepreneurship in society: geographical, discursive and social dimensions, Entrepreneurship and Business Development 2004:3, pp. 179-196, special issue on Social Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding the conceptual formation were two traces of social entrepreneurship and eco-preneurship, dealing primarily with the social and ecological dimensions of sustainability. Primary associations with [[social entrepreneurship]] have also been establishing not-for-profit venturing and charities to innovatively address and solve social problems, whereas [[ecopreneurship]] has been primarily focused on solving environmental problems.&lt;ref name="ftn7"/&gt; See [[Principles of ecopreneurship]].

Both these traces of conceptual development are taken beyond, merge and integrate into the suggested conceptual construct at hand, where distinctions are made from both of these concepts – sustainopreneurial processes taking place institutionally through for-profit organizing, but not with profit as its main driving force. Sustainopreneurial venturing is done in a holistic manner that meets both ecological and social challenges simultaneously with regard to both purpose and process. 

=== Three main dimensions ===

The definition of sustainopreneurship needs to be highlighted by three distinguishing dimensions with all three being simultaneously present in the applied (inter)action it reflects. The first is oriented towards "why" – its purpose and motive. The second and third are reflecting two "how"-related dimensions – its process. 

'''1. Sustainopreneurship consciously sets out to find and/or create innovations to solve sustainability-related problems'''

:The conscious mission that guides the action, especially in the nascent '-preneurial' stage before venturing forms and formalizes into an institutionalized business entity, is to deliberately find practical and innovative solutions to problems related to the sustainability agenda. This is the main key to distinguish this category of entrepreneurial activity and behaviour labelled sustainopreneurship from generic entrepreneurial activity: the cause-oriented intention that places the core motive, purpose and driving-force of the business activities. To identify and further grasp what is meant by sustainability problems, central sources in the global sustainable development discourse are identified, which guide us to what is meant practically and operationally by ''sustainability in action.'' The outcome of diverse sources are summarized in this list of ''"sustainability-related problems",'' determined by the political action plan documented in ''Agenda 21'',&lt;ref name="ftn14"&gt;''UN, Conference on Environment and Development (1992a) Main Documents, download page, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/docs_unced.htm; including Agenda 21, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/index.htm, (accessed 2007-04-16).''&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Millennium Declaration'' defining the ''[[Millennium Development Goals]],&lt;ref name="ftn15"&gt;''UN, Millennium Development Goals (2000) Homepage, http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals, (accessed 2007-04-16).''&lt;/ref&gt; both agreed at the ''Millennium Summit'' in New York 2000, and the ''WSSD Plan of Implementation'' decided upon at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 2002.&lt;ref name="ftn16"&gt;UN, World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002b) Homepage, http://www.johannesburgsummit.org, with WSSD Plan of Implementation, TOC with access to the full document, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm, (accessed 2007-04-16).&lt;/ref&gt; This list, derived and synthesized from these sources, lines up areas with associated problems to solve, goals to reach and values to create:

* [[Poverty]]
* [[Water and sanitation]]
* [[Public health|Health]]
* Education/[[illiteracy]]
* [[Sustainable production]] and consumption patterns
*  [[climate and energy|Climate change and energy systems]]
* Chemicals
* [[Urbanization]]
* Ecosystems, [[biological diversity]] and [[land use]]
* Utilization of sea resources
* Food and agriculture
* [[Trade justice]]
* [[Social stability]], democracy and good governance
* [[Peace]] and security


'''2. Sustainopreneurship means to get solutions to the market through creative organizing''' 

:The line-up above could make one easily depressed. But, a fundamental attitude to acquire and maintain when this list of sustainability-related problems is compiled and then considered is to avoid falling into disempowerment and despair. It is of core importance to take the agenda as entrepreneurial ''challenges'' – to view problems as ''possibilities'', obstacles as ''opportunities'', and resistance as a ''resource'', whatever the nature of the resistance. If the solution is generated by creativity, it is equally important to take it to the market in a creative and innovative way. In this dimension there is nothing that really differs from the generic entrepreneurial description I subscribe to, but this comes natural since sustainopreneurship is a conceptual extension and development from the social phenomenon named entrepreneurship, and thus inherits one of its perceived key dimensions, 'entrepreneurship as creative organizing'.&lt;ref name="ftn19"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005), Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The market is used as well, not society primarily, since it implies business establishment – a sustainability business that still knows its place and role in the holarchy mentioned earlier. Bringing something to the market at the same time brings it to society and our shared physical environment.

'''3. Sustainopreneurship in process adds sustainability value with respect for life support systems '''

:The awareness that the (economic) market is an embedded sub-system in the "socio-sphere" that is in turn a part of the 'bio-sphere' is made explicit. This awareness naturally and self-evidently makes the sustainopreneurial team maximize harmony with life support systems in the process. With joy and pride the epitome of the generic definition of "sustainable development" lives in business venturing. In short – living the generic definition of sustainable development as defined by WCED,&lt;ref name="ftn18"&gt;UN, World Commission on Environment and Development (1987) Our Common Future, Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to the needs of present and future stakeholders, keeping the holistic world-view and making it guide everyday (inter)action. 

===Sustainable vs. sustainability entrepreneurship===
With these dimensions clarified and distinctions made a common conceptual vagueness or lack of clarity needs to be addressed, where a strong need to distinguish clearly between sustainable, vs. ''sustainability'' entrepreneurship is identified. From this point of view, a very important distinction with the concept formed is claimed – ''sustainability'' entrepreneurship as in the concept ''sustainopreneurship; ''the use of entrepreneurial activity in a ''determined action orientation towards solving a sustainability-related problem'' with (creative) business organizing as a ''means'' to solve the problem(s) – '''business with a cause''': to turn business activity from a part of the problem to a part of the solution.'' Sustainable'' entrepreneurship is just a generic entrepreneurial process that takes into consideration the boundaries set by sustainability, and does not address where to and why, the destination, the purpose or the aim of the venture. The strategic intent and the business idea in itself are not related to sustainability ''per se,'' sustainability just being an "attachment" to the entrepreneurial process. The second and third dimensions are represented, but not the first. ''Sustainability'' entrepreneurship, in contrast, takes as its root of existence and strategic aim to solve a sustainability-related problem. This means that all three dimensions are simultaneously present: to take a sustainability innovation to the market through creative organizing with respect for life-supporting systems in the process.

== Future development ==

Given its recent date, there is a need for future research, as mentioned above.&lt;ref name="ftn12"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007b), Researching Sustainopreneurship – conditions, concepts, approaches, arenas and questions. An invitation to authentic sustainability business forces. Paper presented at the 13th International Sustainable Development Research Conference, Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 10-12 June, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn13"/&gt; Main findings here are that conceptually, a deeper analysis is needed to be conducted with a nuanced and detailed taxonomy and framework created of sustainability innovations, the core of sustainopreneurship, primarily by cataloging and categorizing case stories. It is also needed to make a more detailed description to relate sustainopreneurship to other concepts in the wider, general idea-sphere of the "business case of sustainability", in the contemporary plethora of "buzz-words", approaches, methods and acronyms that already exists – and in this context also to motivate why this concept adds value. 

It has been recommended, though, to keep the research applied, to identify obstacles and institutional barriers, and how to overcome them; i. e. facilitating factors for sustainopreneurship, researching prospective tools, enablers and approaches. Appropriate areas and domains for sustainopreneurship applied are recommended to be digested. Research methods recommended are [[Enactive Research]]&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2002) Enacting Entrepreneurship – Using Auto-Ethnography to Study Organization Creation, Paper presented the conference ''Ethnographic Organizational Studies'', University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, September 19-21, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005) Entreprenörskapets väsen, Lund: Studentlitteratur.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Open Space Technology]], since they add instant value among stakeholders, and in themselves naturally builds arenas where sustainopreneurship evolves and proliferates. For progress, beyond these "how"-related pointers, the key is to single out "the big questions", getting answers through collaborative, collective dialogue and conversation, with an explicit interaction and results orientation. Issues and topics have been formulated and outlined, where it is of striking importance with an intention to attract authentic forces potentially hearing this call of exploring the phenomenon further, with the purpose to collapse the degrees of separation in between the stakeholders of the sustainopreneurial concept – in idea, reflective practice and applied interaction to generate collective and collaborative wisdom for a deeper understanding of the concept. An association with this purpose is in its interim stages, ÆREAS(i).

'''TED Conferences LLC''' ('''Technology, Entertainment, Design''') is a media organization that posts talks online for free distribution under the slogan "ideas worth spreading."  TED was conceived by [[Richard Saul Wurman]] in February 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of TED|url=https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/history-of-ted|website=TED: Ideas Worth Spreading.|publisher=TED Conferences LLC|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a conference which has been held annually since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jul/24/observerreview.theobserver?INTCMP=SRCH "What's the big idea?"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. July 24, 2005.

==History==

===1984-99: Founding and early years===
[[File:Bill Clinton talking at TED 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]] addresses TED, 2007]]
TED was conceived in 1984 by architect and graphic designer [[Richard Saul Wurman]], who observed a [[technological convergence|convergence]] of the fields of technology, entertainment, and design (that is, "TED").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tatvasoft world of inspiring people and their ideas |url=https://www.ted.com/profiles/5778538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first conference, organized by Harry Marks and Wurman in the same year, featured demos of the [[compact disc]], co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and one of the first demonstrations of the [[Apple Macintosh]] computer.&lt;ref name="addict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;Cadwalladr, Carole [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr Ted – the ultimate forum for blue-sky thinking] July 4, 2010, [[The Guardian]], Retrieved September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations were given by famous mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and influential members of the [[digerati]] community, like [[Nicholas Negroponte]] and [[Stewart Brand]]. The event was financially unsuccessful; it took six years before the second conference was organized.&lt;ref name="ted.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/16|title=History of TED {{!}} Our Organization {{!}} About {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 onward, a growing community of "TEDsters" gathered annually at the event in California State University Monterey Bay, until 2009, when it was relocated to [[Long Beach, California]] due to a substantial increase in attendees.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Victoria|title=Long Beach to host influential TED conference|date=January 16, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/16/business/fi-ted16|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the speakers had been drawn from the fields of expertise behind the acronym TED, but during the nineties, the roster of presenters broadened to include scientists, philosophers, musicians, religious leaders, philanthropists, and many others.&lt;ref name="ted.com"/&gt;

===2000-16: Recent growth===
[[File:Chris Anderson 2007.jpg|thumb|Curator [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] in 2007]]
In 2000, Wurman, looking for a successor at age 65, met with new-media entrepreneur and TED enthusiast [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] to discuss future happenings. Anderson's UK media company [[Future plc|Future]] bought TED. In November 2001, Anderson's non-profit The [[Sapling Foundation]] (motto: ''"fostering the spread of great ideas."'')&lt;ref name="sapling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/pages/42 |title=About TED: Who we are: Who owns TED |work=TED: Ideas Worth Sharing |publisher=TED Conferences, LLC |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquired TED from Future for £6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/i-was-losing-1-million-a-day-every-day-for-18-months-meet-chris/|title='I was losing $1 million a day, every day for 18 months': Meet Chris Anderson, the man behind TED talks|date=April 29, 2016|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, Anderson gave a TED Talk in which he explained his vision of the conference and his future role of [[curator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/chris_anderson_shares_his_vision_for_ted.html|title=TED's nonprofit transition|last=Anderson|first=Chris|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wurman left after the 2002 conference.

In 2006, attendance cost was $4,400 per person and was by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/invitations|title=Getting Invited (attendees)|work=TED: Ideas Worth Spreading|publisher=TED Conferences, LLC|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools, and conference DVDs. The 2018 conference was $10,000 per attendee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences/ted-conference#h3--ted-conference-standard-membership|title=TED Conference|website=www.ted.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the conference was relocated to Vancouver.

TED is currently funded by a combination of various revenue streams, including conference attendance fees, corporate sponsorships, foundation support, licensing fees, and book sales. Corporate sponsorships are diverse, provided by companies such as [[Google]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[AOL]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], among others. Sponsors do not participate in the creative direction of the event, nor are they allowed to present on the main stage, in the interests of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How TED Works|url=https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/how-ted-works|website=TED.com|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=americanu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ochoa|first1=Rosmari|title=Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED): A case study on how complimentary on- and off-line approaches can build community and cultivate platformsfor innovation and creativity|url=https://www.american.edu/soc/communication/upload/Rosemari-Ochoa.pdf|website=American University School of Communication|publisher=American University|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TED staff consists of about 180 people headquartered in [[New York City]] and [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/who-we-are|title=Who we are - Our organization - About - TED|website=TED.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TED Prize==
The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. Until 2010, it annually granted three individuals $100,000 and a "wish to change the world".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Giussani]].  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruno-giussani/ted-2008-day-2-dave-egger_b_89106.html "Day 2: Dave Eggers and Tutoring, Neil Turok and the next African Einstein, Karen Armstrong and the Charter for Compassion"], ''Huffington Post'', February 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference. Since 2010, in a changed selection process, a single winner is chosen to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts in achieving the winner's wish. In 2012, the prize was not awarded to an individual, but to a concept connected to the current global phenomenon of increasing [[urbanization]]. In 2013, the prize amount was increased to $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tedprize.org/|title=TED Prize {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.tedprize.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TED Prize winners in previous years:

In 2005, Chris Anderson hired [[June Cohen]] as Director of TED Media. In June 2006, after Cohen's idea of a TV show based on TED lectures was rejected by several networks, a selection of talks that had received the highest audience ratings was posted on the websites of TED, [[YouTube]], and [[iTunes]], under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0.&lt;ref name="giving"&gt;{{cite web |title=Giving Away Information, but Increasing Revenue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/technology/16ecom.html |publisher=NYT |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/tedtalksdirector|title=TED|work=YouTube|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only a handful of talks were posted, to test if there was an audience for them. In January of the next year, the number of TED Talks on the site had grown to 44, and they had been viewed more than three million times. On the basis of that success, the organization pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into its video production operations and into the development of a website to showcase about 100 of the talks.&lt;ref name="giving"/&gt;

In April 2007, the new TED.com was launched, developed by design firm Method. In subsequent years, the website has won many prizes, among which seven [[Webby Award]]s, iTunes' "Best Podcast of the Year" (2006-2010), the [[Communication Arts (magazine)|Communication Arts]] Interactive Award for "Information Design" in 2007, the OMMA Award for "video sharing" in 2008, the Web Visionary Award for "technical achievement" in 2008, [[The One Club|The One Show Interactive]] Bronze Award in 2008, the [[AIGA]] Annual Design Competition (2009), and a [[Peabody Award]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bibliotech.stanford.edu/conf11_speakers|title=2011 Speakers {{!}} BiblioTech Program|website=bibliotech.stanford.edu|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://method.com/about/awards|title=Work|website=Method|access-date=June 18, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807060646/http://method.com/about/awards|archivedate=August 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/ted.com|title=TED.com|website=www.peabodyawards.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TED Review|publisher=[[MacWorld]]|url=http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=707209|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Not sure if is exactly the right link.

As of January 2018, over 2600 TED talks had been posted.&lt;ref name="numbertalks"/&gt; Every week 5-7 new talks are published. In January 2009, the then number of videos had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the number of views totaled 500 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/06/27/ted-anniversary/|title=With 500 Million Views, TED Talks Provide Hope for Intelligent Internet Video|last=Kessler|first=Sarah|website=Mashable|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 13, 2012, TED reached its billionth video view.&lt;ref name="billion"/&gt; Chris Anderson in an interview in March 2012:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it's about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as "ideas worth spreading," building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/articles/teds-chris-anderson|title=TED’s Chris Anderson|website=Departures|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2012, [[Netflix]] announced a deal to [[streaming media|stream]] an initial series of 16 two-hour shows, consisting of TED Talks covering similar subjects, from multiple speakers. The content was made available to subscribers in the US, Canada, Latin America, the UK, and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/03/15/netflix-to-stream-ted-talks/|title=Netflix To Stream TED Talks|last=Savitz|first=Eric|website=Forbes|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosted by Jami Floyd, ''[[TED (conference)#TED.com|TED Talks NYC]]'' debuted on [[NYC Media|NYC Life]] on March 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TED TALKS IN NYC –FEATURING WORLD-RENOWNED TALKS FROM TED.COM – PREMIERES ON NYC LIFE |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |accessdate=January 17, 2012 |newspaper=.nyc.gov |date=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103151258/http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEDGlobal===
In 2005, under Anderson's supervision, a more internationally oriented sister conference was added, under the name TEDGlobal. It was held, in chronological order: in [[Oxford]], [[UK]] (2005), in [[Arusha]], Tanzania (2007, titled TEDAfrica), in Oxford again (2009 and 2010), and in [[Edinburgh]], UK (2011, 2012, and 2013). In 2014, it was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/ted_conferences_about_past_teds_v2|title=Past TEDs {{!}} Conferences {{!}} About {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was TED India, in [[Mysore]] (2009) and TEDGlobal London in [[London]] (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/tedgloballondon_programbrochure.pdf|title=TEDGlobal&gt;London Tuesday 16 June 2015|website=tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com|access-date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEDGlobal 2017 was held again in Arusha, Tanzania and it was curated and hosted by Emeka Okafor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ted-global-2017-arusha-tanzania|title=Ten years on, TEDGlobal is tackling Africa's education crisis|last=Christian|first=Bonnie|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED Translators (formerly The Open Translation Project (OTP))===
TED Translators started as TED Open Translation Project in May 2009 and aims to "[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English", according to TED Curator Chris Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/OpenTranslationProject|title=TED Open Translation Project|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OTP utilizes crowd-based subtitling platforms to translate the text of TED and TED-Ed videos, as well as to caption and translate videos created in the TEDx program (with its technology partner [[dotSUB]] until May 2012, and then with [[open source]] translation tool [[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]]). At the time of the launch, 300 translations had been done by 200 volunteer transcribers in 40 languages.&lt;ref name="TED"/&gt; In May 2015, over 70,000 sets of subtitles in 107 languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/participate/translate/otp-2014-annual-report|title=2014 annual report: TED Open Translation Project {{!}} Translate {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been completed by (an all-time total of) 38,173 volunteer translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amara.org/en/teams/ted/|title=Dashboard - TED {{!}} Amara|website=www.amara.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project contributed to a significant increase in international visitors to TED's website, with traffic from outside the US growing 350 percent, 600 percent growth in Asia, and more than 1000 percent in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/at-1-year-anniversary-teds-open-translation-project-celebrates-more-than-7000-completed-translations-from-4000-volunteers-in-75-languages-93683249.html|title=At 1-Year Anniversary, TED's Open Translation Project Celebrates More Than 7,000 Completed Translations From 4,000 Volunteers in 75 Languages|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEDx===
{{See also|List of TEDx conferences}}
TEDx are independent TED-like events, which can be organized by anyone who obtains a free license from TED, agreeing to follow certain principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/fashion/26TEDX.html|title=A Conference Makes Learning Free (and Sexy)|last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|date=September 24, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEDx events are non-profit but may use an admission fee or commercial sponsorship to cover costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/493#general-rules|title=TEDx Rules {{!}} Before you start {{!}} Organize a local TEDx event {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, speakers are not paid. They must also relinquish the copyrights to their materials, which TED may edit and distribute under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mypages.iit.edu/~tedxiit/|title=TEDxIIT|website=mypages.iit.edu|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TEDx event is organized by volunteers from the local community, and just like TED events, it lacks any commercial, religious, or political agenda. Its goal is to spark conversation, connection, and community.

As of January 2014, the TEDxTalks library contained some 30,000 films and presentations from over 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/|title=TED {{!}} TEDx Events {{!}} TEDxTalks|website=tedxtalks.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/06/19/heres-why-ted-and-tedx-are-so-incredibly-appealing-infographic/2/|title=Here's Why TED and TEDx are So Incredibly Appealing (infographic)|author=Mark Fidelman|date=June 19, 2012|work=Forbes|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, the TEDx archive surpassed 100,000 talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ted.com/achievement-unlocked-tedx-celebrates-100000-talks/|title=Achievement unlocked: TEDx celebrates 100,000 talks!|date=October 19, 2017|work=TED Blog|access-date=October 30, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, eight TEDx events were organised every day; raised up from five in June 2012, the previous year, in 133 countries.&lt;ref name="listen"&gt;Heller, Nathan [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/09/120709fa_fact_heller ''Listen and Learn''], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', July 9, 2012.

===TED Fellows===
[[File:TEDGlobal2012.jpg|thumb|TEDGlobal 2012 at the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]]]]
TED Fellows were introduced in 2007, during the first TEDAfrica conference in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], where 100 young people were selected from across the continent. Two years later, during TEDIndia, 99 Fellows were recruited, mainly from South Asia. In 2009, the Fellows program was initiated in its present form. For every TED or TEDGlobal conference, 20 Fellows are selected; a total of 40 new Fellows a year. Each year, 20 past Fellows are chosen to participate in the two-year Senior Fellows program (in which they will attend four more conferences).

Acceptance as a Fellow is not based on academic [[credential]]s, but mainly on past and current actions, and plans for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/248|title=Application tips {{!}} Apply to be a TED Fellow {{!}} TED Fellows Program {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides attending a conference free of charge, each Fellow takes part in a special program with [[mentorship|mentoring]] by experts in the field of spreading ideas, and he or she can give a short talk on the "TED Fellows" stage. Some of these talks are subsequently published on TED.com. Senior Fellows have additional benefits and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|title=Wired meets 2011's TED Fellows|last=Rowan|first=David|date=July 18, 2011|website=Wired|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175312/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|archive-date=July 20, 2011|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED-Ed===
TED-Ed is a category of TED talks which are short animated lessons aimed at children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ed.ted.com/about|title=Lessons Worth Sharing|website=TED-Ed|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates explanatory animation videos on various concepts. TED-Ed lessons are created in collaboration with educators and animators. Current advisers for Ted-Ed lessons include [[Aaron Sams]], Jackie Bezos, John Hunter, [[Jonathan Bergmann]], [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Sir Ken Robinson]], [[Melinda Gates|Melinda French Gates]], and [[Sal Khan|Salman Khan]].

===TEDMED===
{{Main|TEDMED}}

[[TEDMED]] is an annual conference concerned with health and medicine. It is an independent event operating under license from the nonprofit TED conference.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/tedmed_a_new_pa/|title=TEDMED: a new partnership|date=January 19, 2010|website=TED Blog|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEDMED was founded in 1998 by TED's founder Ricky Wurman. After years of inactivity, in 2008 Wurman sold TEDMED to entrepreneur [[Marc Hodosh]], who recreated and relaunched it. The first event under Hodosh's ownership was held in San Diego in October 2009. In January 2010, TED.com began including videos of TEDMED talks on the TED website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second Hodosh-owned edition of TEDMED took place in October 2010, also in San Diego.  It sold out for a second year and attracted notable healthcare leaders and Hollywood celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDMED|title=Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne with Nathaniel Pearson at TEDMED 2010|date=December 8, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX0culYjU_A|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Jay S. Walker|Jay Walker]] and a group of executives and investors purchased TEDMED from Hodosh for $16 million with future additional payments of as much as $9 million. The conference was then moved to Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

He said that it is unacceptable that TED, which is a non-profit organization, charges attendees $6,000 but cannot afford to pay anything to their speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/futures-exchange/why-im-not-a-tedx-speaker-3be652b8eccb|title=Why I'm Not a TEDx Speaker|last=Swain|first=Frank|date=November 8, 2013|website=Medium|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers at the independently-organized TEDx talks may not be paid; speakers at the official, yearly, TED Conference are compensated for their talks.

[[Sarah Lacy]] of ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' and ''[[TechCrunch]]'' wrote in 2010 that TED attendees complained of elitism from a "hierarchy of parties throughout the LA-area with strict lists and security" after the sessions. She gave TED credit for making talks free online or live streamed.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/09/ted-now-with-more-elitism/|title=TED: Now with More Elitism?|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED Talk content===
Disagreements have also occurred between TED speakers and organizers. In her 2010 TED Talk, comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] referred to adopting a "retarded" child. TED organizer [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] objected via his [[Twitter]] account, leading to a Twitter skirmish between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/14/ted-organizer-trashes-speaker-fails-social-iq-test/|title=TED Organizer Trashes Speaker, Fails Social IQ Test|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/the-ted-v-sarah-silverman-fight-turns-really-retarded/|title=The TED v. Sarah Silverman Fight Turns Really Retarded|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, noted statistician [[Nassim Taleb]] called TED a "monstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers." He claimed TED curators did not initially post his talk "warning about the financial crisis" on their site on purely cosmetic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taleb|first=Nassim|year=2010|title=The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a New Section: 'On Robustness and Fragility'|publisher=Random House Trade|page=336|isbn=0-8129-7381-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Hanauer]] spoke at TED University, challenging the popular belief that top income earners in America are the engines of job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/here-is-the-full-inequality-speech-and-slideshow-that-was-too-hot-for-ted/257323/|title=Here Is the Full Inequality Speech and Slideshow That Was Too Hot for TED|author=National Journal|date=May 17, 2012|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TED was accused of censoring the talk by not posting it on the website.&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/342291/20120517/ted-censors-nick-hanauer-talk-income-inequality.htm|title=TED Censors Seattle Multimillionaire Nick Hanauer?s Talk On Income Inequality, Taxing The Rich|date=May 17, 2012|work=International Business Times|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/features/restoration-calls/too-hot-for-ted-income-inequality-20120516|title=Too Hot for TED: Income Inequality|work=www.nationaljournal.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[National Journal]]'' reported Chris Anderson had reacted by saying the talk probably ranked as one of the most politically controversial talks they had ever run, and they needed to be careful about when they posted it.&lt;ref name=IBT/&gt; Anderson officially responded, indicating that TED only posts one talk every day, selected from many.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tedchris.posterous.com/131417405|title=Good night, Posterous|website=tedchris.posterous.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' staff writer Bruce Upbin described Hanauer's talk as "shoddy and dumb"&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Upbin. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/05/17/the-real-reason-that-ted-talk-was-censored-its-shoddy-and-dumb/ The Real Reason That TED Talk Was 'Censored'? It's Shoddy And Dumb], ''Forbes'', May 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine condemned the conference's move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/all/approvalmatrix/approval-matrix-2012-5-28/|title=The Approval Matrix|date=May 28, 2012|publisher=New York magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a TEDx talk by [[Rupert Sheldrake]], TED issued a statement saying their scientific advisors believed that "there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake's more radical claims" made in the talk and recommended that it "should not be distributed without being framed with caution". The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors. The move and framing prompted accusations of censorship, to which TED responded by saying the accusations were "simply not true" and that Sheldrake's talk was "up on our website".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/19/the-debate-about-rupert-sheldrakes-talk/ |title=The debate about Rupert Sheldrake's talk |publisher=TED |date=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bignell, Paul |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ted-conference-censorship-row-8563105.html |title=TED conference censorship row |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TED has also been accused of censoring a presentation by [[Graham Hancock]] in which he discussed the effects of legal versus illegal drugs, by removing it from YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/04/11/ted-bans-graham-hancocks-talk-on-consciousness/|title=Banned TED Talk: Graham Hancock – The War on Consciousness|publisher=|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor [[Benjamin H. Bratton|Benjamin Bratton]] at [[University of California, San Diego]], TED Talks' efforts at fostering progress in socio-economics, science, philosophy, and technology have been ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/30/we-need-to-talk-about-ted "We need to talk about TED"], Prof. Benjamin Bratton, ''The Guardian'', December 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Anderson responded that some critics have a misconception of TED's goals, and failed to recognise that TED aimed to instill excitement in the audience in the same way the speaker felt it. He stated that TED only wishes to bring news of the significance of certain topics to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/ted-not-civilisational-disaster-but-wikipedia "TED is not a recipe for civilisational disaster"], Chris Anderson, ''The Guardian'', January 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">'''Tapered integration''' is a term from [[theory of the firm|organization theory]] that refers to a mix of [[vertical integration]] and market exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Besanko, D., Dranove, D., Shanley, M., Schaefer, S. (2013). ''[[Economics of Strategy]]''. 6th edition, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Upstream, a producer might manufacture some of the input itself and buy the remaining portion from independent firms. Downstream, the manufacturer might sell a portion of its output through an in-house sales force and use independent sales forces to sell the remainder.

It is not documented when the term ''tapered integration'' was first used, though it can be found in law journals such as the [[Yale Law Journal]] as early as the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, F., Stern, R. H. (1959). Competition, Contract, and Vertical Integration. ''The Yale Law Journal'', 69(1), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; the first known use in academia being a case study by William King Norris.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, W. K. (1954). ''A Case Study in Forward Tapered Integration''. University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples==
Examples for tapered integration are (1) [[Tim Hortons]] owning some of its retail outlets but also using franchising, (2) [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] both having integrated bottling subsidiaries while also relying on independent bottlers for production and distribution in some markets, or (3) [[BMW]] which uses both in-house market research from its Corporate Center Development and external market research from independent, specialized firms.&lt;ref&gt;Besanko, D., Dranove, D., Shanley, M., Schaefer, S. (2013). ''Economics of Strategy''. 6th edition, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages/Disadvantages==
=== Advantages===
* Expansion of input channels without significant capital outlays
* Use of internal cost information to negotiate contracts with market firms
* Motivation tool for both internal division and market firms
* Protection against [[hold-up problem|holdup]] risk&lt;ref&gt;Porter, M. E. (1998). ''Competitive strategy: Techniques for analyzing competitors and industries''. 2nd edition, New Jork: The Free Press, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages===
* Both internal and external production may stay below minimum eff. scale
* coordination and monitoring problems
* Inefficient internal divisions may be kept when not efficient

The '''World Programming System''', also known as '''WPS Analytics''' or '''WPS''', is a software product developed by a company called [[World Programming]]. WPS allows users to create, edit and run [[computer programs|programs]] written in the [[SAS language|language of SAS]].&lt;ref name="World Programming System (WPS) – What is WPS?"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/overview|title=World Programming System (WPS) – What is WPS?|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was the subject of [[SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd|a lawsuit by SAS Institute]]. The [[European Court of Justice|EU Court of Justice]] ruled in favor of World Programming, stating that the copyright protection does not extend to the software functionality, the programming language used and the format of the data files used by the program. It stated that there is no copyright infringement when a company which does not have access to the source code of a program studies, observes and tests that program to create another program with the same functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-02/copyright-can-t-block-software-reverse-engineering-court.html|title=Copyright Can't Block Software Reverse Engineering: Court|last=White|first=Aoife|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==

WPS can use programs written in the [[SAS language|language of SAS]] without the need for translating them into any other language. In this regard WPS is compatible with the SAS system. WPS is a language interpreter able to process the language of SAS and produce similar results.&lt;ref name="Your Apps – Language Support"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/your-apps/language-support|title=Your Apps – Language Support|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WPS is available to run on [[z/OS|Mainframe z/OS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], Linux for Arm8 64-bit ([[AArch64]]), [[PowerLinux]], POWER/System p/pSeries (LE), [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]] and [[Linux on zSeries|Linux on Mainframe System z]].&lt;ref name="Platforms – Summary"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/platforms|title=Platforms – Summary|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On all supported platforms, programs written in the language of SAS can be executed from a WPS command line interface, often referred to as running in batch mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/modules/interface/cli|title=Interface Module – WPS CLI|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WPS can also be used from a [[graphical user interface]] known as the '''WPS Workbench''' for managing, editing and running programs written in the language of SAS. The WPS Workbench user interface is based on [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].&lt;ref name="Interface Module – WPS Workbench"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/modules/interface/workbench|title=Interface Module – WPS Workbench|accessdate=19 December 2016|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WPS version 4 (released in March 2018) introduced a drag-and-drop workflow canvas providing interactive blocks for data retrieval, blending and preparation, data discovery and profiling, predictive modelling powered by machine learning algorithms, model performance validation and scorecards.

WPS version 3 (released in February 2012) provides a new client/server architecture that allows the WPS Workbench GUI to execute SAS programs on remote server installations of WPS in a network or cloud. The resulting output, data sets, logs, etc., can then all be viewed and manipulated from inside the Workbench as if the workloads had been executed locally. SAS programs do not require any special language statements to use this feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/modules/interface/link|title=Interface Module – WPS Link|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 World Programming defended its use of the language of SAS in the High Court of England and Wales in ''[[SAS Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/1829.html|title=SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd|accessdate=3 February 2012|date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
