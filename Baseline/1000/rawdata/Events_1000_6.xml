Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or [[spiritual transformation]], and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt; Others suggested that the date marked the [[End time|end of the world]] or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], an interaction between [[Earth]] and the [[Sagittarius A*|black hole at the center of the galaxy]],&lt;ref name="NASA1" /&gt; or [[Nibiru cataclysm|Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru]].

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name="Brown 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI do not ♥ pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA2" /&gt;

== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],&lt;ref name="delara2006" /&gt; it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Population structure of the classic period Maya" /&gt; The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt; meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|European conquest]].

Unlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}&lt;ref name="The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0" /&gt;

=== Apocalypse ===
[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]

There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429–430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's "zero date"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}&lt;ref name=yucalandia/&gt; This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."&lt;ref name="makemson1957" /&gt; In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that "there is a suggestion&amp;nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus&amp;nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}

=== Objections ===
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="carrasco1990" /&gt; In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; it did not mark the end of the calendar.&lt;ref name="milbrath1999" /&gt; "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; "There will be another cycle," said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this."&lt;ref name="The Sky Is Not Falling" /&gt; Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xultún]], one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&amp;nbsp;– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."&lt;ref name="NG120510" /&gt;

Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.&lt;ref name="prensalibre" /&gt;

=== Prior associations ===
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profecías]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hoopes 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst Förstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann 1906: 264&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1915: 32&lt;/ref&gt; who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&amp;nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Maya references to b'ak'tun 13 ==
It is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.

=== Tortuguero ===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

&lt;div style="width: 500px"&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
: ''tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik''
: ''chan ajaw u:x uni:w''
: ''uhto:m il[?]''
: ''ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'''
: ''ta chak joyaj''
{{col-2}}
: It will be completed the 13th ''b'ak'tun''.
: It is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K'ank'in''
: and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].
: It is the display of ''B'olon-Yokte'''
: in a great "investiture".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}
{{col-end}}
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of B'olon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]

Very little is known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.&lt;ref name="eberl2005" /&gt; He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.&lt;ref name="hieroglyphic" /&gt;

Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36–37}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.&lt;ref name="What Will Not Happen in 2012" /&gt;

=== La Corona ===
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13 ===
Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&amp;nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&amp;nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&amp;nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}

Another example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;×13×360 days,&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt; or roughly 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Maya Creation Myths and Cosmography|author=Wagner, Elizabeth|editor=Grube, Nikolai|title=Maya: Divine Kings of the Rainforest|page=283|year=2000|publisher=Konemann|isbn=978-3-8290-4150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=49}}

In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in [[Xultún]], Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.&lt;ref name="NG120510"&gt;{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Eric | title = Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth |work=National Geographic |date=10 May 2012 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/ |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saturno et al. 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 11 May 2012 | volume = 336 | issue = 6082 | pages = 714–717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1221444 | title = Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala |author1=William A.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}

=== Origins ===
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],&lt;ref name="particular" /&gt; while both [[José Argüelles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')&lt;ref name="elles1975" /&gt; and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mckenna1993" /&gt; discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.

In 1983, with the publication of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,''{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.&lt;ref name="Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elles1987" /&gt; He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17–27}}

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The End of the World As They Know It" /&gt; Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&amp;nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt;

=== Galactic alignment ===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref name="Hoopes2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoopes2012" /&gt; Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".

==== Precession ====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115–127}}

Similarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center" /&gt; Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.&lt;ref name="What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?" /&gt; In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;

==== Mysticism ====
[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]

Mystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975). 

Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or "Black Road".&lt;ref name="Xibalba or Xibalbe" /&gt; John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.&lt;ref name="The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" /&gt; New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.&lt;ref name="pinchbeck2006" /&gt; Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].&lt;ref name="jenkins1998" /&gt; Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}

==== Criticism ====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.&lt;ref name="jenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Alignment Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus1997" /&gt;

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,&lt;ref name="grofe2011" /&gt; Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref name="jenkins2009" /&gt; have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices,{{refn|{{harvnb|Aveni|2009|pp=54–55}}, citing {{harvnb|Aveni|Hartung|2000}}.}} but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=57}}

=== Timewave zero and the ''I Ching'' ===
{{Main|Terence McKenna#Novelty theory and Timewave Zero}}
[[File:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the "Timewave Zero" software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt; [[Terence McKenna]] claimed that the universe has a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt; The [[scientific community]] considers novelty theory to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=A. |year=2009 |title=2012: Science Or Superstition (the Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon) |publisher=The Disinformation Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-rVUCO4YyYC&amp;pg=PA261|isbn=978-1-934708-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=normark&gt;{{cite web |title=2012: Prophet of nonsense #8: Terence McKenna – Novelty theory and timewave zero |last=Normark |first=Johan |url=http://haecceities.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/2012-prophet-of-nonsense-8-terence-mckenna%E2%80%93-novelty-theory-and-timewave-zero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'', an ancient Chinese book on [[divination]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;

The 1975 first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} of 21 December 2012 throughout.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt;

Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Smith II D.

The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of [[human civilization]], became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the [[Internet]], particularly on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; [[The Discovery Channel]] was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment".&lt;ref name="PressSunBulletin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121210/NEWS01/312110007/Cornell-Maya-expert-World-probably-won-t-end-Dec-21?odyssey=nav%7Chead|title=Cornell Maya expert: World probably won't end Dec. 21 |last=D.W.

=== Other alignments ===
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), creating havoc on Earth.&lt;ref name="krupp" /&gt; Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 [[light year]]s from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.&lt;ref name="Questions answered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What would happen if a supermassive black hole came close to the Earth?" /&gt; This reading of the alignment was included on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Decoding the Past''. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45&amp;nbsp;minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".&lt;ref name="How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" /&gt;

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; According to the [[Shiva Hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.&lt;ref name="Perturbing the Oort Cloud" /&gt; However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.&lt;ref name="Galactic Plane" /&gt; Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.&lt;ref name="The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane" /&gt;

A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.&lt;ref name="Planetary Alignment" /&gt; [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above ≈300&amp;nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]], the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Plait-alignment" /&gt;

=== Geomagnetic reversal ===
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="2012: No Killer Solar Flare" /&gt; This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] was weakening,&lt;ref name="Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core" /&gt; which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]], and the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], which was expected sometime around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storm Warning|publisher=NASA|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/10mar_stormwarning/|year=2006|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete,&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Merrill | first1 = Ronald T. | last2 = McElhinny | first2 = Michael W. | last3 = McFadden | first3 = Philip L. | title = The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year = 1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not start on any particular date.&lt;ref name="Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of [[sunspots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Maximum: Three Solar Flares And A Coronal Mass Ejection As The Sun Reaches Peak Solar Activity|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/solar-maximum-three-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejection-sun-reaches-peak-solar-activity-1442608|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.&lt;ref name="2012: No Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.&lt;ref name="goemag" /&gt; David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer [[Michio Kaku]], who claimed in an interview with [[Fox News]] that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt;

=== Planet X/Nibiru ===
{{main|Nibiru cataclysm}}

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet&amp;nbsp;X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; The idea originated from claims of channeling [[grey aliens|alien beings]] and is widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;{{sfn|Schilling|2008|p=111}} Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

=== Other catastrophes ===
[[File:Pleiades large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pleiades]], a [[star cluster]] with supposed influence sometimes tied to the 2012 event|alt=The Pleiades star cluster]]

Author [[Graham Hancock]], in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''{{sfn|Coe|1992|pp=275–276}} as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.&lt;ref name="hancock" /&gt; Filmmaker [[Roland Emmerich]] later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 [[disaster film]] ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagoscifi credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf | title = 2012 (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Credit List |accessdate=25 November 2009 |publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.&lt;ref name="'Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse" /&gt;

The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.&lt;ref name="Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?" /&gt;

Some media outlets tied the fact that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] would undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Connelly 19 January 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |title=Tatooine's twin suns&amp;nbsp;– coming to a planet near you just as soon as Betelgeuse explodes |last=Connelly |first=Claire |work=News.com.au |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922083805/http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Betelgeuse and 2012" /&gt; To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth.&lt;ref name="Is Betelgeuse about to blow?" /&gt; In December 2011, NASA's [[Francis Reddy]] issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.&lt;ref name="Reddy 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012: Fear No Supernova | publisher = NASA | last = Reddy | first = Francis | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-supernova.html | year = 2011 | accessdate = 23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim involved [[alien invasion]]. In December 2010, an article, first published in [[examiner.com]] and later referenced in the English-language edition of ''[[Pravda]]''&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt; claimed, citing a Second [[Digitized Sky Survey]] photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; Astronomer and debunker [[Phil Plait]] noted that by using the [[small-angle formula]], one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; In January 2011, [[Seth Shostak]], chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army.&lt;ref name="For End of the World, a French Peak Holds Allure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel 2010" /&gt; "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told ''[[The Independent]]'' in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for [[UFO]]s]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal."&lt;ref name=hippies /&gt; In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Doomsday: French Police Block Access to Survivors' Refuge Pic de Bugarach|author=Hanna Osborne|publisher=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129090241/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event".

== Cultural influence ==
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.

The [[UFO conspiracy]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the [[Mayan calendar]] "stopping" on this date.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; The [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005–2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2009), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Armageddon series" /&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]], [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012.&lt;ref name="2012 Apocalypse" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] launched a show called ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]'', a documentary series about [[survivalism|survivalists]] preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic Doomsday Preppers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Doomsday Preppers | work = National Geographic | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of books were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; The bestselling book of 2009,&lt;ref name="Best-Selling Books of 2009" /&gt; [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the [[Julian date]] for 21 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of The Lost Symbol|author1=Dan Bernstein |author2=Arne de Kiuzer |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qgqfqUjF_38C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=2456282.5+julian+date+%22lost+symbol%22|accessdate=19 December 2012|isbn=978-0-297-86060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, the 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic.&lt;ref name="sony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Relax, the end isn't nigh" /&gt; Although the campaign was heavily criticized,&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="2009 Worldwide Grosses" /&gt; An article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building "survival arks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China fears end of the world is nigh|author=Malcolm Moore|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9729270/China-fears-end-of-the-world-is-nigh.html| accessdate=11 December 2012|location=London|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Sunny Kirsten Dunst is picture perfect at the Cannes photocall for her provocative new film Melancholia" /&gt; Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of [[Magnolia Pictures]] said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".&lt;ref name="Magnolia Picks Up North American Rights to Lars von Trier's 'Melancholia'" /&gt;

The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "[[A Certain Shade of Green]]" by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "[[2012 (It Ain't the End)]]" (2010) performed by [[Jay Sean]] and "[[Till the World Ends]]" (2011) performed by [[Britney Spears]]. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet [[hoax]] related to South Korean singer [[Psy]] being one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's "[[Gangnam Style]]" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |title=Much ado about apocalypse |first=Chok |last=Suat Ling |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104174754/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian composer [[A.

A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at [[Boston University]], questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Vanessa |title=Brands Capitalize on 'Impending Apocalypse' |publisher=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-19/brands-capitalizing-on-the-impending-apocalypse|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
* {{note label|A|a|a}} The [[13 (number)|number 13]] plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}&lt;ref name="The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya" /&gt;
* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt;
* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than "0.0.0.0.0", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as "13.0.0.0.0"&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;
* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at 21 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Who's Who in the Maya World" /&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;
* {{note label|E|e|e}} Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011". He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,{{sfn|Coe|1980|p=151}} not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Coe|1984}}. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book.}} The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book ''The Ancient Maya'' {{harv|Morley|1983|p=603|loc=Table B2}}.

The '''999 phone charging myth''' is an [[urban myth]] which claims that if a [[mobile phone]] has low battery then dialing [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] (or any regional [[emergency number]]) charges the phone so it has more power. This was confirmed as a myth by several British police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls.

== Basis ==
The basis for the myth was a feature of [[BlackBerry]] phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone automatically locked down phone features and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Accident-proneness''', also known as '''clumsiness''', is the idea that some people have a greater predisposition than others to suffer [[accident]]s, such as [[car crash]]es and [[industrial injuries]]. It may be used as a reason to deny any [[insurance]] on such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how-insurance-companies-measure-risk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. ''Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee'', Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Present study ==

The subject is still being studied actively.  Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in [[safety engineering]], where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.
One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Statistical evidence ===

Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Doubt ===

However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a ''distinct, persistent and independently verifiable'' physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Nature and causes ===

The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown.  Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included [[absent-mindedness]], [[wikt:clumsiness|clumsiness]], [[carelessness]], [[impulsivity]], predisposition to [[risk]]-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.
Broad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc |title=創造性ﾃｽﾄ、薬不要の風邪治療(妊婦､ｱｽﾘｰﾄ､NSAID)、適性ﾃｽﾄ |publisher=F6.dion.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000135/http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breaking news''', interchangeably termed '''late-breaking news''' and also known as a '''special report''' or '''special coverage''' or '''news bulletin''', is a [[news|current issue]] that broadcasters feel warrants the interruption of scheduled programming and/or current news in order to report its details. Its use is also assigned to the most significant story of the moment or a story that is being covered live. It could be a story that is simply of wide interest to viewers and has little impact otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Always Free Online|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/breaking-news|author=Christopher Merrill|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|date=January 20, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Breaking News –  Journalism Terms|url=http://journalism.about.com/od/journalismglossary/g/breakingnews.htm|publisher=Journalism.about.com|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many times, breaking news is used after the news organization has already reported on the story. When a story has not been reported on previously, the graphic and phrase "Just In" is sometimes used instead.

==Formats==
===Television===
The format of a ''special report'' or ''breaking news'' event on television commonly consists of the current non-news programming (or, in some cases, regularly scheduled newscasts) suddenly switching to a reverse countdown, usually from 5 seconds, to allow any [[Network affiliate|affiliated stations]] to switch to the network news feed (television stations typically do not provide these countdowns for local coverage, normally leading with a graphic and/or voiceover announcing the cut-in). If a national network newscast is in progress when the breaking news event occurs, the newscast will pause temporarily to allow other network affiliates to join the network news feed.
There is then an opening graphic, featuring music (such as [[NBC]]'s "[[The Mission (theme music)|The Pulse of Events]]", composed by [[John Williams]]) which adds an emphasis on the importance of the event. This is usually followed by the introduction of a [[news anchor]], who welcomes the viewer to the broadcast and introduces the story at hand. [[Lower thirds]] and other graphics may also be altered to convey a sense of urgency. 

Once the story is introduced, the network or local station may, if possible, choose to continue to show a live shot of the anchor or may cut away to video or images of the story that is being followed during the broadcast. Additionally, the coverage may be passed to a [[reporter]] at the location of the breaking event, possibly sharing more information about the story as it breaks.

Depending upon the story being followed, the report may last only a few minutes, or continue for multiple hours – or with the longest uninterrupted news events, four days – at a time (events in which the latter instances has occurred include the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and the [[September 11 attacks]], which took place between November 22–26, 1963 and September 11–15, 2001, respectively). If coverage continues for an extended amount of time, the network may integrate analysis about the story through analysts in-studio, via phone, [[communications satellite|satellite]], [[broadband]] (B-GAN) or through other means of communication. Depending on the severity of the event, regular [[television commercial|commercial advertising]] may be completely suspended for sustained coverage, and network affiliates will be required to insert their [[station identification]] in at the top of the hour overlaid during the report rather than through the usual means of a station imaging promo or program reminder. 

If a story occurs during the [[Dayparting|Early Fringe]] timeslot and depending on the magnitude of the events at hand, local stations might be given the opportunity to break away from the network feed and begin their evening newscasts. This is set up by a cue from the network's talent that they will pause for a few seconds to reset coverage, at which point an opening graphic may be rolled again. Information is also disseminated from an internal alert service utilized by a station's [[master control]]. After the local newscast, stations will likely return to the network's feed as they normally would for the nightly news, but they may be joining in on an "extended edition". Whether or not a station will take over for local news is usually the choice of that station's [[news director]].

When the coverage comes to a close, the network or station may either resume programming that was occurring prior to the event or begin new programming (if the breaking news occurs during a newscast the network will switch back to the newscast upon completion if time permits), depending upon the amount of time spent on the coverage. The anchor will usually remind viewers to check the network's website (or that of the station, if coverage is provided locally), or watch any [[United States cable news|cable news]] channels that may be co-owned with the network for more information. If the story breaks during daytime programming, the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be or might be more details on their local news that day and a full wrap-up on the network's evening news program. Usually, regular daytime programming is re-joined in progress and segments may be missed.

If the event occurs during [[prime time]], the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be more details on their late local newscast and on the network's [[breakfast television|overnight news program]] (if applicable) the next morning. Programming at this time is either joined in progress or started back up at the point of the interruption, depending on whether the program is new to air, highly rated or has time left in its time slot to finish airing (for instance, [[ABC News (United States)|ABC]]'s breaking news report involving the April 2017 [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|Shayrat missile strike]] took into account a new episode of the popular series ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'', where the show was resumed right at the point of interruption twice for those reports; [[NBC]]'s coverage featured the low-rated ''[[The Blacklist: Redemption]]'' joined in the middle of an episode in progress after their special report without any of that consideration). In either of the above instances, network (and in some cases, for local stations, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]]) programs that have segments not aired or are pre-empted in their entirety by breaking news reports – particularly those that extend to or longer than 20 or 45 minutes, depending on the length of the previously scheduled program – may have to be rescheduled to air at a later time. 

Some events, like [[State of the Union address]]es and [[United States presidential debates|presidential debates]], are scheduled to start at the top of the hour during prime time. Under those circumstances, regularly scheduled network programming is preempted for the entire duration of the event. If there is sufficient time (generally 60 minutes or more) remaining in prime time, the network may broadcast its next regularly scheduled program in its entirety or join regularly scheduled programming in progress. However, if there is insufficient time remaining for any prime-time programs, the special report will continue until the network affiliates begin airing their late local newscasts.

In the United States, on days when [[United States presidential elections|presidential elections]] take place, regularly scheduled prime-time programming is suspended so that networks can air up-to-the-minute coverage of the elections. Likewise, regularly scheduled daytime programs are suspended during coverage of [[United States presidential inaugurations|presidential inaugurations]]. However, during those types of events, regular commercial advertising is shown. Similar procedures are enacted for elections or political inaugurations that take place in other countries.

===Radio===
On radio, the process of a breaking news story is somewhat the same, though some different considerations are made for the medium. For instance, a breaking news theme is required by default to have an urgent tenor and be used only for the purpose of true breaking news or bulletins. This is obvious on the local [[all-news radio]] stations owned by [[Entercom]] (formerly owned by [[CBS Radio]]), which very rarely use a breaking news theme for all but the most urgent and dire of breaking news, and is purposefully structured to give a sense of attention for the listener, almost sounding like an alarm. For local events, continuous coverage may be imposed, or else the station may wait until they have a reporter at the scene and will promise more details of the event as they become available.

National news that is broadcast over a [[radio network]] requires constant monitoring by station employees to allow the network coverage to air, although many stations will take the 'urgent' signal sent by the network and break into programming immediately. Again, continuous coverage from a national radio network depends on the severity of the event, and often the network may just pass down the coverage by their local affiliate with spare commentary by the network's anchors.

Other considerations are made also; FM music stations rarely relay breaking news unless it is an event of grave national concern, though local weather warnings are relayed when in effect (either in the form of updates provided by an on-staff anchor or [[disc jockey]], an emergency alert system or through an audio simulcast of a television station which maintains a contractual partnership with a radio outlet). Less urgent events allow a network to feed updates to stations at 20, 30 and 50 minutes after the hour to give a summary of events. Stations are also careful about what stories are relayed during play-by-play broadcasts of professional and college sports, as those are the programs most listened to on radio, so breaking news coverage is limited to only commercial breaks.

==Usage==
News bulletins have been a fixture of radio broadcasting since at least the 1920s. Examples of early news bulletins in the [[Golden Age of Radio]] include fictionalized versions in the 1938 radio drama ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and coverage of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], which was also the first television news bulletin, reported on stations in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles is credited with being the first television station to provide extended coverage of a breaking news event: for 27½ hours from April 8 to 9, 1949, the station carried live coverage of an attempt to rescue three-year-old [[Kathy Fiscus]], who had fallen down an abandoned well in [[San Marino, California]], where she ultimately perished due to [[asphyxia]] from a lack of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Kathy Fiscus Story: Turning Point in TV News|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-kathy-fiscus-story-19890408-story.html|author=[[Stan Chambers]]|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 8, 1989|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Angeles Television News Pioneer Stan Chambers Dies at 91|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/los-angeles-television-news-pioneer-stan-chambers-dies-28953145|website=[[ABC News]]|date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades before 24-hour news networks such as [[CNN]] began to exist, programming interruptions were restricted to extremely urgent news, such as the death of an important political figure. For example, one of the earliest such interruptions that modern viewers would recognize as "breaking news" coverage was for the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, (with [[CBS News]] anchorman [[Walter Cronkite]]'s [[Walter Cronkite#Kennedy assassination|coverage]] being especially noted), and as such reflected the relatively crude technology and procedures of that era. Such breaks are now common at 24-hour [[news channel]]s, which may have an anchor available for live interruption at any time. Some networks, such as [[Sky News]], largely emphasize this, even advertising the station/network as being "''first for breaking news''".

Another type of breaking news is that of [[severe weather]] events, which had such coverage evolve in a very similar manner. In [[North America]] until the 1990s, television and radio stations normally only provided long-form weather coverage during immediate, ongoing threats (such as a [[tornado]] that has been confirmed visually or by [[Doppler weather radar|radar]] to be producing damage or a landfalling [[hurricane]]); cut-ins and, in the case of television stations, [[news ticker|alert crawls]] during regular programming were used otherwise, even when higher-end alerts such as [[tornado warning]]s were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The History (and Future) of Tornado Warning Dissemination in the United States|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1|author=Timothy A. Coleman|author2=Kevin R. Knupp|author3=[[James Spann]]|author4=J. B. Elliot|author5=Brian E. Peters|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|format=[[PDF]]|date=May 2011 |doi=10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1 |volume=92 |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |pages=567–582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in newsgathering and weather technology (including the deployment of [[helicopter]]s to provide aerial coverage and radar systems that can detect specific storm attributes), coupled with a few highly life-threatening events during the 1990s (such as [[Hurricane Andrew]] and the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]]) and the resulting heightened urgency to advise those in the storm's path to take safety precautions in advance made extended (or "wall-to-wall") weather coverage once a high-end alert is issued more common in storm-prone areas, with cut-ins only being used in weather events of lesser severity.

In various countries and at various news outlets, terms such as "(late)breaking", "urgent", "flash", "bulletin", and "alert" may accompany breaking news reports. The term ''breaking news'' has come to replace the older use of ''news bulletin'', with the latter term relegated to only the most extraordinary of events. There has been widespread use of ''breaking news'' at the local level, particularly when one station in a [[media market|market]] wants to emphasize the exclusivity of coverage. Not all viewers agree that stories assigned as ''breaking news'' rise to the significance or level of interest that warrant such a designation.

American network news divisions still use the term ''special report'' for either a breaking news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check Out Latest Breaking News Headlines|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news|publisher=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a developing news story or both, but tend to use the term ''breaking news'' on their [[Breakfast television|morning]] and evening news programs. Most local stations across the United States that interrupt regular programming for a news story use the ''breaking news'' and ''special report'' terms (though, local broadcast news outlets use the former most often), with a voice-over stating either "This is a breaking news special report" or "This is a special breaking news report" or "This is a(n) (network name) News Special Report" or "This is a(n) (station brand name) breaking news (special) report" or "(From [station brand name],) this is breaking news." The breaking news ending has a past-tense variation, followed by a disclaimer for viewers who would like more information to see the network's news division website.

However, "special report" has also been de-emphasized by cable news channels in the United States, as both Fox News Channel and CNN now use that phrase for regular programming; Fox News carries ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'', a daily political affairs program, while CNN's ''Special Report'' is a catch-all banner for CNN's library documentary and [[true crime]] programming.

==Criticism==
In early coverage of a breaking story, details are commonly sketchy, usually due to the limited information that is available at the time. For example, during the [[Sago Mine disaster]], there were initial reports that all twelve miners were found alive, but news organizations later learned that only one actually survived.

Often it is considered important to be quick with news bulletins also for less important news. Such news might not be updated later, even if it was found that information was wrong or severely incomplete. If someone (e.g. when editing Wikipedia) later wants to research the event, only incomplete information might be found.

[[File:MSNBC 12-28-17 breaking news.jpg|right|thumb|An example of "breaking news" with no new developments, seen in a screenshot of [[MSNBC]]'s [[The 11th Hour (news program)|''The 11th Hour'']], on December 28, 2017 describing events from August 2017 during the [[2017–18 North Korea crisis]].]]

Another criticism has been the diluting of the importance of "breaking news" by the need of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news channels]] to fill time, applying the title to [[soft news]] stories of questionable importance and urgency (for example, [[car chase]]s). Others question as to whether the use of the term is excessive, citing occasions when the term is used even though scheduled programming is not interrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Is Breaking News… Not?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://www.insidethecbc.com/breakingnot|work=InsideTheCBC.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208101055/http://insidethecbc.com/breakingnot|archivedate=2008-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs, such as [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]]'s defunct ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]'', used the term for recurring coverage of events which occurred months before, even when [[criminal trial]] coverage which may deserve the breaking news tag was not occurring and no new information has developed.

In June 2013, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WDRB]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] gained notice in the television industry for a [[promo (media)|promo]] that criticized the broad and constant use of the "breaking news" term, explaining that it has been overused as a "marketing ploy" by other news-producing stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, on its website, WDRB posted "Contracts" with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to use "breaking news" judiciously (applying it to stories that are "both 'breaking' and 'news'").&lt;ref name=TVSpy06042013&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisville Station Stops Using 'Breaking News'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/louisville-station-stops-using-breaking-news_b92526|work=[[AdWeek|TVSpy]]|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chase's Calendar of Events''''' is an annual American publication, started in 1957 by brothers William (Bill) D. Chase (a [[journalist]] and [[publisher]] from [[Michigan]]), and Harrison V. Chase (a university [[social scientist]] from [[Florida]]).&lt;ref name="nyt-2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/dining/30holi.html | title = Having a Snack?

The brothers gathered information on events and the first edition of 2,000 copies was printed for 1958. "It was 32 pages, contained 364 entries and sold for $1", while recent editions are 752 pages and contain more than 12,000 entries.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; A promotion sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce was added in 1958: a pamphlet listed commercial promotions as Special Days, Weeks and Months, and remained in future editions.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; Contemporary Books in Chicago, Illinois, took over publication in 1983 and the Chases retired in 1987 from compiling the calendar, which is now handled by an in-house staff of editors and researchers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36109">This is a chronicle of important events that took place under the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1636–1912) in what is now [[China]]. It spans from the death of his predecessor [[Hong Taiji]] (r. 1626–1643) in September 1643, to the emperor's own death on 5 February 1661, seven days into the eighteenth year of the Shunzhi [[Chinese era name|reign period]]. These dates do not correspond perfectly with the Shunzhi era itself, which started on 8 February 1644—on [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]] of the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar year]] following the emperor's accession—and ended on 17 February 1662 (the last day of the 18th year of Shunzhi), more than one [[solar year]] after the emperor's death. The posthumous events related to the Shunzhi Emperor's burial and posthumous cult are also included.

==Dorgon regency==

===1643===
*'''September 21''': [[Hong Taiji]] dies after a successful seventeen-year reign during which the [[Qing]] became a major power in northeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}} (p. 38), {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}} (p. 297), and {{harvnb|Gong|2010}} (p. 51) all place Hong Taiji's death on September 21 (Chongde 崇德 8.8.9). {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}} (p. 74) gives the date as September 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His death threatens to split the Manchus just as they are preparing to attack the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''September 26''': a [[Deliberative Council]] of princes and high officials is convened and decides that five-year-old Fulin, [[Hong Taiji]]'s ninth son, will succeed his father, but that Hong Taiji's half-brother [[Dorgon]] and [[Jirgalang]] will be his co-regents. This deal is a compromise between those who wanted to keep the throne in Hung Taiji's descent (the main candidate was Hong Taiji's eldest son [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]]) and those who supported Dorgon.
*'''October 8''': at the age of six ''sui'', [[Fulin]] officially becomes [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fang|1943|p=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1644===
*'''February 8''': in [[Xi'an]], [[Li Zicheng]] founds the "[[Shun Dynasty|Great Shun]]" dynasty and proclaims himself King.
*'''February 17''': [[Jirgalang]] willingly yields control of all official matters to his co-regent [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''March 5''': Dorgon sends an amicable letter to Li Zicheng proposing that they "devise a plan in common to unite their forces" against the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''March 17''': the Shun army occupies [[Taiyuan]] in [[Shanxi]].
*'''April 5''': Seeing the progress of rebel armies in north China, the Chongzhen Emperor issues a call for the immediate help of any military commandant in the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=641}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''April 24''': Li Zicheng enters [[Beijing]], the capital of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming empire]].
*'''April 25''': the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] commits suicide on a hill behind the [[Forbidden City]].
*'''April 26''': [[Wu Sangui]], a powerful Ming general, moves his army through [[Shanhai Pass]] (at the eastern end of the [[Great Wall]]) and marches toward Beijing in response to the emperor's distress call. When he hears that the capital has fallen, Wu returns to fortify Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu's departure from the fortified city of [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]], where [[Battle of Ningyuan|Ming armies had defeated]] Qing founder [[Nurhaci]] in 1626, leaves all territory outside the Great Wall under Qing control.
*'''April 29''': the victorious Li Zicheng holds an audience with several thousand Ming officials outside the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City. Assisted by his main [[Grand Secretary]] [[Niu Jinxing]] (牛金星), Li selected 92 officials to serve in the Shun government. The remaining literati are given over to Shun generals for punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=277–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 5''': Wu Sangui routs an army led by Tang Tong, which Li Zicheng had despatched to attack Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 10''': Tang Tong's defeated army returns toward Shanhai Pass with reinforcements, but is again defeated by Wu Sangui. Wu takes the city of Yongping (永平) on the road to Beijing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"/&gt;
*'''May 13''': words reach the Qing capital of Shengjing that Li Zicheng has been brutalizing former Ming officials and the population of Beijing. Grand Secretary Fan Wencheng uses these news to argue for a Qing intervention in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon agrees to mount a military expedition to punish the rebels and occupy the Central Plains of China.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 14''': Dorgon leads the Qing "Grand Army" out of Shengjing and starts marching south toward the Great Wall.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt;
*'''May 18''': After the defeat of two of his armies a few days earlier, Li Zicheng decides to take Shanhai Pass himself: he leaves Beijing with an army of 60,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}, note 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 20''': two of Wu Sangui's lieutenants arrive at Dorgon's camp at the [[Liao River]] carrying a message from their master asking the Manchus to help Wu defeat Li Zicheng's bandits and restore the Ming dynasty in return for "great profits" (大利).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=297}} (date of arrival at the Manchus' camp) and 300–1 (content of the letter).&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon sends a letter back to Wu Sangui offering.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Later that day the Manchus hear for the first time that the Chongzhen emperor was dead.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Still on that day, but as a result of earlier plans, small groups of Qing troops start to cross the Great Wall to distribute written proclamations announcing that the Qing army will not harm the population and will only kill Li Zicheng's bandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=306–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 25''': By that date, Li Zicheng's army was already camping in the outskirts of Shanhai Pass, near the Sha River a few kilometers west of the Shanhai Pass garrison; Wu Sangui sends his troops to confront him there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon receives a letter confirming that Wu Sangui has accepted to work for the Qing: he takes his army on a forced march toward Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 26''': having covered more than 150 kilometers in 24 hours, Dorgon's troops settle eight kilometers away from the Pass to rest for a few hours. They are awoken at midnight to continue marching.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt;
*'''May 27''': [[Battle of Shanhai Pass]]. At dawn Dorgon's main army reaches the gates of Shanhaiguan, where Dorgon receives Wu Sangui's formal surrender.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt; The armies deploy for battle: placed in the vanguard, Wu's troops are ordered to charge the Shun army, but they are unable to break the rebels' line and suffer heavy casualties. By the late afternoon, they are on the verge of defeat when a sandstorm starts blowing on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon chooses this moment to intervene: galloping around Wu's right flank, Qing bannermen destroys Li's left wing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"/&gt; The Shun army is defeated and retreats chaotically toward Yongping; thousands are massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 28''': Li Zicheng retreats from Yongping toward Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu Sangui is named Prince Pingxi; his remaining troops shave their heads and join the Qing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}, note 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 31''': Li Zicheng reenters Beijing with his troops, which started to loot the capital.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 3''': as a "final gesture of defiance" after his decisive defeat at Shanhai Pass, Li Zicheng officially declares himself [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Great Shun at the Wuying dian 武英殿.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}} (citation and date); {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=74}} (Wuying dian).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 4''': after 42 days in Beijing, Li Zicheng sets the imperial palaces on fire and abandons the capital to flee toward the west.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"/&gt; The Beijing population massacres rebels who had not fled; nearly two thousand are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 5''': led by Dorgon, Qing troops are welcomed into the capital; the Beijing population is shocked because it was expecting Wu Sangui to bring back the Ming heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=314–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 7''': Dorgon issues special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepts to cut their hair and to surrender, the officials will be allowed to stay at their post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=416}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See June 25.)
*'''June 25''': because peasant rebellions quickly erupted around the capital in reaction to the haircutting order of June 7, Dorgon issues an edict saying that people will be allowed to arrange their hair the way they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 420–422. {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=84}} gives the date as June 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''July 14''': Dorgon declares Beijing (which he calls "Yanjing" 燕京) the new capital of the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naquin|2000|p=289}} (gives the date as Shunzhi 1.6.11).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mukden]] (present-day Shenyang), which had been the Qing capital since 1634, is retained as a secondary capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rawski|1998|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''July 29''': at the request of his superior, German [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] petitions the Qing throne, claiming that the Jesuit calendar is more accurate than the other ones available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=857}}, note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''October 19''': the six-year-old Emperor arrives in Beijing through the Zhengyang Gate, where he is welcomed by Dorgon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=857}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''October 31''': the Jesuit Johann Adam Schall von Bell is made Director of the Bureau of Astronomy (欽天監) after a test of the Jesuits' prediction for an eclipse on September 1 proved to be more accurate than those of the court's official astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 857–58, note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''November 8''': a formal ritual of imperial enthronement is held for Fulin, during which the merits of Dorgon as regent are compared to those of the [[Duke of Zhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 858 and 860.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon's title is raised from "Prince Regent" to "Uncle Prince Regent" (Shufu shezheng wang 叔父攝政王), in which ''shufu'' (''ecike'' in Manchu) represents a rank higher than that of imperial prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 860–61, and p. 861, note 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}
'''Closure''' is the term used to refer to the actions necessary when it is no longer necessary or possible for a [[business]] or other organization to continue to operate.  Closure may be the result of a [[bankruptcy]], where the organization lacks sufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the [[proprietor]] of the business dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another organization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is the non-surviving entity in a [[corporate merger]].  A closure may occur because the purpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.

While a closure is typically of a business or a [[non-profit organization]], any [[entity]] which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a single church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for some reason, it ceases to exist.

Closures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of organizations are much rarer than involuntary ones{{fact|date=December 2013}}, as, in the absence of some change making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will continue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.

The most common form of voluntary closure would be when those involved in an organization such as a social club, a band, or other non-profit organization decide to cease operating. Once the organization has paid any outstanding debts and completed any pending operations, closure may simply mean that the organization ceases to exist.

If an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform a liquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are converted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is distributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law{{clarifyme|date=December 2013}} any remaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.

If an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare bankruptcy. If the organization is viable, it may reorganizes itself as a result of the bankruptcy and continue operations. If it is not viable for the business to continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy [[liquidation]]: its assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be liquidated, and the business ceases operations.

Possibly the largest "closure" in history (but more closely analogous to a demerger) was the split of the [[Soviet Union]] into its constituent countries. In comparison, the end of [[East Germany]] can be considered a [[merger]] rather than a closure as [[West Germany]] assumed all of the assets and liabilities of [[East Germany]]. The end of the Soviet Union was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because while [[Russia]] assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former Soviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is responsible for unpaid [[parking ticket]]s accumulated by [[motor vehicle]]s operated on behalf of [[diplomatic mission]]s operated by the former Soviet Union in other countries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.

Several major business closures include the bankruptcy of the [[Penn Central]] railroad, the [[Enron scandal]]s, and [[MCI Worldcom]]'s bankruptcy and eventual merger into [[Verizon]].

For example, the [[Vikings]] (c. 1000) had previously established a settlement at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. However, the information regarding other events did not advance the exploration of the Americas by Europe as a whole. See [[Discovery of the Americas]] for other "Americas discovery".&lt;/ref&gt; (1492)

* [[James Watt (inventor)|Watt's]] [[Watt steam engine|Invention of the Steam-Engine]] (1769)&lt;ref&gt;The [[steam engine]] was progressively developed; The [[Watt steam engine]] was developed sporadically from 1763 to 1775. The great step in the development of the steam engine that Watt added was the condensing chamber, a key refinement. Also, this design offered a dramatic increase in [[fuel efficiency]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Independence of the United States]] (1776)

Shortcuts in engineering design can lead to '''engineering disasters'''.  Engineering is the science and technology used to meet the needs and demands of society.&lt;ref&gt;"Engineering." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These demands include [[buildings]], [[aircraft]], [[Marine vessel|vessel]]s, and computer software. In order to meet society’s demands, the creation of newer technology and infrastructure must be met efficiently and cost-effectively.  To accomplish this, managers and engineers have to have a mutual approach to the specified demand at hand. This can lead to shortcuts in engineering design to reduce costs of construction and fabrication. Occasionally, these shortcuts can lead to unexpected design failures.

==Importance of safety==
In the field of engineering, the importance of safety is emphasized. Learning from past engineering failures and infamous disasters such as the Challenger explosion brings the sense of reality to what can happen when appropriate safety precautions are not taken. Safety tests such as [[tensile testing]], [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), and failure theories help provide information to design engineers about what maximum forces and stresses can be applied to a certain region of a design. These precautionary measures help prevent failures due to overloading and deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dax|first=Mark|title=Failure Analysis Prevents Disaster Reoccurance|journal=R&amp;D Magazine|date=Dec 1997|pages=30–31|publisher=EBSOhost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of failure==
Failure occurs when a structure or device has been used past the limits of design that inhibits proper function.&lt;ref&gt;"Failure." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; If a structure is designed to only support a certain amount of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], or loading and the user applies greater amounts, the structure will begin to deform and eventually fail. Several factors contribute to failure including a flawed design, improper use, financial costs, and miscommunication.

==Failure due to static loading==
[[File:Metal yield.svg|thumbnail|Stress–strain curve showing typical yield behavior for ductile metals. Stress (σ) is shown as a function of strain (ϵ). Stress and strain are correlated through Young's Modulus: σ=Eϵ where E is the slope of the linear section of the plot.]]
Static loading is when a force is applied slowly to an object or structure. Static load tests such as tensile testing, bending tests, and torsion tests help determine the maximum loads that a design can withstand without permanent deformation or failure. Tensile testing is common when calculating a stress-strain curve which can determine the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate strength]] of a specific test specimen.

[[File:Tensile testing on a coir composite.jpg|thumbnail|Tensile testing on a composite specimen]]

The specimen is stretched slowly in tension until it breaks, while the load and the distance across the gage length are continuously monitored. A sample subjected to a tensile test can typically withstand stresses higher than its yield stress without breaking. At a certain point, however, the sample will break into two pieces. This happens because the microscopic cracks that resulted from yielding will spread to large scales. The stress at the point of complete breakage is called a material’s ultimate tensile strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doehring|first=James|first2=Lauren|last2=Fritsky|title=What Is a Static Load?|publisher=WiseGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a [[stress-strain curve]] of the material's behavior under static loading. Through this tensile testing, the yield strength is found at the point where the material begins to yield more readily to the applied stress, and its rate of deformation increases.&lt;ref name="Machine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Robert L.|title=Machine Design: An Integrated Approach|location=Boston|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure due to fatigue==
When a material undergoes permanent deformation from exposure to radical temperatures or constant loading, the functionality of the material can become impaired.&lt;ref&gt;"CreepAbout Our Definitions: All Forms of a Word (noun, Verb, Etc.) Are Now Displayed on One Page." Merriam-Webster. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Materials" /&gt; This time–dependent plastic distortion of material is known as [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. Stress and temperature are both major factors of the rate of creep. In order for a design to be considered safe, the deformation due to creep must be much less than the strain at which failure occurs. Once the static loading causes the specimen to surpass this point the specimen will begin permanent, or plastic, deformation.&lt;ref name="Materials"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbeler|first=R. C.|title=Mechanics of Materials|location=Boston|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mechanical design, most failures are due to time-varying, or dynamic, loads that are applied to a system. This phenomenon is known as fatigue failure. [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]] is known as the weakness in a material due to variations of stress that are repeatedly applied to said material.&lt;ref&gt;"Fatigue." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when stretching a rubber band to a certain length without breaking it (i.e. not surpassing the yield stress of the rubber band) the rubber band will return to its original form after release; however, repeatedly stretching the rubber band with the same amount of force thousands of times would create micro-cracks in the band which would lead to the rubber band being snapped. The same principle is applied to mechanical materials such as metals.&lt;ref name="Machine" /&gt;

Fatigue failure always begins at a crack that may form over time or due to the manufacturing process used. The three stages of fatigue failure are: 
* 1.) Crack initiation- when repeated stress creates a fracture in the material being used
* 2.) Crack propagation- when the initiated crack develops in the material to a larger scale due to tensile stress.
* 3.) Sudden fracture failure- caused by unstable crack growth to the point where the material will fail

Note that fatigue does not imply that the strength of the material is lessened after failure. This notion was originally referred to a material becoming "tired" after cyclic loading.&lt;ref name="Machine"/&gt;

==Failure due to miscommunication==

Engineering is a precise discipline and in order to be precise, communication among project developers is pertinent for a successful product. There are several forms of miscommunication that can lead to a flawed design in a system. There are various fields of engineering that have to intercommunicate when working toward a mutual goal. These fields include civil, electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, biological, and environmental engineering. When creating a modern automobile, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and environmental engineers are required to work together to produce a fuel-efficient, durable product for consumers. If engineers do not adequately communicate among one another, a potential design could have flaws and be unsafe for consumer purchase. '''Engineering disasters''' can be a result of such miscommunication. Such disasters include the [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] during [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]], and the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]].&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Richard D.|title=Investigation of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Walkways Collapse|location=Washington, D.C.|journal=U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2070 |publisher=United States Department of Defense |title=Defense.gov News Transcript: Defense Department Special Briefing on Efforts to Mitigate Infrastructure Damage from Hurricane Katrina |author1=Carl Strock |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=22 Feb 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231001622/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2070 |archivedate=2012-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

==Failure due to software==

Software has played a role in many high-profile disasters.

*[[Mars Climate Orbiter|Mars probe]]
*[[Denver International Airport#Automated baggage system|Denver International Airport - Automated baggage system]]
*[[TAURUS (share trading)|TAURUS]] — UK share [[settlement (finance)|settlement]] system and [[dematerialised]] [[central share depository]].

*[[Patriot missile|Failure at Dharan]] — Patriot Missile clock issue.

==Infamous disasters in engineering==
Engineering products and inventions are utilized everyday including computers, microwaves, and elevators. A broken microwave can have limited consequences; however, when larger projects such as infrastructures and airplanes fail, multiple people can be affected which leads to an '''engineering disaster'''. A disaster is defined as a calamity that results in significant damage which may include the loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Disaster." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale engineering disasters are recorded in the history books. Just like any other mistake, these disasters become reminders and guidelines of how to improve and not repeat the same mistakes. In-depth observations and post-disaster analysis have been documented to a large extent to help prevent similar disasters from occurring.

====Hyatt Regency Hotel walkway collapse (1981)====
{{Main article|Hyatt Regency walkway collapse}}

[[File:HRWalkway.svg|thumbnail|left|Depiction of the modified design made by the fabricator]]

On the night of July 17, 1981, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[United States]], two suspended walkways of the [[Hyatt Regency Hotel]] collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring 200 more. During this calamity, the hotel was hosting a dance competition. There were numerous competition attendants and observers standing and dancing on the suspended walkways when connections supporting the ceiling rods that hoisted both the second and fourth floor walkways across the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] failed and collapsed onto the crowded first floor atrium below.&lt;ref name="Hyatt2"&gt;"Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse." ENGINEERING.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During investigation after the walkway collapse, architectural engineer Wayne G. Lischka noticed a substantial alteration of the original design. The fabricator constructed a double-rod support system rather than the originally designed single-rod system without approval of the engineering design team. In doing so, the created support beams doubled the loading on the connector which resulted in the failure of the walkway. It was documented that even the single-rod system would have barely supported the expected load and would not have met Kansas City Building Code standards.&lt;ref name="Hyatt2" /&gt;

The final analysis of the damage had several conclusions reported including:
* The maximum load capacity of the fourth floor walkway was only 53% the maximum load capacity of Kansas City Building Code standards
* The fabrication alterations from the original design doubled the load that was received by the fourth floor walkway
* The deformation and distortion of the fourth floor hanger rods support the notion that the collapse began at that point
* No evidence that the quality of construction or material selection played a role in the walkway collapse.&lt;ref name="Hyatt" /&gt;

===Aeronautics===

====Challenger explosion (1986)====
{{Main article|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster}}
The '''Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster''' occurred on January 28, 1986, when the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'' (OV-099)]] (mission [[STS-51-L]]) broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members. Disintegration of the vehicle began after an [[O-ring]] seal in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff.

====Columbia disaster (2003)====
{{Main article|Space Shuttle Columbia disaster}}

[[File:Crew of STS-107, official photo.jpg|thumbnail|left|The crew of the STS-107 mission.]]

The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, while reentering Earth's atmosphere over [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]]. The shuttle unexpectedly disintegrated, resulting in the death of all seven astronauts on board. The cause was later discovered to be damage to thermal shielding tiles from impact with a falling piece of foam insulation of an external tank during launch. It was the seventh known instance of this particular piece breaking free during launch.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Accident Investigation Board, Report Volume 1, August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As the shuttle re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of Mach 23 (28,400km/h ; 17,647mph), the wing experienced temperatures of {{convert|2800|°F}}. The damage from the insulation strike experienced during launch proved fatal as the shuttle disintegrated during the mission return.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. L. M.|last2=R.|first2=Garud|title=Distributed Knowledge and Indeterminate Meaning: The Case of the Columbia Shuttle Flight|journal=Organization Studies|volume=30|issue=4|year=2009|pages=397–421|doi=10.1177/0170840608101142}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's investigation team found melted aluminum on the thermal tiles and inside edges of the left wing of the spacecraft, supporting the notion that the Columbia's destruction was due to hot gases that penetrated the damaged spot on the wing.&lt;ref&gt;"Molten Aluminum found on Columbia's thermal tiles". USA Today. Associated Press. March 4, 2003. Retrieved February 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger L.M. Dunbar of [[New York University]] and Raghu Garud of [[Pennsylvania State University]] procured a case description of what missteps [[NASA]] had taken that led to the Columbia spacecraft catastrophe. Mission control deemed that foam shedding was a not a safety factor prior to launch, believed damage of the shuttle panels were not a significant issue which in-turn delayed analysis on damages as of January 17, 2003, and denied mission action request between January 18 and 19. It was not until January 24, 2003, that mission control had classified the damage as a problematic issue. These missteps in communication between mission control and the debris assessment team inhibited a proper examination of the damages to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

===Vessels===

====Liberty ships in WWII====
{{Main article|Liberty ship}}
Early Liberty ships suffered [[Liberty ship#Hull cracks|hull and deck cracks]], and a few were lost to such structural defects. During World War II, there were nearly 1,500 instances of significant [[brittle fracture]]s. Three of the 2,710 Liberties built broke in half without warning. In cold temperatures the steel hulls cracked, resulting in later ships being constructed using more suitable steel.

====Steamboat Sultana (1865)====
{{Main article|Sultana (steamboat)}}

[[File:Sultana Disaster.jpg|thumbnail|Depiction of the steamboat Sultana disaster]]
On the night of April 26, 1865, the passenger steamboat Sultana exploded on the [[Mississippi River]] seven miles north of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. This maritime disaster is categorized as the worst in [[United States]] history. The explosion resulted in the loss of 1,547 lives, surpassing the total number of deaths caused by the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]''. The Sultana was overcrowded due to a soldier prisoner exchange towards the end of the [[United States Civil War]]. The overcrowding contributed significantly to the high death toll. Another reason for the high number of deaths is that the steamer was made mostly of wood, which was documented to have been completely engulfed in flames approximately seven minutes after the explosion. The explosion happened around midnight which was when the Mississippi River was at flood stage. It was documented that the single metal lifeboat on board the Sultana was thrown from the upperdeck landing on several people swimming from the steamer resulting in further deaths.&lt;ref name="Sultana"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berryman |first=J.O. |last2=Potter |last3=Oliver |first3=S. |title=The Ill-Fated Passenger Steamer Sultana: An Inland Maritime Mass Disaster of Unparalleled Magnitude |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |publisher=JFSCA |volume=33 |issue=3 |date=May 1988 |pages=842–850 |url=http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au/JFS/PDF/vol_33/iss_3/JFS333880842.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster was believed to be the result of a repaired boiler explosion that led to the explosion of two of the three other boilers. The boiler had been previously found to have had a leak and was improperly repaired by boilermaker R.G. Taylor due to orders from Captain J. Cass Mason because of time constraints in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. While chief engineer Nathan Wintringer approved the repaired boiler, Taylor stated that the boiler could not be considered safe since the boiler appeared to be burned from being worked on with too little water.&lt;ref name="Sultana" /&gt; Traveling along the Mississippi River, the boiler exploded causing fire to spread throughout the steamer. The fire on board led to the collapse of both of the Sultana's smokestacks, killing many passengers. The sultanas captain died with the ship.

==History==

Event chain methodology is an extension of traditional Monte Carlo simulation of project schedules where uncertainties in task duration and costs are defined by statistical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, task duration can be defined by three point estimates: low, base, and high. The results of analysis is a risk adjusted project schedule, crucial tasks, and probabilities that project will be completed on time and on budget. Defining uncertainties using statistical distribution provide accurate results if there is a reliable historical data about duration and cost of similar tasks in previous projects. Another approach is to define uncertainties using risk events or risk drivers, which can be assigned to different tasks or resources.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Information about probabilities and impact of such events is easier to elicit, which improves accuracy of analysis. Risks can be recorded in the [[Risk register]]. Event chain methodology was first proposed in the period of 2002-2004.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Event Chain Methodology is based on six principles and has a number of outcomes.

==Principles==

===Moment of risk and state of activity===

[[File:EventChainDiagramForOneActivity.png|thumb|355px|Event chain diagram for one activity]]Activities (tasks) are not a continuous uniform procedure. Tasks are affected by external events, which transform an activity from one state to another. One of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event occurs during the course of an activity. This moment, when an event occurs, in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using [[statistical distribution]]. The original state is called a ground state, other states are called excited states. For example, if the team completes their job on activity, they can move to other activities. The notion of an activity's state is important because certain events can or cannot occur when activity is in certain state. It means that the state of an activity is subscribed to the events. Events can be local, affecting particular tasks or resources, or global affecting all tasks or resources.

===Event chains===

Events can be related to other events, which will create event chains. These event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. 
For example, requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed. To accelerate the activity, the project manager allocates a resource from another activity, which then leads to a missed deadline. Eventually, this can lead to the failure of the project. It could be different relationship between events. One event can trigger one or multiple events.

Events can be correlated with each other without one triggering another one. In this case if one risk has occurred, another one will occur and vice versa. One event assigned in one activity can execute another activity or group of activities. In many cases it the execution of risk response plans. For example, event “structural defect is discovered” can cause one or many activities “Repair”. Events can cause other events to occur either immediately or with a delay. The delay is a property of the event subscription. The delay can be deterministic, but in most cases, it is probabilistic. Also risks can be transferred from one activity to another. To define event chains, we need to identify a "sender", the event that initiates the chain of events. The sender event can cause one or more events that effect multiple activities. These are called "receiver" events. In turn, the receiver events can also act as sender events.

===Event chain diagrams===
[[File:EventChainDiagramExample1.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram: local and global threats and opportunities with different probabilities and impacts]]
[[Event chain diagram]] is a visualization that shows the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other.&lt;ref&gt;Virine, Lev &amp; McVean, Jason. (2004). Visual Modeling of Business Problems: Workflow and Patterns, In Proceedings of 2004 Winter Simulation Conference, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Virine, Lev &amp; Rapley, Lisa. (2003). Visualization of Probabilistic Business Models, In Proceedings of 2003 Winter Simulation Conference, New Orleans, LA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart. Here are a few important rules:

*Event chains diagrams present events as arrows on the Gantt charts.  
*Arrows pointing down are threats. Arrows pointing up are opportunities. 
*Issues are shown as an arrow within a circle. Color of the issue arrow is red (dark).
*Closed or transferred risks are shown using dashed lines. Color of arrow is white. Closed issue is shown in the circle with dashed border line. 
*Excited states are represented by elevating the associated section of the bar on the Gantt chart. 
*Colors represent the calculated impact of the risk. Higher impacts are red or darker shade. Low impacts are green or lighter shade. The size of the arrow represents probability.
*Event chains are shown as lines connecting arrows depicting events.
*Event chains may trigger another activity. In this case event chain line will be connected with the beginning of activity with optional arrow.
*Event chains may trigger a group of activities. In this case this group of activities will be surrounded by the box or frame and event chain line will be connected to the corner of the box or first activity within a frame.
By using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.

[[File:EventChainDiagramExample.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram with critical event chain and activity triggered by event]]
Another tool that can be used to simplify the definition of events is a state table. Columns in the state table represent events; rows represent the states of an activity. Information for each event in each state includes four properties of event subscription: probability, moment of event, excited state, and impact of the event.

===Monte Carlo simulation===
Once events and event chains are defined, quantitative analysis using [[Monte Carlo simulation]] can be performed to quantify the cumulative effect of the events.&lt;ref&gt;Goran Avlijas. (2018). Examining the Value of Monte Carlo Simulation for Project Time Management. Management:Journal of Sustainable Business and Management Solutions in Emerging Economies. 10.7595/management.fon.2018.0004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashyap, Heena. (2016). Risk Analysis and Estimation of Schedule Using Monte Carlo Simulation. International Journal Of Engineering And Computer Science. 10.18535/ijecs/v5i9.42&lt;/ref&gt; Probabilities and impacts of risks assigned to activities are used as input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the project schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, T. "Why Monte Carlo simulations of project networks can mislead". Project Management Journal, Vol 35. Issue 3, (2004): 53-61&lt;/ref&gt; In most projects it is necessary to supplement the event based variance with uncertainties as distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other parameters.

In Event chain methodology, risk can not only affect schedule and cost, but also other parameters such as safety, security, performance, technology, quality, and other objectives. In other words one event can belong to different categories.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Ruchi. and Virine, Lev. (2017). Monte Carlo Project Risk Analysis. In Raydugin, Y. (ed) Handbook of Research on Leveraging Risk and Uncertainties for Effective Project Management. IGI Global; 1 edition&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the analysis would show risk exposure for different categories as well as integrated project risk score for all categories. This integrated project risk score is calculated based on relative weights for each risk category.

===Critical event chains===
Monte Carlo simulation provides the capability, through sensitivity analysis, to identify single or chains of events. These chains of events can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main project parameters, such as project duration or cost, and the event chains. These  are called “critical events” or “critical chains of events”. By identifying critical events or critical chains of events, we can identify strategies to minimize their negative effects: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, or Accept. Event and event chain ranking is performed for all risk categories (schedule-related and non-schedule) as part of one process. Integrated risk probability, impact and score can be calculated using weights for each risk category.

===Project control with event and event chains===
Monitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is used to perform the analysis. During the course of the project, the probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual data. The main reason for  performance tracking is forecasting an activity’s duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and certain events are assigned to the activity. Event chain methodology reduces the risk probability and impact automatically based on the percent of work completed. Advanced analysis can be performed using a Bayesian approach. It is possible to monitor the chance that a project will meet a specific deadline. This chance is constantly updated as a result of the Monte Carlo analysis. Critical events and event chains can be different at the various phases of the project

==Phenomena==

===Repeated activities===
[[File:RepeatedActivity.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Repeated Activity]]Sometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already been completed. This is a very common scenario for real life projects; sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of a succeeding activity. Event chain methodology simplifies modeling of these scenarios The original project schedule does not need to be updated, all that is required is to define the event and assign it to an activity that points to the previous activity. In addition, a limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated must be defined.

===Event chains and risk response===
[[File:MitigationPlan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mitigation plan]]If an event or event chain occurs during the course of a project, it may require some risk response effort. 
Risk response plans execution are triggered by events, which occur if an activity is in an excited state. Risk response events may attempt to transform the activity from the excited state to the ground state. Response plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the response plan to an event or event chain. The same response plan can be used for one or more events.

===Resource allocation based on events===
One potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity. Reallocation 
of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value. Events can be used to model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.

''' Event management''' is the application of [[project management]] to the creation and development of large-scale events such as [[festival]]s, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or [[convention (meeting)|conventions]]. It involves studying the brand, identifying its [[target audience]], devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsborg, G.C.; B Miller, D Breiter, BJ Reed &amp; A Rushing (eds), ''Professional meeting management: Comprehensive strategies for meetings, conventions and events'', 2008, 5th ed, Kendall/Hunt Publishing, Dubuque, Iowa. {{ISBN|0-7575-5212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as '''event planning''' and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary [[License|permit]]s, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, [[catering]], coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans. Each event is different in its nature so process of planning &amp; execution of each event differs on basis of type of event. 

The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the [[Olympics]] down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, [[charitable organization]]s, and interest groups hold events in order to market themselves, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement.

==Marketing tool==

Event management might be a tool for [[Marketing strategy|strategic marketing]] and communication, used by companies of every size. Companies can benefit from promotional events as a way to communicate with current and potential customers.  For instance, these advertising-focused events can occur as press conferences, promotional events, or product launches.

Event managers may also use traditional news media in order to target their audience, hoping to generate media coverage which will reach thousands or millions of people. They can also invite their audience to their events and reach them at the actual event.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Event manager==

The '''event manager''' is the person who plans and executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical, and logistical elements.  This includes overall event design, brand building, marketing and communication strategy, [[audio-visual]] production, script writing, logistics, budgeting, negotiation, and client service.

==Event venue==
An event venue may be an onsite or offsite location. The event manager is usually not responsible for operations at rented event or entertainment venues, but will monitor all aspects of the event on site. Some of the tasks listed in the introduction may pass to the venue, but usually at a cost.

Corporate event managers book event venues to host corporate meetings, conferences, networking events, trade shows, product launches, team building retreats or training sessions in a more tailored environment.

== Sustainability ==
[[Sustainable event management]] (also known as event greening) is the process used to produce an event with particular concern for environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso20121.htm ISO 20121 - Sustainable events]", ISO (www.iso.org), retrieved 2014-30-05&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability in event management incorporates socially and environmentally responsible decision making into the planning, organization and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organization, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organizers, venues, sub-contractors, and suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/get_involved/live_green/at_the_office/green_events/|title=Organizing a Green Event|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

[[Event management software]] companies provide [[event planning|event planners]] with software tools to handle many common activities such as delegate registration, hotel booking, travel booking, or allocation of exhibition floorspace.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A recent trend in event technology is the use of mobile apps for events. Event mobile apps have a range of uses. They can be used to hold relatively static information such as the agenda, speaker biographies, and general FAQs. They can also encourage audience participation and engagement through interactive tools such as live voting/polling, submitting questions to speakers during Q&amp;A, or building live interactive "word clouds". Mobile event apps can also be used by event organisers as a means of communication. Organisers can communicate with participants through the use of alerts, notifications, and push messages. They can also be used to collect feedback from the participants through the use of surveys in app. Going a step further, some mobile event apps can also help participants to engage with each other, with sponsors, and with the organisers with built-in networking functionality.

==Education==
There are an increasing number of [[universities]] which offer courses in event management, including diplomas and graduate degrees. In addition to these academic courses, there are many associations and societies that provide courses on the various aspects of the [[industry]]. Study includes organizational skills, technical knowledge, [[public relations]], [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[catering]], [[logistics]], [[Interior design|decor]], glamor identity, human relations, study of law and licenses, risk management, budgeting, and the study of allied industries like television, other media, and several other areas. Certification can be acquired from various sources to obtain designations such as 
*Certified Trade Show Marketer (CTSM)
*Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM)
*Global Certification in Meeting Management (CMM)
*[[Certified Meeting Professional]] (CMP)
*Global Certificate in Event Design (EDC) 
*Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) 
*Certified Quality Event Planner (CQEP)

'''Event videography''' is a [[video production]], the art of capturing social and special events onto video by a [[videographer]]. The term is used to describe the [[videography]] of any event, aside from weddings and [[wedding videography]].

==History==
Event videography is an offshoot of wedding videography and encompasses the video documentation of social functions, such as [[First Communion]]s, anniversaries, dance recitals, bar mitzvahs, color guard contests, [[prom]]s, concerts, etc.

Event videography started shortly after the introduction of consumer-based video cameras, or [[camcorders]], in the late 1970s, as videographers, who had businesses documenting weddings, began to look for other [[Market (economics)|market]]s to offer their services.

==Event videography today==
The art of event videography is somewhat similar today as it was back when the camcorder was first introduced. The main differences lie in the improved video camera technology and equipment. Advances in [[High-definition video|high definition]] technology are being applied to event videography.

'''Jessica McClure Morales''' (born March 26, 1986) became famous on October 14, 1987, at the age of 18&amp;nbsp;months after she fell into a [[water well|well]] in her aunt's backyard in [[Midland, Texas]]. Between that day and October 16, rescuers worked for 56 hours to free her from the {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on|spell=in}} [[casing (borehole)|well casing]] {{convert|22|ft|m}} below the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc13.com/30-years-ago-rescue-of-baby-jessica-from-the-well/1555516/|title=30 years ago: Rescue of 'Baby Jessica' from the well|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/18-month-old-girl-saved-1987-article-1.2386153|title=Jessica McClure, an 18-month-old girl, is saved after 58 long hours trapped in a well in 1987 - NY Daily News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained worldwide attention (leading to some criticism as a [[media circus]]), and later became the subject of a 1989 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television movie ''[[Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure]]''.

== Rescue ==
McClure's rescue proved to be a much more difficult ordeal than was first anticipated.  Within hours of beginning the emergency procedure, the Midland Fire and Police Departments devised a plan that involved drilling another shaft parallel to the well and then drilling a tunnel at a right angle across to it. Enlisting the help of a variety of local (often out-of-work) oil-drillers, the Midland officials had hoped to free McClure in minutes. However, the first workers to arrive on the scene found their tools barely adequate to penetrate the hard rock around the well. It took about six hours to drill the  shaft and longer to drill the tunnel, because the [[jackhammer]]s used were designed for drilling downward, rather than sideways. A mining engineer eventually arrived to help supervise and coordinate the rescue effort. TV viewers watched as paramedics and rescuers, drilling experts and contractors worked tirelessly to save the baby's life. Meanwhile, they were reassured when they heard Jessica singing “[[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh]]” from deep in the well. As long as she was still singing, they knew she was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Darla|title=Baby Jessica 30 Years Later: 'My Life Is a Miracle'|url=http://people.com/human-interest/baby-jessica-30-years-later-my-life-is-a-miracle/|accessdate=15 October 2017|website=People.com|date=31 May 2017|quote=Television viewers watched as hundreds of paramedics, rescuers, drilling experts and contractors feverishly worked to save the baby's life.

The relatively new technology of [[Water jet cutter|waterjet cutting]], used to cut through the hard rock surrounding the well, was a vital part of the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Business Week|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-0dAQAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Science Foundation (U.S.)|title=Annual report for fiscal year ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EEc-gZcTJkC|year=1987|publisher=The Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron Short, a muscular roofing contractor who was born without collar bones because of [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] and so could collapse his shoulders to work in cramped corners, arrived at the site and offered to go down the shaft. They considered his offer, but did not use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= J.

Midland Fire Department paramedic Robert O'Donnell was ultimately able to inch his way into the tunnel and wrestle McClure free from the confines of the well, handing her to fellow paramedic Steve Forbes, who carried her up to safety.

== Media coverage ==
[[CNN]] was on the scene with around-the-clock coverage of the rescue effort. This massive media saturation of the ordeal prompted then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] to state that "everybody in America became godmothers and godfathers of Jessica while this was going on."

From the beginning and throughout the incident, the switchboard of local media outlet [[KMID-TV]] was flooded with telephone calls from news organizations and private individuals around the world, seeking the latest information on rescue efforts. In some cases, they shared their own insight into this and similar incidents.

In 1988, McClure and her parents appeared on ''[[Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'' to talk about the incident.

The photograph of McClure being rescued fetched the [[1988 Pulitzer Prize|1988]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography|Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography]] to Scott Shaw of the ''[[Odessa American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1988 |title= 1988 Winners and Finalists |work= The Pulitzer Prizes |publisher= Columbia University |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC made a television movie of the story in 1989, ''[[Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure]]'', starring [[Patty Duke]] and [[Beau Bridges]]. It featured many participants in the actual rescue and its coverage as extras.

On May 30, 2007, ''[[USA Today]]'' ranked McClure number&amp;nbsp;22 on its list of "25&amp;nbsp;lives of indelible impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koch |first=Wendy |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/top25-people.htm |title=Lives of Indelible Impact |work= [[USA Today]] |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following McClure's rescue on October 16, 1987, surgeons had to amputate a toe due to [[gangrene]] from loss of circulation while she was in the well. She also has a scar on her forehead where her head rubbed against the well casing. She had 15 surgeries over the years and has no first-hand memory of the event.&lt;ref name=Blaney&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www9.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110325/US.Baby.Jessica/ |last= Blaney |first= Betsy |title= Baby Jessica turns 25, gains access to trust fund |work= Xfinity News |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= March 25, 2011 |accessdate= March 25, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110326215656/http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110325/US.Baby.Jessica/ |archivedate= March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents divorced a few years after the rescue.

Paramedic Robert O'Donnell, battling [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] as a result of the arduous rescue effort and struggling to cope with the abrupt decline of the fame and recognition that had been lavished on him following his heroic act, committed suicide in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belkin|first1=Lisa |title=Death on the CNN Curve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/23/magazine/death-on-the-cnn-curve.html |accessdate=July 18, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=July 23, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McClure graduated from [[Greenwood Independent School District|Greenwood High School]], in a small community near Midland, in May 2004. On January 28, 2006, nineteen-year-old McClure married Daniel Morales at [[Church of Christ]] in [[Notrees, Texas]], about 40 miles from Midland. They met at a day care center where she worked with his sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Celizic |first= Mike |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19165433/ |title= Baby Jessica 20&amp;nbsp;Years Later |publisher= [[MSNBC]] |date= November 6, 2007 |accessdate= November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, a boy born 2007 and a girl born 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://people.com/human-interest/baby-jessica-on-the-30-year-anniversary-of-her-rescue-from-a-well-her-life-as-a-wife-and-mom/|title=Baby Jessica On the 30 Year Anniversary of Her Rescue from a Well: Her Life as a Wife and Mom|first=Steve|last=Helling|date=October 16, 2017|publisher=[[People magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When McClure turned 25 on March 26, 2011, she received a [[escrow|trust fund]] of donations worth up to $800,000. Her father said she had discussed setting up a trust fund for the college education of her children. It had earlier helped in the purchase of her present home, which is less than {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from the site of the incident.&lt;ref name=Blaney /&gt;

* In the 1995 film ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', a heavily fictionalized version of the Jessica McClure story plays out in TV and radio newscasts throughout the film. The entire nation is transfixed as a nine-year-old boy named "Ricky Newman" is believed to have fallen down a well in Fresno, California. Rescuers similarly dig a second well parallel to the one they think he is in, but James Cole (Bruce Willis) tells Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) that the boy is, in fact, hiding in a barn. He is later proven right. He knows this because he is a time traveler and remembers the events from when he was a child.

'''''Kalimantaan''''' is a novel by [[C. S. Godshalk]] offering a fictionalized account of the exploits of [[James Brooke]] in [[Sarawak]] in [[Borneo]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel uses of a variety of writing forms, including [[diary]] entries, [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, and straight [[Literary technique|narrative]] to tell its story. The author intentionally makes it difficult to determine what "really" happens in the story from dreams and fantasies of the characters.

==Plot summary==
In 1839, an English adventurer arrived on the northwest coast of [[Borneo]], commissioned to deliver a letter of gratitude to the [[Sultan of Brunei]] for having safely returned the crew of a British [[cargo ship|merchantman]], lost on his coast. It was a region full of [[headhunting|headhunter]]s, [[pirate]] tribes, and [[slave trade]]rs. Most Europeans with the temerity to enter the region had never been heard from again. This particular adventurer, however, seems to know how to play one power against another and manages to keep his balance in the midst of chaos. After performing a service for the Sultan (resolving a local tribal conflict through the use of his schooner's guns and leading an organized assault on a small native river fort), he is named governor of Sarawak, subject to the Sultan of Brunei. Within a few years, he has become the Rajah of Sarawak, an independent state, and established a dynasty that will last one hundred years.

Godshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. The real adventurer was [[James Brooke]]; Ms. Godshalk's is named Gideon Barr. James Brooke's schooner was named the ''Royalist''; Gideon Barr's is the ''Carolina'' (named after his mother). James Brooke was succeeded by his nephew, [[Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke|Charles Johnson]], who took the last name Brooke. Gideon Barr is succeeded by his nephew Richard Hogg (Ms. Godshalk does not deal with the change of last name since her story focuses on Gideon's life and ends with his death).

Although many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon's mother dies in Borneo much earlier while he is in grade school in England, providing him an emotional link to Borneo James Brooke did not have. James Brooke never married a European, although there is evidence that he was married to a Malay woman. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an "air of permanence" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on [[Margaret Brooke]], wife of the second Rajah, and her book "My Life in Sarawak". Gideon also maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship.

On the other hand, the 30,000 pounds that Brooke/Barr inherited at his father's death which enabled him to acquire his schooner, the massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The inquiry in Singapore was concerned with the battle of Labuan in which Brooke/Barr led British warships in a pre-emptive strike against a pirate fleet, breaking the power of the Bugis for the next twenty years. Brooke/Barr's enemies attempted to use this against him by claiming he had used British naval power to slaughter innocent natives.

Godshalk uses [[Malay language|Malay]] words extensively in the book. While she provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of ''Kalimantaan'' will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author:

On 10 October  2012, at  the [[Mexico–United States border]] near [[Nogales, Arizona]], [[U.S. Border Patrol]] agent Lonnie Swartz fired 16 shots&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23" /&gt; at '''José Antonio Elena Rodríguez''', killing him,&lt;ref name=shots&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/magazine/10-shots-across-the-border.html|title=10 Shots Across the Border|last=Binelli|first=Mark|date=2016-03-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that [[Criminal rock throwing|young men threw rocks]] at him and other law enforcement agents.

After the incident, the law enforcement  agencies stated the Mexican civilians were trying to stop them from confiscating a shipment of contraband drugs  as well as moving immigrants across the border.

Rodriguez was hit 10 times by the patrol officer's shots.&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carranza|first1=Rafael|last2=O'Dell|first2=Rob|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=31 May 2015|title=Justice for José?

==Incident==
Around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday 10 October, 2012, John Zuñiga, a police officer in [[Nogales, Arizona]],  received a call reporting "suspicious activity" on International Street, a road running directly along the  border. Getting to the scene, Zuñiga heard from another police officer from Nogales, Quinardo Garci, that  two men carrying "bundles taped to their backs" had climbed the fence into the United States. Identifying the bundles, on the basis of similar incidents in the past, as most probably containing [[marijuana]], they called out for back up.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;

After several [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs]] agents arrived, they saw the two men scaling the fence back into Mexico, empty-handed and with nothing on their backs. They commanded the two men to climb back down. At that time, Garcia and Zuñiga stated in their reports that they saw "rocks flying through the air"&lt;ref name="tucson.com"&gt;{{Cite website|title=Border agent's murder trial postponed|url=http://tucson.com/news/border-agent-s-murder-trial-postponed/article_561ac027-ef47-5d29-8d01-9c073669afff.html|format=|date=2016-01-05|author=Perla Trevizo|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|postscript=|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the assorted agents and also heard "gunfire," although they were unable to identify its source.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"/&gt; 

In the days following the incident, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] agency stated that
:After verbal commands from agents to cease [assaulting the agents with rocks] were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm. One of the subjects appeared to have been hit.

The person hit was José Antonio Elena Rodríguez, a 16-year old resident of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales, Mexico]]. He was unarmed, standing on the Mexican side of the border on a sidewalk on Calle Internacional street, in front of a doctor’s office, below a sign reading "Medical Emergencies" in Spanish. He was hit from behind by 10 bullets.&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"/&gt; The [[autopsy]] revealed that gunshot wounds to the head, [[lung]]s, and [[artery|arteries]] killed him.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR1"/&gt; 

==Trial==
U.S. Border Patrol agent Lonnie Ray Swartz was charged with [[second degree murder]] for the killing of José Rodríguez. It was the first time a US law enforcement officer was brought up on charges related to a killing that took part across the US-Mexican border, despite there having been a number of similar incidents in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=NPR1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis|first=Charles|date=4 January 2015|title=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Has Killed Nearly 50 People in 10 Years.

In the trial, which began in late 2015 at the Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Courthouse, the defendant claimed he had used deadly force because Rodriguez "had been throwing rocks."&lt;ref name=shots/&gt; Although a witness testified that Rodríguez was not throwing rocks at the law enforcement officers, evidence showed that he was, along with other youths and men. Prosecutors acknowledged that Rodríguez was throwing rocks across the border but stated "he did not deserve to die" for this.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mistrial announced for U.S. border agent linked to teenager's fatal shooting|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mistrial-us-border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-manslaughter-charges-today-2018-04-23/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Customs and Border Protection refused to release surveillance-camera footage of the incident.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

After the testimony by Emma Lew, the director of the medical examiner in [[Miami-Dade County]], Florida, who stated that Swartz's first shot "likely hit the boy in the middle of his back as he was running," the prosecution rested its case in the trial on 5 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040518_swartz_trial/swartz-trial-defense-struggles-with-first-witness-after-prosecution-rests/|title=

On 23 April 2018, Swartz was acquitted of the charge for second-degree murder; the jury was [[deadlock]]ed on lesser charges.&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael  |last2=O'Dell |first2=Rob |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=24 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
==Aftermath==
The judge presiding on the trial, [[Raner Collins]], declared a [[mistrial]]. The head of the Tucson union for Border Patrol officers, stated, after the jury's decision was announced, that "justice was properly served" and that the union was "pretty happy with it."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt; 

After the jury's decision was reported in the news, protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tucson late Monday afternoon, and blocked off the intersection in front of it. Among those participating in the protest was the mother of Carlos LaMadrid, another Mexican teen who, in 2011, had been shot and killed by Border Patrol agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/05/11/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-retried-death-jose-antonio-elena-rodriguez/602687002/|title=Border Patrol agent will be retried in fatal cross-border shooting of teen|date=11 May 2018|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=20 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar incidents==
A 2015 review by the Border Patrol's [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] department reviewed 67 shooting incidents that resulted in 19 people dying, during the period from January 2010 through October 2012. The review found agents guilty of criminal conduct in 3 of the incidents. Two agents faced disciplinary action in the form of an "oral reprimand."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

A '''latent human error''' is a [[human error]] which is likely to be made due to systems or routines that are formed in such a way that humans are disposed to making these errors. Latent human error is a term used in safety work and accident prevention, especially in [[aviation]].

By gathering data about errors made, then collating, grouping and analyzing them, it can be determined whether a disproportionate amount of similar errors are being made. If this is the case, a contributing factor may be disharmony between the respective systems/routines and human nature or [[Propensity probability|propensities]]. The routines or systems can then be analyzed, potential problems identified, and amendments made if necessary, in order to prevent future errors, incidents or accidents.

'''Leander William Tomarkin''' (13 December 1895 – 1967) was a Swiss [[impostor]] who claimed to possess a doctorate in medicine, as well as to have invented a miracle medicine for the cure of [[typhus]], [[tuberculosis]], [[meningitis]], and [[malaria]]. He ascended to become the personal physician of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], king of Italy, and he convinced [[Albert Einstein]] to become patron of a conference organised by him.

==Early life==

Leander Tomarkin was born on 13 December 1895 in [[Zollikon]], Switzerland. A doctor's son, he was the black sheep of the family, obtaining bad results at school and dropping a chemistry degree at college. He also soon developed a reputation of dishonesty. He did not take up regular employment but spent his time in his father's laboratory, hoping to invent something.&lt;ref name="Dreist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/s/tb/29653/hochstapler-leander-tomarkin-der-erfinder-des-antimicrobum.html|title=Doktor Dreist|trans-title=Doctor Brazen|last=von Lüpke|first=Marc|date=1 November 2013|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomarkin rose to fame when he offered to cure [[Pope Benedict XV]]{{'s}} [[pneumonia]] in January 1922. The Pope died without Tomarkin being allowed to treat him but reporters subsequently picked up the story and enabled the progress of Tomarkin's medical career with publicising his ''Antimicrobum tomarkin'' medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose active ingredient he named ''Aminoortobenzoilsulfoisoamiloidrocupronucleinforminsodico''.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt; The Antimicrobum was to reduce pneumonia mortality from about one third to 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomarkin was allowed to treat a cousin of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]], and the cousin recovered. As a result the king named Tomarkin the personal physician of the family. A clinical test at the [[Santo Spirito, Rome|Santo Spirito]] hospital in Rome was also successful, later attributed to the better care for test patient and the relatively early stage of pneumonia that the patients were in.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

==Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research==

In May 1924 Tomarkin emigrated to the United States, and three years later founded Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research. At this research centre he developed ''Catalysan'' and ''Disulphamin'', claiming that these medicines bring about mood changes and treat sickness in that way. The Tomarkin Foundation soon spread to Europe. Its dependency in [[Locarno]] started to organise conferences between 1930 and 1938. These conferences were set beautifully and had rich side programs and thus attracted prominent people such as surgeon [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. In 1931 [[Albert Einstein]] assumed the honorary presidency of the conference. Einstein only stayed in that position for one year, after a former landlady of Tomarkin contacted him to help retrieve debts.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

At the onset of [[World War II]] Tomarkin again emigrated to the US, due to his [[Jew]]ish ancestry. With the development of industrially manufactured [[antibiotics]] in 1939 his medical invention became obsolete. He ventured into other areas, trying to invent waterproof paint and [[synthetic diamond]]s but was unsuccessful with both. Tomarkin died in 1967.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

'''Let's Do It! World''' is a global civic movement that started from [[Estonia]], asking people worldwide to join a series of local, national and regional clean-up events.  Among other projects, it is the founder of '''[[World Cleanup Day]]'''.

The Let's Do It! movement was first conceived in Estonia in year 2008, where a country clean-up action called '''[[Let's Do It 2008|Let's do it!]]''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: "Teeme Ära!") cleaned up 10,000 tons of illegal waste by more than 50,000 volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead many countries also started their own country clean-up events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/domestic-news/general/15176-finland-gets-spring-cleaning.html |title=Finland gets spring cleaning |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715071118/http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Ukrainian Participants Clean Up Their Village |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new initiative called Let's do it!

Today, the movement has grown into a network of 113 countries. All together, 14 million participants have been engaged in movement's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Kalev Leetaru: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/07/30/how-pokemon-and-location-based-augmented-reality-could-save-the-planet/#4f804c9766cc "How Pokémon And Location-Based Augmented Reality Could Save The Planet"] Forbes, 2016-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2017, the movement uses [[W sign]] aka Three Fingers Up as a symbol.

==The origins of the massive cleanup movement==
On the 3rd of May 2008 over 50,000 people came out of their homes to clean up Estonia, the rest followed the process via all the media channels. That's 4% out of a population of 1,3 million - which would equal 15,3 million in the USA or 57 million in India. The idea spread from Estonia to the whole Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |title=Anti-garbage campaigners plan mass Internet-led clean up |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129054219/http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than 250,000 people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCNrezFwQUYGj2rJNJJ75ENwcDgQ |title=AFP: Massive clean-up drive in Latvia, Lithuania |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2010 Portugal cleaned their country with 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/20/massive-countryside-clean-up-in-portugal/ |title=Massive countryside clean-up in Portugal |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!|Slovenia followed shortly]], breaking all records with 270,000 people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2010/05/03/wv.clean.up.slovenia.cnn |title=CNN: Big clean up in Slovenia |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people have participated in Let’s Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries – Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/statistics |title=Let's Do It!

After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071639/http://www.letsdoitworld.org/news/civic-leaders-40-countries-gather-kosovo-erase-massive-waste-problem Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina], Kosovo on the 6th-9th of February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole World from illegally dumped solid waste and to then keep the planet clean. To reach the essential transformation in the global society, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world’s population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change.

==Biggest cleanup actions==
[[File:Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015.jpg|thumb|Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015]]
The most massive cleanup actions (data: October 2014) within the movement have happened in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo and in Albania.

In 2012, 289,000 '''Slovenians''' came out of the homes and cleaned up the entire country in just one day. This is 14% of the country's population.

In 2013, 375,000 cleaned up the country in '''Bulgaria''' in a one-day country cleanup action (13,9% of country's population).

In 2012, 210,000 people (10% of country's population) cleaned up '''Latvia''' from illegal waste in just one day.

In 2013, a massive civic cleanup action also took place in '''Kosovo''', bringing together 132,000 people (7% of the population) and in the same year, Albania also had a massive cleanup action, uniting 147,000 people (5,25%) to clean up the country in just one day.

In 2015, 250,000 people (8,6% of country's population) cleaned up '''Lithuania''' from illegal waste in one day.

In 2015, over 500,000 people participated in Let's Do It! actions in '''Ukraine''' cleaning up illegal dump-sites around the country.

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|380px|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (August 23, 1572) in Paris, France (painting by [[François Dubois]])]]
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being phased out due to its extreme size and impracticality. If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--Need to add: Jonestown Massacre--&gt;

The following is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "[[massacre]]."&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze&gt;{{harvnb|Mikaberidze|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[:wikt:massacre|Massacre]]'' is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people or (less commonly) animals; carnage, butchery, slaughter in numbers". It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history".&lt;ref name=OED_N&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use in English of the word ''massacre'' in the name of an event is due to [[Christopher Marlow]] who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as "The massacre at Paris"&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe (c. 1600) (''title'') The massacre at Paris". [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
''Massacre'' can also be used as a verb, as "To kill (people or, less commonly, animals) in numbers, esp. brutally and indiscriminately".&lt;ref name=OED_V/&gt; The first usage of which was "(c. 1588) Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the æternall, and massaker soules (...) are dangerous subjects",&lt;ref name=OED_V&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, v.&lt;/ref&gt; and this usage is not recorded in this list.--&gt;

The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically.
There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as [[:wikt:butchery|butchery]], [[:wikt:carnage|carnage]],  [[:wikt:bloodbath|bloodbath]], [[:wikt:mass killing|mass killing]], [[wikt:atrocity|atrocity]], etc. as well as euphemisms such as ''[[Sicilian Vespers|Vespers]]'', ''[[Blutgericht]]'' or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list.
''Massacre'' is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "[[Hilo massacre]]" and the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list.

==List of events==
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being reduced in size due to current unwieldiness; events listed should only include events very widely, or overwhelmingly known under a name including the term "massacre".  If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--
;Inclusion criteria
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "massacre" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a massacre does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word ''massacre'' must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#If possible, cite the date of the earliest authority giving the name in question under the "name" column
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.
;Notes
#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "massacre" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.--&gt;
&lt;!--''Note: the location column will sort by the following [[United Nations geoscheme|sub regions]]: Eastern Africa, Southern Africa, Central America, North America, South America, Eastern Asia, South-eastern Asia, Southern Asia, Western Asia, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, and Oceania''--&gt;

''massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy'' which term had been in use since the 17th century (Louis Maimbourg, ''Histoire De La Ligue'', 1686).
Appositional "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre" (rather than genitival "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day") first appears in American English in the first half of the 20th century (Oberlin Alumni Magazine 31.4, 1935, p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Boston Massacre]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was almost immediately termed a "massacre" and used for propagandistic purposes, especially by [[Samuel Adams]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment, which with the 14th regiment were then quartered there; with some observations on the state of things prior to that catastrophe'' was printed still in 1770.
Appositional "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, ''Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism'', 1803, 
 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=fvY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 p. 314]).
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance  held during 1771&amp;ndash;1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, ''Old Boston: An American Historical Romance'', 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.

It occurred during the peak of the nitrate mining era, which coincided with the Parliamentary Period in Chilean political history (1891–1925). With the massacre and an ensuing reign of terror, not only was the strike broken, but the workers' movement was thrown into limbo for over a decade.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

&lt;!--after 1930 or so, journalistic use of the term "massacre" becomes too indiscriminate to the point of being used synonymously with "murder" or "unjustified killing".
Questionable list entries also include such names for pre-1930s events which were coined only significantly later.

In fact, survivors who openly accuse the army for its failure to intervene also expressed no doubt about the identity of the killers, pointing to the Islamist guerrillas (e.g. Tuquoi 1997). Moreover, some of the troubling aspects of this story can be explained without reference to an army conspiracy. For example, in civil wars prisoners tend to be killed on the spot rather than taken prisoner (Laqueur 1998).11 Militiamen, the most likely to capture guerrillas, have openly stated that they took no prisoners (AI 1997b: 17). Journalists working in the field have found credible testimonies in support of the thesis that most massacres are organized by the rebels (Leclère 1997; Tuquoi 1997 among others). European foreign ministries believe that it is Islamist guerrillas who are responsible for the massacres (Observer 9 February 1998). Although, it is impossible to know the full truth at this point (see Charef 1998), the assumption that many massacres were committed by the Islamist guerrillas seems plausible and is widely adopted by area experts (Addi 1998: 44) and other authors (Smith 1998: 27). Likewise, the reluctance of the army to intervene and stop some of these massacres is also beyond doubt."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51760">This is a chronological list of conflicts in which [[peasant]]s played a significant role.

==Background==
History of peasant wars spans over a period of over two thousand years. A variety of reasons fueled the emergence of the peasant revolt phenomenon, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03066157508437962|title=The Late  Medieval Peasant Wars|author=Frantisek Graus|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=22 October 2014|doi=10.1080/03066157508437962|volume=3|journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tax resistance]] 
*[[Social inequality]] 
*[[Religious war]] 
*[[Wars of national liberation|National liberation]] 
*Resistance against [[serfdom]] 
*Redistribution of land
*External factors such as [[Black Death|plague]] and [[Great Famine of 1315-1317|famine]]

Later peasant revolts such as the [[Telangana Rebellion]] were also influenced by [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Maoism|ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/804/001/Skocpol%201979%20What%20Makes%20Peasant%20Revolutionary.pdf|title=Review: What Makes Peasants Revolutionary?|author=Theda Skocpol|date=April 1982|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peasant rebellions ended prematurely and were unsuccessful. Peasants suffered from limited funding and lacked the training and organisational capabilities of professional armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/bondeoproer/?tx_historyview_pi1[lang]=1&amp;cHash=f8911ce32f21435e54b5720e3e9db0f7|title=Peasant Rebellions|work=Danmarkshistorien-Aarhus University|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[journalism]], '''local news''' refers to coverage of events, by the [[news]], in a local context that would not be an interest of another locality, or otherwise be of national or international scope. Local news, in contrast to national or international news, caters to the news of their regional and local communities; they focus on more localized issues and events.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local Journalism and Local Media : Making the Local News|last=Franklin|first=Bob|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/aul/detail.action?docID=240326|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key features of local newsrooms includes regional politics, business, and human interest stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Kelly M.|last2=Tang|first2=Tang|date=2015-10-02|title=#SocialJournalism: Local News Media on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|journal=International Journal on Media Management|volume=17|issue=4|pages=241–257|doi=10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|issn=1424-1277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local news readership has been declining in recent years, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadbring|first=Ingela|last2=Bergström|first2=Annika|date=2017-02-01|title=A Print Crisis or a Local Crisis?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175–190|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Opt-outs of local [[television news]] are frequent before, during, or after national evening news [[television program]]ming.  Often times, television networks can also commission or make provisions for their local stations to produce a longer standalone local news programmes.  In some cases, local television markets/viewing areas within a country may even have a dedicated 24-hour local news channel. Local news stations have also started covering less and less local politics in favor of stories that they believe will garner more clicks or attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study has also shown that there has also been less investigative journalism within local news stations in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differences ===
Local news largely covers the following:
* local sports
* local crime and justice
* local weather
* local business and economy
* local events
* local education
* local politics
* local traffic updates (especially during morning newscasts)

National and international news, however, tend to cover a wider range of content, including news concerning specialized institutions of wide-ranging international power or influence, such as:
* (inter)national political and intergovernmental events
* stock markets
* (inter)national sports competitions
* regional environmental events
* media/entertainment events
* science/technology events
* air traffic/aviatory transport events
* defense/security events

=== Practices in each country ===
In the [[United States]], local news is provided on local [[commercial broadcasting]] channels (some of which are [[television network]] [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s).  They can either be standalone newscasts that run for at least a half-hour or short segments that air attached to national morning newscasts approximately 25 and 55 minutes past the hour.  As not all stations are owned and operated by a television network, the graphics, branding, and studio designs of a station's newscasts often differ from the network they are affiliated with although in recent years, affiliates have made some form of on-air reference to their corresponding networks in the branding of their newscasts.  In addition, the local news departments of stations also superimpose their on-screen digital clocks, thermometers, and (occasionally) local news tickers on graphics provided by networks during morning network newscasts.  Some cable channels are dedicated to local news coverage.  Examples of this include [[NY1]] in New York and [[NewsChannel 8 (cable channel)|NewsChannel 8]] in the Washington DC market.

In the [[United Kingdom]], most local news is provided on a local network station with similar branding and studio design to that of the national network news. Examples of this include the nationally networked [[BBC News]] and its regional news services such as [[BBC North West Tonight]] (on [[BBC North West]]) and [[BBC Newsline]] (on [[BBC Northern Ireland]]); the nationally networked [[ITV News]] and its regional stations including [[ITV Granada]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].  The long version of BBC and ITV's local news shows often air during the 18:00 hour on weekday evenings.  STV, which simulcasts most of the ITV network's programmes in Scotland, is not owned and operated by ITV but has its own branded newscast that broadcasts Scottish-centred news at the same time as ITV's regional news services.

In France, most local news is aired on France Televisions' [[France 3]].  Additionally BFM TV also has a local news channel for the Ile-de-France region called BFM Paris.

Norway's public broadcaster, [[NRK1]], airs a local news programme called NRK Distriktsnyheter (name of viewing area) every weekday evening at 18:45 Central European Time, just before the main national newscast Dagsrevyen.  A replay of all local newscasts across the country is shown on NRK2 the following morning (Tuesday to Saturday).

In Sweden, SVT's regional news is simply called SVT Nyheter (name of viewing area) which shares the same branding as the network's main newscast, Rapport.  Unlike SVT's counterparts in the US and UK, during morning programmes, the local news opt-out airs in the middle of each half-hour.  Since June 2007, the morning regional cut-ins no longer feature an in-studio presenters but instead show compiled short reports from various correspondents across the region.  When SVT World was still airing, the simulcast of the morning programme featured a different regional opt-out during each half-hour.  A 13-minute standalone local newscast airs at 18:30 Central European Time each weekday evening after Sportnytt (SVT's sport news) on SVT1.  Additionally, a short local news segment is incorporated into SVT's other evening newscast Aktuellt which airs on SVT2.  In that case, this local news segment shares the same branding and graphics as Aktuellt.  There are no local SVT newscasts on Saturdays.

==Newspapers==
A lot of newspapers specialise in covering the cities they are based in.  Although paper copies of local newspapers are usually sold and circulated exclusively in the local areas they operate (with entities such as libraries or relatives wanting a copy of the paper where a family member is mentioned being mailed copies of outside of circulation areas), companies may make digital copies of their newspapers available to interested readers directly on their website or through services such as PressReader often with a paid subscription.

In the United States, although newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have a 'national' focus on their front pages, they still have dedicated sections for news in the areas they are based in.  Weather sections also highlight conditions in the local area and the sport sections feature local teams alongside national sport stories.  Their local editions also feature local classified ads.

==Local News in the Digital Age==
In the age of digital media, local news readership has started to fall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be attributed to the younger generation's disinterest in traditional news sources and the inability of news stations to fully integrate their business models and practices into the age of digital journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While national and international news industries began using Twitter as a way to break news and interact with their audiences, local news mediums have fallen behind, trending towards using Twitter as a secondary source for spreading information rather than a primary tool for audience engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since Internet sites reach a larger audience, more local news agencies have started their own websites to compete in the digital age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Websites are a great way for local news stations to produce more interactive content, which engages the audiences and increases readership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from the Internet, Twitter specifically has become a great way to engage the younger generation in news, gain more readership, and spread information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; National news sources have started using Twitter to quickly notify the public of breaking news and to interact with their readers, but local news have failed to integrate Twitter and other forms of social media into their journalism practices as successfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While local TV news stations have actually been a bit more effective with using social media, local newspapers have overall fallen behind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By engaging the audience and spreading important information, social media has been considered a solid method for strengthening the core standards of journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, social media like Twitter has become a vital tool for news agencies to incorporate into their everyday practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a result of the transition to digital content, local news agencies have had to change their business models. Although they previously gained revenue from subscriptions, more agencies have started making money from online advertising, but this only accounts for a small portion of revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This loss in revenue has been linked to a decline in local journalistic integrity, because with less profit, the need to make money through clickbait articles has become a necessity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Career==
An Eric Trump Foundation staff biography of Patton states that she was involved in casting the 2012 and 2014 seasons of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref name="ETFBIO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkland|first1=Allegra|title=Trump's Onetime Rivals Resurface For RNC's 'Make America First Again' Night|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/speakers-convention-make-america-first-again-night|work=[[Talking Points Memo]]|accessdate=November 16, 2017|date=July 20, 2016|quote=played a key role in casting the 2012 and 2014 seasons of "The Celebrity Apprentice."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{tone|date=November 2018}}

The '''Marlboro M Hoax''' was a false rumor originating from satire news website ''Abril Uno'' on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abriluno.com/phillip-morris-introduces-marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=Phillip Morris Introduces ‘Marlboro M’ Marijuana Cigarettes|last=RapidxHTML|work=Abril Uno|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] joke.

== Hoax ==
The article claims that Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BARRY|first=RACHEL ANN|last2=HIILAMO|first2=HEIKKI|last3=GLANTZ|first3=STANTON A.|date=2014-06|title=Waiting for the Opportune Moment: The Tobacco Industry and Marijuana Legalization|url=https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en-US|volume=92|issue=2|pages=207–242|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12055|issn=0887-378X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article was quite obviously satire, it's intriguing title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=FACT CHECK: Has Phillip Morris Introduced 'Marlboro M' Marijuana Cigarettes?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/no-philip-morris-not-introduced-marlboro-m-cannabis-cigarette|title=False: Marlboro Marijuana Cigarettes from Phillip Morris {{!}} Leafly|date=2016-10-10|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannettes/comments/63jxuv/what_are_marijuana_cigarettes_called_cannettes/|title=r/Cannettes - What are Marijuana Cigarettes Called?

== Basis ==
While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially an addition to their company, long before rapid legalization came about.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/big-tobacco-pot-weed-cannabis-industry-727407/|title=Big Tobacco Is Already Eyeing Pot|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=2018-09-25|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marycarreon/2018/05/17/new-study-highlights-the-social-impacts-of-cannabis-legalization-in-california/#1836c73e2194|title=New Study Highlights The Social Impacts Of Cannabis Legalization In California|last=Carreon|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/22/big-tobacco-makes-its-first-investment-in-the-mari.aspx|title=Big Tobacco Makes Its First Investment in the Marijuana Industry --  The Motley Fool|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2018-07-22|work=The Motley Fool|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it would be illegal for such a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes, as its use is still illegal on the federal level (in the US).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12202">A '''media monitoring service''', a '''press clipping service''' or a '''clipping service''' as known in earlier times, provides clients with copies of media content, which is of specific interest to them and subject to changing demand; what they provide may include documentation, content, analysis, or editorial opinion, specifically or widely. These services tend to specialize their coverage by subject, industry, size, geography, publication, journalist, or editor.  The printed sources, which could be readily monitored, greatly expanded with the advent of [[telegraphy]] and [[submarine communication cable|submarine cables]] in the mid- to late-19th century; the various types of media now available proliferated in the 20th century, with the development of [[radio]], [[television]], the [[photocopier]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Though media monitoring is generally used for capturing content or editorial opinion, it also may be used to capture advertising content.

Media monitoring services have been variously termed over time, as new players entered the market, new forms of media were created, and as new uses from available content developed.  An existing group may provide such a monitoring service, as it relates to their main purpose, while a monitoring agency generally provides such as their main business.  Alternative terms for these monitoring services as well as the information they provide include:

*Press clipping service or agency
*Media cutting service or agency
*[[Information logistics]] service
*[[Media intelligence]]
*Media information services

==History==
{{See also|Imprimatur}}
Since [[mass media]] traditionally was limited solely to print media, naturally the monitoring was also limited to these media. The world's first press clipping agency was established in [[London]] in 1852 by a Polish newsagent named Romeike. Actors, writers, musicians and artists would visit his shop to look for articles about themselves in his Continental stock. It was then that Romeike realised that he could turn this into a profitable business. 

An agency named "L'Argus de la presse" was established in Paris in 1879 by Alfred Cherie, who offered a press-clipping service to Parisian actors, enabling them to buy reviews of their work rather than purchasing the whole newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history Media Monitors Interactive history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430192851/http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history |date=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[radio]] and later [[television]] broadcasting were introduced in the 20th century, press clipping agencies began to expand their services into the monitoring of these broadcast media, and this task was greatly facilitated by the development of commercial audio and video tape recording systems in the 1950s and 1960s. With the growth of the [[Internet]] in the 1990s, media monitoring service extended their services to the monitoring of online information sources using new digital search and scan technologies to provide output of interest to their clients.

Then, in 1998, the now defunct WebClipping&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webclipping.com WebClipping website]&lt;/ref&gt; website was the first firm to start monitoring Internet based news media, moving the industry toward tracking digital news quickly.

Typically, individual or organisational clients &amp;ndash; e. g. private companies and corporations, charities, government departments and ministries &amp;ndash; will subscribe to a media monitoring service to keep track of what is being said about them, their field of operations, their competitors, or other specified topics of interest.

==Industry==
The news monitoring industry provides government agencies, corporations, public relations professionals, and other organizations access to news information created by the media. Generally monitoring print, broadcast, and internet [[digital content|content]] for any mention of specific subjects of interest, a news monitoring company will analyze and provide feedback to their client in the form of press clippings, monitoring reports, and media analysis.

==Evolution==

From a cut &amp; clip service, media clipping today has expanded to incorporate technology with information.  Media monitoring clients can now opt to include print, broadcast and online to capture all their media exposure.  While this technology has allowed some of the process to be automated, many media monitoring agencies still offer the services of trained professionals to review and validate results.

Service delivery happens at three fronts. Clients may get their original hard copy clips through traditional means (mail/overnight delivery) or may opt for digital delivery.  Digital delivery allows the end user to receive via email all the relevant news of the company, competition and industry daily, with updates as they break.  The same news may also be indexed (as allowed by copyright laws) in a searchable database to be accessed by subscribers. Another option of this service is auto-analysis, wherein the data can be viewed &amp; compared in different formats.

Every organization that uses PR invariably uses news monitoring as well. In addition to tracking their own publicity, self-generated or otherwise, news monitoring clients also use the service to track competition or industry specific trends or legislation, to build a contact base of reporters, experts, leaders for future reference, to audit the effectiveness of their [[PR campaign]]s, to verify that PR, [[marketing]] and sales messages are in sync, and to measure impact on their target market. City, State, and Federal agencies use news monitoring services to stay informed in regions they otherwise would not be able to monitor themselves and to verify that the public information disseminated is accurate, accessible in multiple formats and available to the public. Some monitoring services specialize in one or more areas of press clipping, TV and radio monitoring, or [[internet tracking]]. Media analysis is also offered by most news monitoring services.

Television news monitoring companies, especially in the United States, capture and index [[closed captioning]] text and search it for client references. Some TV monitoring companies employ human monitors who review and abstract program content; other services rely on automated search programs to search and index stories.

Online media monitoring services utilize automated software called [[web spider|spiders]] or robots (bots) to automatically monitor the content of free online news sources including newspapers, magazines, trade journals, TV station and news syndication services.  Online services generally provide links but may also provide text versions of the articles.  Results may or may not be verified for accuracy by the online monitoring service.  Most newspapers do not include all of their print content online and some have web content that does not appear in print.

In the United States, there are trade associations formed to share best practices which include the North American Conference of Press Clipping Services and the International Association of Broadcast Monitors.

==Language and media – the big challenges==

In English speaking countries, the service of media monitoring, [[collation]] &amp; [[dissemination]] is fairly simple and most organizations which use [[Public Relations]] also use media monitoring. However, in multi-language &amp; multi-dialect countries the challenge of collating data locally and disseminating in a [[language translation|translated]] language of business (usually English) is a daunting task. The situation in other multi-language countries is no different.

The second large challenge for Information Logistics is the growing number of media and the media types. For example, in a country like [[media in India|India]] there are over 50,000 registered print publications, 250+ TV channels, a growing number of relevant internet sites and several hundred new blogs that need to be captured every day. Several of these need to be translated for a 'heads-up' and analysis needs to be constant and real-time.

===Illustrative examples===
An author that recently published a book and who has a strong interest in tracking how well the book is received by [[critic]]s may hire a media monitoring service. The service will have a method by which they extract any information about the author and their book from newly printed [[magazine]]s, radio programs, television programs and so on. The author will receive a printed bundle of ''clippings'', i.e., the pages of the magazines and [[newspaper]]s relating to them and their book.  They may also receive recordings of any radio reviews, television programs and so on, which refer to his book.

Most major companies and corporations subscribe to media monitoring services to keep track of any reports or comments in the media. A fast food company, for example, would receive summaries of coverage and/or copies of material drawn from a wide range of sources, including TV and radio news reports, commentaries on TV and radio shows, newspaper opinion/commentary columns, magazine articles and internet [[blog]]s.

The material collected would include any media items that relate to the company's commercial operations, its corporate [[reputation management|reputation]] or its media image. This would include reports about or discussions of the [[fast food industry]] in general, and any media item that specifically mentions the company, its clients and suppliers, its competitors or related interest groups or other specified subjects of interest, such as food/health regulations.

===Trade groups===
The [[International Association of Broadcast Monitors]] (IABM) is a worldwide [[trade association]] made up of news retrieval services which record, monitor and archive broadcast news sources including television, radio and internet.  It acts as a "clearinghouse" or "forum" for discussion on topics of collective concerns and acts as a united voice for the news monitoring industry.

===Professional organization===
[[FIBEP]] (Federation Internationale des Bureaux d’Extraits de Presse/International Federation of the Press Clipping Services) is a professional media monitoring organization. The FIBEP was established in 1953 in [[Paris]] and has close to 100 members from 44 countries. Every 18 months, the members of FIBEP members organize a three-day FIBEP-Congress. In work groups, workshops, reports and discussion circles, members discuss market trends.

==Law cases==
{{main|Associated Press v. Meltwater|Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)}}
Two parallel cases developed in 2012, [[Associated Press v. Meltwater|one in the United States]], and [[Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)|one in the United Kingdom]]. In each case, the legality of temporary copies and the online media monitoring service offered to clients, was in dispute. Essentially the two cases covered the same issue (media clippings shown to clients online) and with the same defendant, [[Meltwater Group]]. The plaintiff differed, being [[List of copyright collection societies|a UK copyright collection society]] (UK) rather than [[Associated Press]] (US), but upon parallel grounds.

The activity was ruled unlawful in the US (under the "[[fair use]]" doctrine) and lawful in the UK (under UK and EU copyright law, in summary on the basis that mere viewing is never an infringement, and temporary copies to enable a lawful purpose are themselves lawful).

'''Metro Broadcast''' Ltd. is a UK-based [[Event management|corporate event]] supplier with its Head Office in London and a satellite operation in Scotland with offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen.  The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[WPP plc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/companies/metro/ |first=Mary |last=Metcalfe |title=Metro |access-date=27 August 2018 |work=[[WPP plc]] |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180218060757/http://www.wpp.com:80/wpp/companies/metro/ |archive-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metro Broadcast is also the resident technical production supplier at several London event venues such as [[30 Euston Square]], a conference venue based at [[Royal College of General Practitioners|The Royal College of General Practitioners]], and one of Europe’s largest conference hotels, [[Hilton London Metropole]].  Metro’s production team also manages the https://www.youtube.com/yt/space/london/.   Additionally, the company is a preferred event supplier at some of London’s most precious and historic buildings including [[Somerset House]], [[Natural history museum|the Natural History Museum]], [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]], [[Worshipful Company of Barbers#Barber-Surgeons.27 Hall and Arms|Barber-Surgeons’ Hall]] and [[Middle Temple|Middle Temple Hall]].

==History==
In 1980, in a flat in [[Welling]], South East London, David Pacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=20080325125433W2407&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director and Brian Rottger, Technical Director founded Metrovideo. Its principal activity was tape sales to advertising agencies such as [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] (formerly J. Walter Thompson Co.), [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] and [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] (formerly Young &amp; Rubicam).

The company soon relocated to Landsdown Road in Stockwell and then, in April 1984, to the Old Bacon Factory in Great Suffolk Street,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimenow.com/united_kingdom/london/audio_visual_services-92/metrovideo_ltd-1492781&lt;/ref&gt; London SE1.

In early 1986, the business was sold to WPP plc, a British, multinational advertising and public relations company founded by [[Sir Martin Sorrell|Martin Sorrell]]. Metrovideo was the third company to be acquired by the Group.

Metrovideo later acquired a number of regional video businesses for itself including Horizon Video and Still Frame Video in the South of England and Teletape Anglia in [[Cambridge]]. This expanded the sales, installation, service, AV hire and technical event production&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/venuesevents/22615-variety-hosts-an-evening-of-magic-at-vinopolis&lt;/ref&gt;| areas of the company. A broadcast division of the company was located in offices in London’s [[Soho]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/metro-to-expand-broadcast-arm/164686.article&lt;/ref&gt;   All of these businesses traded under the Metro Group banner.

In 1990, Metro launched a full-service production business called G Force which later changed its name to Clever Media.  Clever Media was then merged into another WPP operating company.

In 1997, the company extended its operation into [[Scotland]] by establishing an office and equipment warehouse in [[Edinburgh]].

In 2007 the Company was renamed as Metro Broadcast Ltd.   In 2012 Metro Broadcast relocated its head office and main business premises to its current location in Oval, South London.  In 2014 it acquired additional workshop space to house its set and staging department.  Today, the London business is led by Managing Director Mary Metcalfe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmagazine.com/article/1294808/metro-broadcast-appoints-new-creative-lead&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish business is led by Managing Director Oscar Askin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventindustrynews.co.uk/brand-marketing/metro-ecosse-appointed-national-theatre-scotland-help-deliver-24-hour-live-streamed-event-theme-independence&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum of Hoaxes''' is a [[website]] created by Alex Boese in 1997 in [[San Diego]], [[California]] as a resource for reporting and discussing [[hoax]]es and [[urban legends]], both past and present.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, David, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/12/19/aboese.DTL ''"The Bunk Stops Here: An interview with Alex Boese, curator of the Museum of Hoaxes"''], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 19, 2002 (URL last accessed November 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman, A.

In 2004, PC Magazine included the site as one of the "Top 100 Sites You Didn't Know You Couldn't Live Without,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federatedmedia.net/authors/hoaxes ''"Museum of Hoaxes" (advertiser profile)''], [[Federated Media Publishing Inc|Federated Media Publishing]], URL last accessed November 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1558713,00.asp ''"The Museum of Hoaxes"''], [[PC Magazine]], April 20, 2004 (URL last accessed November 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and Sci Fi Weekly named it "site of the week" for the week beginning 7 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Dellamonica, A.

Boese has published two books on hoaxes: ''Museum of Hoaxes'' ([[E.P. Dutton]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-525-94678-0}}) and ''[[Hippo eats dwarf|Hippo Eats Dwarf]]: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S.'' (Harvest Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0-15-603083-7}}). A third book by Boese, ''Elephants on Acid'' (Harvest Books, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-15-603135-6}}), focuses on unusual scientific experiments. His latest book is ''Electrified Sheep'', published by Boxtree 2011, is also about strange scientific experiments.

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show ''[[NOVA ScienceNow]]'' on [[PBS]]. Since 2009, Tyson hosted the weekly podcast ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]''. A spin-off, also called ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', a successor to [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1980 series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fox |title=Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.cosmosontv.com/ |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] awarded Tyson the [[Public Welfare Medal]] in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html Neil deGrasse Tyson to Receive Public Welfare Medal – Academy's Most Prestigious Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210506/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}" (February 26, 2015).

[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Tyson to serve on the [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry]] and in 2004 to serve on the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |title=American Museum of Natural History |author=(c) Copyright 2003, American Museum of Natural History |website=amnh.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022134532/http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins at Howard University (2) - September 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|Tyson in conversation with [[Richard Dawkins]] at Howard University, 2010]]

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there."&lt;ref name="Rationally Speaking podcast"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Interview with Massimo Pigliucci and Julia Galef |url=http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs103-neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-he-doesnt-call-himself-an-a.html |website=Rationally Speaking podcast |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |date=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has spoken about philosophy on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of ''[[The Nerdist Podcast]]'', he stated that philosophy is "useless" and that a philosophy major "can really mess you up",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-neil-degrasse-tyson-returns-again/ |title=Nerdist Podcast: Neil deGrasse Tyson Returns Again |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Nerdist Podcast]] |last=Levine |first=Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was met with disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |title=Dear Neil deGrasse Tyson, don't be foolish about philosophy |date=June 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Chicago Now]] |last=Wall |first=James Kirk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806031740/http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |archivedate=August 6, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson Slammed For Dismissing Philosophy As 'Useless' |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[io9]] |last=Dvorsky |first=George |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328062312/http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |archivedate=March 28, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/ |title=The one thing Neil deGrasse Tyson got wrong |date=June 7, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |last=Neumann |first=Steve |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000625/http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/n|dead-url=no |archivedate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine |title=Why Neil deGrasse Tyson is a philistine |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |website=[[The Week]] |last=Linker |first=Damon |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416145135/http://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine|dead-url=no |archivedate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] later criticized him for "dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson and the Value of Philosophy |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci|dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421104308/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |archivedate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
[[File:Bill Nye, Barack Obama and Neil deGrasse Tyson selfie 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyson, [[Bill Nye]] and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] take a [[selfie]] at the [[White House]], 2014]]
Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="tysontranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=4 Dec 2012 |date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tysontranscript_video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony-video |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony (Video) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [[Penny4NASA]], a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,&lt;ref name="space-advocates-2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Space Advocates |url=http://www.spaceadvocates.com/about |publisher=Space Advocates |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.&lt;ref name="penny4nasa-whywefight"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Fight |url=http://www.penny4nasa.org/why-we-fight |publisher=Penny4NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Space Chronicles|Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier]]'' Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting [[Exploration of Mars|humans to Mars]], will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the [[United States Federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/neil-degrasse-tyson-how-space-exploration-can-make-america-great-again/253989/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: How Space Exploration Can Make America Great Again |first=Chris |last=Heller |website=theatlantic.com |publisher=The Atlantic |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal rights ===
Tyson collaborated with the organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) on a [[public service announcement]] that stated, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that kindness is a virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Interview With PETA |url=http://www.peta.org/features/Dr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also granted PETA an interview in which he discussed the concept of intelligence (both of human and other animals), the failure of humans to heretofore communicate meaningfully with other animals, and the need of humans to be [[Empathy|empathetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Exclusive PETA Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL6hj6xLE8w&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta.org%2Ffeatures%2FDr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx&amp;feature=player_embedded |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/05/peta-neil-degrasse-tyson-peta_n_912491.html |title=Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson Featured In PETA Ad |journal=Huffington Post |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/worlds-sexiest-astrophysicist-neil-degrasse-tyson-in-peta-ad-video.html |title="World's Sexiest" Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson In PETA Ad (Video)) |publisher=Treehugger |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |author=Kessler, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47915">''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' is an online team-based [[first person shooter]] developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment]], and released worldwide in May 2016. Normally played in matches of six-vs-six, players select from one of [[Characters of Overwatch|29 heroes]], broadly classified into the three categories of Tank, Damage, and Support, and work with their team to attack or defend map objectives. Each hero has a unique set of weapons, abilities, and skills, which players can coordinate to overpower the other team. ''Overwatch'' supports both casual and ranked matchmaking, as well as a rotating set of arcade modes, and the game has since become a popular [[eSport]], featuring a professional [[Overwatch League]] that started in 2018. The game has been both a critical and financial success for Blizzard, exceeding over 30 million players and obtaining over $1 billion in revenue within its first year.

To support ongoing interest in the game, Blizzard has run several seasonal events, typically coinciding with worldwide events and holidays. These events last for two to three weeks, updating [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to incorporate elements of that theme, and provide new game modes along with the opportunity to acquire unique cosmetic options. Players keep their earned character cosmetic options after the event ends, but the rest of the themed elements return to normal.

== Overview ==
Over the course of developing ''Overwatch'', Blizzard opted against using a [[downloadable content]] model to extend the game and bring post-sale revenues, as they had developed the game around the mechanic of allowing players to switch out to new heroes during the course of a match as to meet current strategic conditions; by requiring players to purchase new heroes, such a model would have hampered this approach.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: Development"/&gt; Instead, they opted to include [[microtransaction]]s through which players can buy [[loot box]]es, which contain four randomized cosmetic items, including characters skins, victory poses, emotes, spray tags, highlight introductions, and player icons. This allowed them to create an incentivized [[experience level|level progression system]] that would reward players with a loot box for every level they earned from experience gained in playing matches.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Progression"/&gt; Working alongside this, players can earn in-game coins through some loot box rewards or as a consolation prize for receiving a duplicate loot box reward. These coins can be used to purchase any of the available cosmetic items (with the exception of player icons), the cost reflecting the rarity of obtaining the item through a loot box.

Beginning in August 2016, Blizzard began introducing seasonal events, starting with the Summer Games event which corresponded with the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. ''Overwatch''{{'}}s director Jeff Kaplan said the goal of these seasonal events was to make the game "feel alive", correlating with real-world events.&lt;ref name="VG247: Seasonal"/&gt; The company has a history of creating in-game seasonal events, such as the Valentine's Day and New Year's events in ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Other competitor games, such as ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'' and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', also implement in-game seasonal events.&lt;ref name="IGN: more"/&gt;

Events have generally included at least one new game mode, which typically is only available to play while that event is active; one exception is the "Capture the Flag" mode introduced during the Chinese New Year event in early 2017, which has been brought back to the game as a permanent feature in the game's casual Arcade matchmaking mode. Players are typically rewarded with loot boxes for playing matches in these seasonal game modes, and the game offers unique [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] and associated cosmetic rewards for completing certain goals within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/173914/overwatch-uprising-achievements-how-to-unlock-all-the-new-event-sprays#.m0kj9F4sw|title=How to unlock all the new 'Overwatch' sprays during the Uprising event|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to new games modes, these seasonal events include unique cosmetic items that can be obtained primarily during the event. Blizzard develops a large amount of content for these events, not all which ends up available to players.&lt;ref name="USGamer: Events 2017"/&gt; Initially, these items could only be obtained through event-themed loot boxes that are guaranteed to contain at least one event-themed item, which could either be earned through leveling up, completing the event game modes, or through microtransactions;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer"/&gt; however, in response to player feedback and avoid an apparent [[paywall]] access to these items, Blizzard allowed players to purchase these items with in-game currency at a higher cost than a non-event item of the same rarity, starting from the second seasonal event onward.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer Problem"/&gt; When the event is completed, the themed loot boxes and cosmetic items are no longer are available until the event is run again. However, players retain and can use all unique event items they have earned after the event.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; Not all event items will be limited in this manner, as Blizzard plans to have certain event items be possible loot obtained from a regular loot box in the future.&lt;ref name="Kotatu: Special Skins to Regular Loot"/&gt;

Several seasonal events, such as Summer Games, Halloween Terror, and Winter Wonderland, have recurred. However, on bringing these events back, the development team has added new changes to the event to keep them fresh and to reflect any new heroes or other content added to the game since the previous event's occurrence; for example, the 2017 Halloween "Junkenstein's Revenge" included a new endless mode and support for some of the newer heroes.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Returning Seasonal"/&gt; Recurring events also feature new themed cosmetic items for these recurring events, along with the return of the previous cosmetics which can be found in the event loot boxes or bought for a reduced coin amount.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; Not all seasonal events are designed for recurrence, such as the lore-heavy "Uprising" event which took place in April 2017. Kaplan said that Blizzard has plans as to how these events will evolve in the future.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2016 events ==
=== Summer Games ===

In August 2016, Blizzard released its first seasonal event in celebration of the concurrent [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. Both Blizzard's "Summer Games" and the Olympics ran throughout the month. Summer Games added 100 new cosmetic character options and a new game mode, Lúcioball.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;

Lúcioball was designed as a futuristic [[soccer]] game in which two teams of three Lúcio characters attempt to push a ball into their opponents' goal. Played in four-minute matches on the special stadium map, Estádio das Rãs, players use two kinds of attacks to control the ball's movements: primarily, a melee attack and a secondary, powerful sonic boom that could knock back opponents as well (frequently called "booping" by players). Players can also use the level's environmental perks (e.g., jump pads and speed-boosting walls) to secure strategic advantage on the field.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' felt that the mode felt closer to a "multiplayer carnival game than a fleshed-out, standalone mode".&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror ===

Blizzard released its second seasonal event for [[Halloween]], which lasted throughout the month of October 2016. It included over 100 new cosmetic items (in [[jack-o'-lantern]]-themed loot boxes) and the game's first [[player versus environment|game mode against computer players]], Junkenstein's Revenge.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt; Several characters received new Halloween-themed cosmetic skins. ''PC Gamer'' wrote that they were among the game's best add-ons,&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt; and ''[[Kill Screen]]'' felt the new character skins were much more enjoyable compared to those offered for the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="Kill Screen: Halloween"/&gt; Players could now purchase the seasonal add-ons with in-game credits (at a premium), in response to criticism Blizzard received from players during the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt;

In Junkenstein's Revenge, four players [[co-op video game|cooperatively]] guard a castle door from oncoming waves of enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. Set in a themed section of the game's Eichenwalde map, players select a [[difficulty level]] and choose between the characters [[Ana (Overwatch)|Ana]], [[Hanzo (Overwatch)|Hanzo]], [[McCree (Overwatch)|McCree]], and [[Soldier:_76]], before fighting off approaching mindless "zomnic" drones, long-range "zombardiers," exploding tires, and costumed versions of the characters [[Reaper (Overwatch)|Reaper]], [[Roadhog (Overwatch)|Roadhog]], [[Symmetra (Overwatch)|Symmetra]], [[Mercy (Overwatch)|Mercy]], and [[Junkrat]] (as the titular Dr. Junkenstein).&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; The game mode includes new voice work and is based on a companion comic book released concurrently.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

The new mode was generally praised by commentators. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' wrote that the event resembled a similar event run on the team shooter ''Team Fortress 2'' since 2012. Though the reviewer found the Junkenstein mode pleasant, he wrote that in comparison to ''Team Fortress 2''{{'s}} [[Mann vs. Machine]] mode, Junkenstein felt "shallow" and similar to Lúcioball in its simplistic map flow, giving little room for player movement. He also wondered why the mode was limited to four specific characters.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Robert Purchase found the event fun and considered it a good distraction from ''Overwatch''{{'}}s main modes, but also recognized that if it was kept on after the Halloween Terror event, it would become a stale game mode.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Halloween"/&gt; Heather Alexandra for  ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the mode demonstrated that a co-operative player-versus-environment mode would fit well as a permanent feature within ''Overwatch'' as it required good team coordination to complete more challenging matches.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween"/&gt;

The event ended a few hours earlier than had been planned, leaving some players upset as they were waiting for as long as possible collecting the themed loot boxes in-game before trying to spend in-game coins or purchasing loot boxes to get the cosmetic items they were missing.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween early end"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland ===
The holiday-themed Winter Wonderland event ran for the latter half of December 2016 through the first days of the new year. Like previous events, it added over 100 themed cosmetic items for players to obtain via loot boxes or in-game currency, as well as provided snowy versions of two of the game's maps.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; One cosmetic items included the first Legendary skin for Mei since the game's release, a Santa-like outfit; with this skin equipped, it also changed the appearance of Mei's Cryo-Freeze from a simple block of ice to a frozen snowman.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Players criticized the skin, feeling that it did not vary as much from Mei's normal outfits and appeared to be a simple recoloring of her default skin, in comparison to what other characters' Legendary skins had been.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Blizzard admitted that their "'cool meter' was off" when they designed this skin, believing that players would take to the Cryo-Freeze effect as a reason to value the skin. Blizzard stated that they had plans for another Mei Legendary skin, along the lines of what players would expect, in early 2017.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei Response"/&gt;

The event featured a new [[deathmatch]] mode called "Mei's Snowball Offensive". The mode took place on the smaller Ecopoint: Antartica map, introduced in the previous months for standard deathmatch play. Six players each play Mei, but where her Endothermic Blaster, which normally fires a stream of damaging cold, can only fire a single snowball. Players must find a snowball pile scattered around the map to reload the weapon. Further, her Ultimate ability allows her to fire a machine-gun-like string of snowballs for a brief period. Otherwise, Mei's other abilities (Ice Wall and Cyro-Freeze) remain the same. A single snowball hit kills the struck until the round is complete.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; Kotaku claims this mode was generally not well received by players as the act of having to reload the Blaster made one too vulnerable, and with the [[permadeath]] mechanic in play, the mode was not fun nor captured the spirit of a snowball fight.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter"/&gt;

== 2017 events ==
=== Year of the Rooster ===
A [[Chinese New Year]]-themed event launched a few days before the actual holiday on January 28, 2017, and centered on celebrating the Year of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]. As with past events, the Chinese New Year event introduced over 100 new cosmetic items, including the promised new Legendary skin for Mei to make up for the poorly-received one she had gotten during the Winter Wonderland event.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY"/&gt; Other skins for Roadhog, Reinhardt, Winston and Zenyatta alluded to the Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Leak"/&gt;

The event introduced the first [[Capture the Flag]] mode for ''Overwatch'' called "Capture the Rooster"; Blizzard had looked at adding such a mode for a few years during ''Overwatch''{{'}}s development but had difficulty with the mechanics due to the vastly different set of abilities offered by the characters that could imbalance the mode towards fast-moving characters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF"/&gt; Played on the Lijiang Tower map, normally used for Control modes, each team has a flag near their base. To capture the other opponent's flag, a character must stay near the flag and not take damage for a few seconds. Once they have taken the flag, they then must return it to their team's base, scoring a point if they do so. If they die while bringing the flag back, either a teammate can try to capture it, or the opposing team must stay near the flag, avoiding taking damage for a few seconds, to return it to their base. Teams can score with the opposing team's flag even if their team's flag has been taken. The first team to three scores, or the team with the highest score after five minutes, wins the match.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Start"/&gt;

Following the event, Blizzard introduced a more general Capture the Flag mode, playable on any of the Control maps, into the Arcade modes as well as making it an option for custom games with several adjustable parameters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF added"/&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Uprising ===
Uprising ran for most of the month of April 2017, and was the first seasonal event not tied to any real-world event, but instead used to expand the lore of ''Overwatch''. The story centered around one of the last official missions of the Overwatch team before they were disbanded—having to end the threat of a hostile Omnic force known as the Null Sector in its attack on the citizens of London—; which also happened to be [[Tracer (Overwatch)|Tracer]]'s first mission. Over 100 new cosmetic items were added with this event, many based on the uniforms and backstory of the original Overwatch forces.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt; A digital comic retelling this story was released alongside the event.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt; According to Kaplan, the Uprising event was something Blizzard felt had been asked for by players since they started offering the seasonal events. Players had requested non-holiday-themed events, as well as sought more details on the setting and history of the ''Overwatch'' world.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt;

The event added a new cooperative player-versus-environment mode called "Uprising", played on the King's Row map set in London. In the standard mode, which can be played at one of four difficulty levels, four players select from the characters of Tracer, [[Reinhardt (Overwatch)|Reinhardt]], [[Torbjörn (Overwatch)|Torbjörn]], and Mercy. From there, the players are directed by in-game narration to take several control points while fighting against waves of Null Sector Omnics that try to stop them. Eventually, they must then escort an explosive weapon to a sealed door in order to access the heart of the Null Sector facility and end their threat for good. If a player was downed, any of the other still-surviving players could help them up by interacting with that character for a few moments (or through Mercy's Ultimate ability of Resurrection). If all four players are downed, or the explosive is destroyed before reaching the sealed doors, the round ends as a loss.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising"/&gt;  A separate mode allowed players to complete the same mission without being limited in character selection, but without any of the character-specific dialogue; Blizzard added this based on feedback from Junkenstein's Revenge, so as to provide a less restrictive way to enjoy the game mode.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising"/&gt;

The Uprising mode was considered a much-improved version of a player-versus-environment mode compared to Junkenstein's Revenge from the Halloween event. Cecilia D'Anastasio for ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt the mode was much more dynamic since it required players to move throughout the map rather than stay in one general location, and as the four default characters represent a balanced team, the mode calls for more careful teamwork and strategy. D'Anastasio also felt that with new voice lines to support this mode, it helped to establish the game's lore for players.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising Review"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' argued that the Uprising event demonstrated the potential for a strong team-based story-driven campaign developed within the ''Overwatch'' narrative.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising Review"/&gt;

The event had mistakenly ended a few hours earlier than expected on May 1, 2017; Blizzard apologized and extended the event for an additional day into May 2 to allow players to finish acquiring and purchasing the event loot boxes and skins.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising Ended"/&gt;

While the event was just named "Uprising" at its release, Blizzard stated in 2018 that they considered it to be the first "''Overwatch'' Archive" annual event that will be used to explore the history of the characters and narrative.&lt;ref name="polygon archives"/&gt;

=== Anniversary ===
The Anniversary event, ran from the end of May 2017, celebrated ''Overwatch''{{'}}s first year since release. Gameplay-wise, it added three new Arena maps used for the smaller-scale Elimination games, and which will remain in rotation after the events' conclusion. The Eliminate mode also received two variants. In one-on-one "Limited Duel" matches, each player is presented with the same selection of three random heroes for play for that round. In three-on-three "Lockout Elimination", the heroes used by the winning team on a round are locked out for the next round.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt;

In addition, over one hundred new cosmetic items are available, including new dancing emotes for each of the characters.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt; The dance emotes were found to evoke references to popularized dance moves in other works, such as Mei's dance being similar to the "Hare Hare Yukai" dance used at the end credits for the anime ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance 2"/&gt;

=== Summer Games 2017 ===
A second Summer Games event was held from August 8 to August 29, 2017.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt; This event brought back the 3-on-3 soccer-like mode, Lucioball, introduced from the first Summer Games, adding additional arenas for the event to be played in, but removing the ability to "boop" other players.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; In addition to casual matchmaking for Lucioball, Blizzard also introduced a ranked play system for Lucioball, separate from the game's normal Competitive mode. By participating in this "Copa Lucioball" mode, players earned Competitive Points (CP), the same in-game currency earned playing Competitive matches, and used towards purchasing special weapon skins (such as golden weapons).&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

The previous skins and other cosmetic items offered from the first Summer Games were made available again to obtain in loot crates or purchasable from in-game coins at a lower cost, while additional Summer Games skins were added, purchasable at their normal cost.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2017 ===
The Halloween Terror 2017 event ran from October 10 to November 2, 2017. The event brought back "Junkenstein's Revenge" from the previous year's event, but added an endless-mode variant that challenges players to defend the door through as many waves as possible. This mode allowed players to have four additional characters to select from, Genji, Torbjorn, Widowmaker, and Zenyatta, in addition to McCree, Soldier: 76, Ana, and Hanzo. Teams lasting the longest were tracked via an online scoreboard.&lt;ref name="VG247: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

New skins and cosmetic items were added to the event, along with the items from the previous Halloween Terror. With the exclusion of the tombstone victory poses introduced in the previous event, all these could be obtained from loot boxes or in-game coin purchase. Blizzard opted to remove the tombstone victory poses from loot box rewards as they believed these no longer fit with the characters' personalities, but still allowed players to purchase them in-game.&lt;ref name="Dot Esports: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland 2017 ===
The winter-focused "Winter Wonderland 2017" event ran from December 12, 2017 through January 1, 2018. It brought back the previous year's "Winter Wonderland" content, including the "Mei Snowball Offensive" mode and previous cosmetic items, along with new skins and other cosmetics. It also added a new Arcade mode, "Yeti Hunter". In this [[asymmetric gameplay|asymmetric mode]], five players, each playing as [[Mei (Overwatch)|Mei]], attempt to defeat one player controlling [[Winston (Overwatch)|Winston]] (acting as the Yeti) in a boss battle on Nepal's Village stage. Yeti Hunt is the first Overwatch mode to use role selection; players can indicate their preference to play as a Mei or as the Yeti. The Winston player must elude the Mei team, which can freeze him, use ice walls to impede his movement, or catch him in a snare trap (which replaces Mei's usual Ultimate). After collecting four pieces of meat, which spawn randomly in predetermined locations around the map, Winston unleashes his Ultimate ability for a short period which temporarily boosts his health, reduces his jump cooldown, and gives him powerful melee attacks. When a Mei player dies, they will respawn after a short delay and cost their team a life. The match is over once the Mei team either defeats Winston or loses all five of their lives.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter 2017"/&gt; Kaplan described the Yeti Hunt as a light-hearted mode to be played for a few matches rather than hundreds of hours.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2018 events ==
=== Year of the Dog ===
The Chinese New Year event reoccurred from February 8 to March 5, 2018, now reflecting the Year of the [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]].&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/lunar-new-year-seasonal-event-returns-to-overwatch-next-week-w516267 | title = Lunar New Year Seasonal Event Returns to 'Overwatch' Next Week | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = February 1, 2018 | accessdate = February 1, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; New cosmetic items relating to the theme were released, in addition to the existing cosmetics from the previous event. A new map, "Ayutthaya", inspired by [[Thailand]] and specifically designed for the Capture the Flag mode, was introduced in this event. Additionally, new Capture the Flag rules for all modes were updated, replacing the potential to have these end as draws by instead playing tie-breaking rounds with the teams' flags starting closer to each other on each subsequent round. The changes also eliminated the short period before players could pick up the flag, now able to pick up the flag instantaneously, but any use of a character's active skills or ultimate abilities that provide mobility or invulnerability would force them to drop the flag, and render the flag unable to be picked up for a few moments. These changes were to make games feel "much more offensive, and much more action-packed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/this-week-s-year-of-the-dog-event-in-overwatch-will-bring-a-new-map-486573.phtml | title = This week's Year of the Dog event in Overwatch will bring a new map | first = Jordan | last = Devore | date = February 6, 2018 | accessdate = February 6, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a competitive mode for Capture the Flag, following a similar format as the competitive Lucioball mode in the 2017 Summer Games event, was run during the event, rewarding players with Competitive Points and unique items for the end-of-event placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/overwatch-celebrates-lunar-new-year-with-new-map-w516551 | title = 'Overwatch' Celebrates Lunar New Year With New Map and Capture The Flag Mode | first = Blake | last= Hester | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the event, Blizzard featured its inaugural "Puppy Rumble", modeled after the ''[[Puppy Bowl]]'', on February 19, 2018, featuring puppies dressed in ''Overwatch'' character outfits in mock events. All of the animals during the event were put up for adoption through the event's co-sponsor [[Petfinder]], as well as promoting animal adoption through other local adoption agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/the-overwatch-puppy-rumble-celebrates-the-year-of-the-dog-with-real-dogs/ | title = The Overwatch 'Puppy Rumble' celebrates the Year of the Dog with real dogs | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = February 19, 2018 | accessdate = February 19, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Retribution ===
The ''Overwatch'' Archive event from the previous year returned, and ran from April 10, 2018. It brought back the narrative-driven player-versus-environment mode introduced in Uprising. It also featured a new mode titled "Retribution", which will take place on a new map, Rialto, which entered the game's map rotation as a Payload map outside of the Retribution event, on May 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-map-rialto-is-launching-this-week-f/1100-6458660/ | title = Overwatch's New Map, Rialto, Is Launching This Week For Everyone | first =Eddie | last = Makuch | date = May 1, 2018 | accessdate = May 1, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a four-player co-operative mode, based on the characters Reaper, McCree, Moira, and Genji as they escape from Talon forces; alternatively, this mode also includes an All-Hero mode where players can select any of the available characters. New skins and cosmetic items were available in loot boxes during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/29/17176928/overwatch-uprising-event-start-date-2018 | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns in April | first = Allegra | last=  Frank  |date = March 29, 2018 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon archives"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17189214/overwatch-archives-retribution-uprising-event | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns as Overwatch Archives | first=  Ryan | last = Gilliam | date = April 2, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/4/4/17193808/overwatch-archives-retribution-trailer-reveal-pve | title = Overwatch Archives: Retribution is this year’s Blackwatch PVE brawl | first=  Ryan | last = Gillian | date = April 4, 2018 | accessdate =April 4, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Retribution event was aimed to provide a more replayable experience compared to the prior Uprising event. This included eliminating the waypoint approach they as to reduce elements on the user interface and instead allow players to naturally figure out how to progress in the mission. They also included "specials", unique enemies with special abilities to pose an immediate threat to the players rather than just waves of strong enemies, and included an enemy [[artificial intelligence]] systems to better react to players, including in the All-Hero mode. Much of the ideas of this mode were based on concepts from the ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-retribution-development-heroes-specials-hanzo | title = Left 4 Dead was "a huge inspiration" for Overwatch Retribution | first = Matt | last=  Purslow | date = April 12, 2018 | accessdate = April 12, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anniversary 2018 ===
The second anniversary event ran from May 22 to June 11, 2018. Also with new cosmetic items, the event included a limited time competitive [[deathmatch]] mode with an exclusive map, Petra. In addition to previous Anniversary cosmetic items, all Anniversary loot boxes included cosmetic items from all previous seasonal events, and these are also available to buy with in-game gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/5/14/17348534/overwatch-second-anniversary-event-cosmetics-deathmatch-details | title = Overwatch’s second anniversary event starts May 22 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date =  May 15, 2018 | accessdate = May 15, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-skins-and-more-out-now-with-annivers/1100-6459128/ | title = New Overwatch Skins And More Out Now With Anniversary Event | first=  Patrick | last=  Faller | date = May 24, 2018 | accessdate = May 24, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summer Games 2018 ===
The third Summer Games event ran from August 9–30, 2018. The Lucioball event returned with a new stadium map based on [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/8/2/17646222/overwatch-summer-games-2018-august-9th | title= Overwatch’s Summer Games return August 9th | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = August 2, 2018 | accessdate = August 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2018 ===
The 2018 iteration of Halloween terror ran from October 10–31, 2018. The Dr. Junkenstein's Revenge mode was updated to include changes made throughout the previous year, such as the changes to Symmetra. The player-versus-environment map remained largely unchanged, with the 2 modes and 4 difficulties each of the last year's event. Brigitte and Tracer were made playable for the game mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/10/1/17922306/overwatch-halloween-terror-2018-event-date | title = Halloween Terror returns to Overwatch on October 9 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = October 1, 2018 | accessdate = October 1, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22475">The number of '''personal watercraft-related accidents''' has increased with the popularity of [[personal watercraft]] (PWC) (also commonly known as jet skis) since their introduction during the late 1960s. The use of the term "jet ski" for all types of PWCs is a [[misnomer]]; [[Jet Ski]] is a [[Trademark|registered trademark]] in the United States for a line of PWCs manufactured by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0913875791 | title = Boat Accident Reconstruction and Litigation | last1 = Rickman | first1 = Roy Scott |author2=Michael M. Sampsel, Jeanne-Marie D. van Hemmen | year = 1996 | publisher = Lawyers and Judges Publishing | page = 68  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased use of personal watercraft since their inception, the hazards accompanying their use have also increased. According to U.S. government reports, most accidents are associated with rental operators, underage operators, under-trained and undereducated boaters and a variety of factors associated with recreational-boating accidents (excessive speed, inattention, reckless operation, alcohol consumption and violations of the "Rules of the Road").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caufield|first=T.G.|title=A Beginner's Guide to the Rules of the Road|year=2001|publisher=Great Lakes Marine Transportation LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;Almost all bodies of water in the United States are governed by the Inland Navigation Rules or their state law equivalents. These "rules" are typically referred to as the "rules of the road."&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their affordability, ease of use, and relatively low transportation and maintenance costs, personal watercraft have significantly increased the number of water-based enthusiasts in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This rise in participation has created conflicts between the various boating segments in the U.S. and a need for additional boater education. Recreational-boating accidents are the second-largest transportation-related cause of injury in the U.S. (after automobile accidents).&lt;ref name=accidents&gt;NTSB Boating Safety Report (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|PWC}}Background ==
Personal watercraft are vessels designed for recreational use on the water, carrying between one and four passengers. The [[U.S. Coast Guard]] defines PWC as "craft less than 13 feet in length designed to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing or kneeling on the craft rather than within the confines of a hull".&lt;ref name=osix&gt;"Boating Statistics 2006." {{cite web |url=http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/Boating_Statistics_2006.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902191629/http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/boating_statistics_2006.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-02 |df= }} Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The original PWCs were manufactured during the mid-1950s in the United Kingdom and Europe. Ten years later Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP) began manufacturing PWC's in the USA under the name [[Sea-Doo (disambiguation)|Sea-Doo]]. BRP left the PWC business shortly thereafter, and in 1973 Kawasaki introduced a "stand-up" watercraft designed for a single operator (with a tray for standing or kneeling, in place of a seat). By the late 1980s "sit-down" models had appeared on the market, allowing the rider to be seated (similar to a [[snowmobile]] or motorcycle seat). These sit-down models were made by Kawasaki (1986), [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] (1987) and BRP (1988). Polaris and Arctic were two American companies which entered the market during the early 1990s.

PWC have an [[Inboard motor|inboard engine]] with a screw-shaped [[impeller]] to create [[thrust]] and [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] for steering. They are small, fast, and easy to maneuver; PWCs do not use external [[Propeller (marine)|propellers]], making them safer for swimmers and wildlife. The [[Usability|user-friendly]] properties of PWCs have contributed to the increase in popularity amongst less-experienced watercraft users. To increase safety, a number of U.S. [[Consumer organization|consumer groups]] suggested that all boats should utilize the jet-drive mechanism (also called a [[pump-jet]]) employed by PWC manufacturers since this would reduce the risk of propeller injuries.&lt;ref name=prop&gt;The Coast Guard's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for houseboats provided that houseboats should either have a propeller guard installed or be converted to jet drive power.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents ==
All boating accidents in the United States either occur on state- or federally-patrolled waters.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Whether state or federal, reports must be filed for a predefined level of damage and are compiled by the [[United States Coast Guard]] (which uses the reported data for its annual BAR—Boating Accident Report—Statistical Reports). As automotive [[Law enforcement officer#United States|law-enforcement officers]] outnumber [[Water police#List of water police units|boating law-enforcement officers]] in the U.S., federal government reports for watercraft are comparatively fewer.&lt;ref name=rept&gt;As a general rule of thumb the Coast Guard believes that it receives about 10% of the "property damage only" accidents, but 90% of the serious personal injury accidents.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Transportation Safety Board|National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)]] conducted general investigation of the recreational-boating accident-reporting system in 1998 and compiled its findings in a published report.&lt;ref name=invt&gt;National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998. http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/8000/8400/8418/SS9801.pdf Retrieved on December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The NTSB's investigation emerged with data seen as representative of overall recreational boating; an example follows from the report's conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inattention (attributed to 307 operators), inexperience (attributed to 296 operators), and inappropriate speed for the operating conditions (attributed to 246 operators) were the most frequently cited causes that contributed to the PWC accidents. One or more of these three causes were associated with 70 percent of the 814 accidents. A fourth cause, improper lookout (153), was associated with about one-fifth of the accidents.&lt;ref name=causes&gt;Page 18-19 of NTSB Report (1998). This results in 90% of all accidents being attributed to improper lookout, inexperience, inappropriate speed and inattention. The remaining 10% of the accidents were mostly due to rules of the road infractions, weather or environmental conditions and other "unknown" causes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the aforementioned interpretation of the NTSB report: 
* The vast majority of accidents (over 90 percent) were caused by operator error.
* There is a significantly higher association with accidents for rental operators (nearly 25 percent) than is the case for the general boating population; however, this may be related to the higher percentage of rental operators.&lt;ref name=edu&gt;"The Safety Board is concerned about persons who rent PWC. Nearly one-quarter of the PWC operators involved in the 1997 accidents analyzed by the Safety Board for this study (292 of 1,218, or 24 percent) were operating rented PWC" NTSB Report (page 33)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The NTSB report did not conclude that PWCs are disproportionately represented in boating-accident statistics.&lt;ref name=accd&gt;"The study was not designed to estimate how often PWC accidents occur, nor are the results of the study necessarily representative of all PWC accidents". Page i.
"However, in 1994 the number of PWC fatalities began to increase noticeably because the number of PWCs in operation increased". Page v.
"The increase in PWC fatalities is proportional to the increase of PWC in operation." Page 2.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A study performed by the Red Cross in 1991 concluded that during the research period, PWC accidents were not disproportionate to their use by the boating population. This was later supported by a Coast Guard study presented to the State of Vermont in 1996. Both studies presented findings that the comparative accident rates for personal water craft were not [[wikt:disproportionate|disproportionate]] to their use by the boating population; the reports emphasized the high level of attention and publicity that PWC accidents receive.&lt;ref name=rates&gt;There is a difference between comparing the number accidents to the number of registrations, as opposed to comparing the number of accidents to the actual hours of use of the boats. Large yachts, which spend most of their time sitting at the marina, are less at risk of an accident due to the low hours of use.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s, several states (including [[California]] and [[Florida]], two [[wikt:jurisdiction|jurisdictions]] which, according to the NTSB report, accounted for over 50 percent of all personal-water-craft accidents in the U.S.) changed their laws regarding the use of personal water craft. These amendments included the introduction of limits for [[wake]]-jumping, the prescribed use of a PWC within {{convert|100|ft|m}} of another vessel, "spraying" activities,{{clarify|date=May 2012}} mandated operation of PWCs within {{convert|150|ft|m}} of the shoreline, and age restrictions for operators (the operator age was raised from 12 to 16 years for all affected states, with Florida also introducing a mandatory boating-safety course for those under age 18).&lt;ref name=sfty&gt;National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the State of California, these laws have directly contributed to an over-50-percent reduction in accidents.&lt;ref name=cali&gt;See footnotes to accident discussion below. California Boating and Waterways 2004 Annual Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable fatality occurred on July 1, 2012 in Little Sabine Bay (near [[Pensacola Beach]]), [[Florida]]; retired [[astronaut]] [[Alan Poindexter]] was killed when the PWC he was riding was rammed by one operated by one of his sons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48043840/ns/today-today_tech/t/ex-astronaut-alan-poindexter-dies-jet-ski-accident/#.T_cxrtWLM4Q Ex-astronaut Alan Poindexter dies in jet ski accident]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

=== {{anchor|Reckless Driving}}Reckless driving ===
The leading cause of PWC accidents among riders in 2007 was reckless or careless driving.&lt;ref name=oseven&gt;"Boating Statistics 2006." http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/Boating_Statistics_2007.pdf. Retrieved on December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Transportation Safety Board in the U.S., this accounted for 26.3 percent of all PWCs involved in accidents in 2007.&lt;ref name=ntsb&gt;"National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998. [http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/8000/8400/8418/SS9801.pdf] Retrieved on December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Reckless driving has been defined in the Personal Watercraft Act of 2005 in the U.S. as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Every personal watercraft shall at all times be operated in a reasonable and prudent manner. No person shall operate a personal watercraft in an unsafe or reckless manner. Unsafe personal watercraft operation shall include, but not be limited to the following:&lt;br /&gt;
 (1) Becoming airborne or completely leaving the water while crossing the wake of another vessel within [100 feet] of the vessel creating the wake. &lt;br /&gt;Or wake jumping
      (2) Weaving through congested traffic.&lt;br /&gt;
      (3) Operating a vessel at greater than slow/no wake speed within [100 feet] of an anchored or moored vessel, shoreline, vessel underway, dock, pier, boat ramp, marina, swim float, marked swim area, person in the water, person(s) engaged in angling, or any {{Sic|?|hide=y|manually|-}}propelled vessel. &lt;br /&gt;
      (4) Operating contrary to the "Rules of the Road" or following too close to another vessel, including another personal watercraft. For the purposes of this section, following too close shall be construed as proceeding in the same direction and operating at a speed in excess of [10 MPH] when approaching within [100 feet] to the rear or [50 feet] to the side of another motorboat or sailboat which is underway unless such vessel is operating in a narrow channel, in which case a personal watercraft may operate at speed and flow of other vessel traffic.&lt;ref name=nasbla&gt;NASBLA MODEL ACT FOR PERSONAL WATERCRAFT http://www.nasbla.net/pdf/Model%20Acts/new/Personal%20Watercraft%2092105.pdf. Retrieved on December 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reckless driving is defined differently by state. For example, in Florida reckless driving on a PWC is defined as "maneuvering a personal watercraft by weaving through congested vessel traffic, jumping the wake of another vessel unreasonably close or when visibility around the vessel is obstructed, or swerving at the last possible moment to avoid collision is classified as reckless operation of a vessel".&lt;ref name=florida&gt;Florida Boating Laws Basic. http://www.boatus.org/onlinecourse/statelaws/Florida.html. Retrieved on December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In U.S. law, the penalties for operating a vessel in a negligent or reckless manner are defined as following:&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) A person operating a vessel in a negligent manner or interfering with the safe operation of a vessel, so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of a person is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 in the case of a recreational vessel, or $25,000 in the case of any other vessel.&lt;br /&gt;
(b) A person operating a vessel in a grossly negligent manner that endangers the life, limb, or property of a person commits a class A misdemeanor.&lt;ref name=code&gt;"U.S. Code: Penalties for negligent operations and interfering with safe operation." https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/2302-. Retrieved on December 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|Driver Inattention}}Driver inattention ===
Because of the increasing popularity of water sports (particularly PWC), the number of vessels in use has increased in the last several decades. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the number of registered vessels was 8,557,857 in 1980 and 12,875,568 in 2007.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt; This has resulted in more-crowded waterways and increased hazards. Because of the increased congestion caused by the number of vessels, a heightened need for attention and caution is required by operators. In 2007, 17.2 percent of all PWC-related accidents were caused by driver inattention.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Excessive Speed}}Excessive speed ===
As the market has grown for PWC manufacturers, vessel power has also increased. Modern PWC engines have more than 250 horsepower and can reach speeds of over {{convert|70|mph}}.&lt;ref name=wave&gt;Yamaha Waverunner. http://www.yamaha-motor.com/waverunner/products/modelhome/580/0/home.aspx. Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive speed accounted for nearly 15 percent of all PWC-related accidents in 2007, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Off Throttle Steering}}Off-throttle steering ===
The steering characteristics of jet boats (including personal watercraft) when they are "off throttle" seem to differ from conventional steering. All recreational planing boats steer with thrust. Jet boats (including PWCs) generate that thrust with a moveable nozzle connected to a jet pump; propeller boats generate thrust through a downward-placed, exposed propeller. The fact that the propeller is placed downward in the water and is exposed means that even when it is not generating thrust that some amount of steering effect is possible. Jet boats have no downward projection, and achieve no additional steering effect from the device. If the operator of a jet boat releases the throttle, steering effectiveness decreases roughly in proportion to  thrust reduction. The NTSB related an example of an off-throttle steering accident in the personal watercraft safety study of 1998: &lt;blockquote&gt;
The Florida Marine Patrol accident description states, "[Operator] was
attempting to make a turn south through a cut in the mangroves . . . . He was not real familiar with operating a jet ski with a passenger.  When he attempted to make a left turn he let off the throttle which caused the PWC to lose steering capabilities.  The forward momentum of the PWC took [operator] and passenger into the mangrove shoreline.
[Operator] received a puncture wound to the left side of his neck . . . ."&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the NTSB, 24 percent of reported PWC accidents list steering problems or loss of control as contributing factors;&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt; in Florida, it is the second-leading cause of PWC-related accidents. PWC manufacturers have been working to develop a system to prevent off-throttle steering. Modifications have been made to solve this problem in newer PWC models.&lt;ref name=rideo&gt;Ride Technology: Off Throttle Steering http://www.ridetechnology.com/offThrottle.html. Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Driver inexperience}}Driver inexperience ===
Because of the ease of operating a PWC, little training and experience is required to perform basic maneuvers of a PWC. The NTSB reported in 1998 that 32 percent of operators involved in accidents reported that they had operated a vessel between zero and ten times prior to the accident; 86 never, 75 once and 225 between 2 and 10 times. Of the 712 operators who were asked about training, 84 percent said they had received no training and the other 16 percent participated in some boating training.&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt; Regulations concerning training courses and age limits for operators vary by state and by country. In the U.S. the minimum operator age ranges from 12–18 years; young operators may require adult supervision on the vessel and training in accordance with local laws.&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Conclusion}}Internal Orifice Injuries ===

One particularly serious type of personal watercraft injury occurs when a female rider falls off the back of the craft and into the path of the craft's high-pressure water jet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insiderexclusive.com/justice-in-america/dangerous-sports-the-personal-watercraft-industry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|title=www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|last=Mazzola|first=Brian|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The jet thrust is powerful enough to push water into the rider's orifices, which can result in severe internal injuries to the rider's vagina, rectum or anus, and possibly death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insiderexclusive.com/justice-in-america/dangerous-sports-the-personal-watercraft-industry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|title=www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|last=Mazzola|first=Brian|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2014, the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District, Division One upheld in full a [[San Diego County]] jury verdict against [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] and two other defendants in favor of two plaintiffs injured simultaneously in a single 2007 fall from a PWC, which included awards, respectively, of $3.385 million and $1.063 million in compensatory damages (with liability divided in equal portions among the three defendants).&lt;ref name="Colombo"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17317476377459507274 ''Colombo v. BRP US Inc.''], 230 Cal. App. 4th 1442; 179 Cal. Rptr. 3d 580 (2014).  As the appellate court explained in its opinion, this case was delayed after the PWC owner initiated a proceeding in federal court under the [[Limitation of Liability Act of 1851]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The appellate court also affirmed awards of $1.5 million in punitive damages against BRP alone for each plaintiff (adding up to $3 million in punitive damages) which were based on the jury's express finding that BRP's conduct manifested a "reckless or callous disregard for the rights of others".&lt;ref name="Colombo" /&gt;

However, on the other hand, there are also examples where the owner, operator, and/or user of the personal watercraft have been found entirely at fault by a jury without any fault whatsoever on the manufacturer.  For example, in 2010 in a case venued in the federal court of the Middle District of Florida, a jury found the 2006 Sea-Doo safe and not defective as to design, warnings, manufacture, and that BRP was not negligent in the design of its product.  &lt;ref&gt;See Christina Thomas v. Bombardier Recreational Products, Inc., CASE NO.: 2:07-CV-00730-JES-SPC (M.D. Fla. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  BRP maintained the Sea-Doo was reasonably safe, state-of-the-art, compliant with industry standards as well as the U.S. Coast Guard's standards, and was not the cause of plaintiff's injuries and/or accident.  The plaintiff testified she did not have any conversation with anyone concerning the use of protective gear, such as wet suit bottoms or equivalent protective clothing and was not provided any safety information before riding. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rumberger.com/?t=40&amp;an=4502&amp;format=xml&amp;p=4944&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, the operator admitted he saw, but chose not to read, the onboard warning label. He also admitted that he did not read the safety recommendations in the operator’s guide nor watch the safety video.  Counsel for BRP in the Thomas case, Scott Sarason, commented on the case that, “Statistically speaking, the probability of the type of incident involved in this case is extremely rare. Owners, operators and passengers of personal watercrafts must think safety first. It’s important for people to realize that these watercraft are classified as boats. That’s why the watercraft industry has been working diligently with authorities like the U.S. Coast Guard to introduce programs like ‘Know Before You Go’ in an effort to prevent accidents and injuries.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rumberger.com/?t=40&amp;an=4502&amp;format=xml&amp;p=4944&lt;/ref&gt; The Thomas case is just one example, of a handful, where such a rare accident is caused by extraneous persons or factors (including, but not limited to, the presence of alcohol, operator inexperience/inattention, careless or reckless operation, violation of state/local boating laws, failure on the part of the operator and/or owner to convey necessary safety information provided by the manufacturer, etc.).

He studied classical music with Komter Loeber in [[Blaricum]] in the Netherlands from 1962–72. Then he studied jazz music with [[Terry Trotter]] and Lazlo Cser in Los Angeles in 1979. His earliest influences include [[Oscar Peterson]], [[McCoy Tyner]] and [[Bill Evans]]. 

Over the years pianist René has recorded and produced for many different labels, such as Virgin, Timeless, WEA, Dureco,  Zebra Acoustic, Pacific Music, Turning Point records, Munich Records, demajors Independent Music Industry Jakarta and his own labels: Relukreul records, and Helsdingen Music, The Netherlands. Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterised him as "A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity. René allows himself a few extended workouts and avoids the trap of repeating himself or overstating his case."&lt;ref&gt;The Age, Melbourne, 23 Dec. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Helsdingen has organized many successful tours, projects and festivals sponsored by ngo’s , governmental institutions, companies to which he was responsible with regard to the control over the budgets made available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5777">'''Bruce Robert Isabell''' (June 2, 1952 &amp;ndash; July 8, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[Event planning|event planner]] who was behind lavish and innovative events including weddings and funerals of the richest and most famous. He helped make Christmas at the [[White House]] during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]] and helped create innovative events that made [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]] into the place to be in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Isabell was born in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where he worked in a flower shop as a youth. After graduating from high school he moved to [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/nyregion/11isabell.html "Robert Isabell, Who Turned Events Into Wondrous Occasions, Dies at 57"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 10, 2009. Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1970s and was hired by [[Ian Schrager]] at [[Studio 54]], after Schrager had seen the creative designs Isabell had developed while he was working for event planner Renny Reynolds who had done work at the club and was the leading planner in his day. Schrager described how Isabell "never tried to do too much, it was never design on steroids, yet there was always the razzle-dazzle".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He started on his own operating a floral shop within [[Bergdorf Goodman]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. He established "a full-service event-production house" in the city's [[West Village]] where he would oversee the creation of events around the world, in which the entire setting including flowers, lighting, sound and table decorations would be part of his craft. [[Anna Wintour]] of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine described him as "the king of the event world" who was "a magician"&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt; and the first person that top hostesses would approach to create spectacular events. Isabell created roughly 30 events for writer and editor [[Tina Brown]]. She regarded him as "sort of a genius" who had the ability to "take any space and make magic in it".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For over a decade, he designed the annual [[Met Ball]] for ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name=TCBG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/shopping/fashion/features/11894/|title=The Charity Ball Game|accessdate=2011-05-04|date=2005-05-21|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, he had four tons of [[glitter]] dumped on the floor of [[Studio 54]] for a New Year's Eve event, with club co-owner Ian Schrager describing how guests felt "like you were standing on stardust".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Bracketed between the 1986 wedding of [[Edwin Schlossberg]] to [[Caroline Kennedy]] and the 1996 nuptials of [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] and [[Carolyn Bessette]], he worked on the 1994 funeral of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For the July 1995 wedding of billionaire [[Robert Warren Miller]]'s daughter [[Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece|Marie-Chantal]] to [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece]] at [[Saint Sophia (London)|Saint Sophia]] in [[Bayswater]], [[London]], Isabell created a virtual Greek temple in a tent, including pillars topped with roses, with a budget variously estimated at $5–8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Bob.

Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For the wedding of [[Alexandra von Fürstenberg]], Marie-Chantal's sister, to Prince Alexandre Egon von Fürstenberg, son of [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], Isabell transformed a tent in [[Battery Park]] into a Chinese teahouse complete with a throne room that included hanging lanterns and bamboo trees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzy Menkes|Menkes, Suzy]].

A resident of [[Manhattan]]'s [[Greenwich Village]], Isabell was found dead on July 8, 2009, aged 57, in his townhouse at 16 Minetta Lane, where he had suffered a fatal [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack). He is survived by his mother, two brothers and a sister.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''''The Sound of Music Live!''''' is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by NBC on December 5, 2013. Produced by [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], the special was an adaptation of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. The television special starred [[country music|country]] singer and ''[[American Idol]]'' winner [[Carrie Underwood]] as [[Maria von Trapp]], and was performed and televised [[live television|live]] from [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]].

Spearheaded by NBC chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]], the network positioned the special as being a live [[event television|television "event"]]. In preparing for the broadcast, Meron and Zadan emphasized the logistical challenges that they would face due to the live aspects of the special, and the fact that ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was an adaptation based on the musical itself and not the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]]. Meron felt that if the telecast were successful, the concept could become "another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." By her request, Underwood's casting as Maria was personally endorsed by [[Julie Andrews]], who starred in the 1965 film.

The production was met with mixed reviews; much of its criticism was directed towards the casting of Carrie Underwood to play Maria, whom critics (including the real-life [[von Trapp family]]) believed was not experienced enough in theatre to portray such an iconic role. While her vocal performance was praised, her acting was described by critics as "amateur", "lifeless" and lacking emotion. The production was a ratings success for NBC; with a total of 18.62 million live viewers, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' brought the network its highest Thursday night viewership for an entertainment program since the [[Goodnight, Seattle|series finale]] of ''[[Frasier (TV series)|Frasier]]'' in 2004, and prompted NBC to sign Zadan and Meron on to produce more live musicals for the network in the future.

==Plot==
Maria Rainer, a [[postulant]] at [[Nonnberg Abbey]] in [[Salzburg]], is contemplating the day she has spent in the mountains ("The Sound of Music").  When she returns to the Abbey, she learns from the Mother Abbess that she is to be the new governess for the von Trappe children.  Before she leaves the Abbey, Mother Abbess asks her to teach her the song that she's always singing ("My Favorite Things"). When Maria arrives at the von Trappe house, she is greeted coldly by the Captain and introduced to the children, who enter with military precision. Maria  finds that the Captain has emotionally closed himself off since the death of his wife and decides to teach his children the basics of singing to gain their trust and acceptance.

A month, later the captain returns home with Elsa Schraeder, whom he is courting, and their friend Max Detweiler, who is looking for the perfect local singing group to perform at the annual Kaltzberg Festival. When his children arrive dressed in clothes Maria had made from her old bedroom curtains he is outraged and embarrassed. Maria then confronts him and tells him how he does not know or understand his children and that they need him but this only upsets him more and he orders her to return to Nonnberg Abbey. However, upon hearing his children sing to Schraeder, his eyes are open to the truth Maria had been speaking and he embraces his children and ask Maria to stay on as governess.

He then throws a grand party for Schraeder and when the band plays the [[Ländler]], the captain's youngest son asks Maria to teach him the dance and the captain steps in to help. As the two dance an unspoken attraction begins to arise in the two and Maria puts a stop to the dancing. However, this unspoken attraction did not go unnoticed by Brigitta who confronts Maria on this. Though Maria strongly denies it she begins to realize that Brigitta is telling the truth. Then, Schraeder calls the children out to say good night to the guests and Max is instantly smitten with the idea to have the children sing in the festival and during all the hustle and bustle Maria sneaks off unnoticed and returns to the Abbey, where she confides in the Mother Abbess that she has fallen in love with the captain but that she is ready to take the orders of [[poverty, obedience and chastity]]. The Mother Abbess denies her this and encourages her to take face her problem head-on and to find the life she was born to live.

Maria then returns to the von Trapp home and is warmly greeted by the children, who no longer feel the joys of singing due to her sudden departure. When she finds out that the captain intends to marry Schraeder she decides to see her duties through until arrangements can be made for a new governess. However, the political differences between Schraeder and the captain cause the two to realize that they have no future together and she leaves. Meanwhile, the captain confronts Maria and the two admit their feelings for each other. The two agree to marry at the Abbey and while the two are on honeymoon, [[Anschluss|Germany invades Austria]].

When they return, the captain is ordered to accept a commission in the German Navy and report immediately to [[Bremerhaven]]. Maria, thinking quickly, hands the Admiral the program for the Kaltzberg Festival showing that the von Trapp Family Singers are scheduled to perform, so the captain couldn’t possibly leave right away. They are granted permission to perform. During the finale, Max announces that a guard of honor is waiting to escort the captain away as soon as the concert is over. Maria leads the family in one more song to which they escape to one by one and flee to the Abbey. The Nazi soldiers search the Abbey for the von Trapps to no avail, as the family decides to flee Austria over the mountains with Maria's help.&lt;ref name="Synopsis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/the-sound-of-music-%E2%80%93-music-from-the-nbc-television-event-2013|title=The Sound of Music – Music from the NBC Television Event 2013|work=[[Masterworks Broadway]]|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and promotion==
On June 30, 2012, NBC's chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]] announced the network's plans to broadcast a live adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-News-NBC-Craig-ZadanNeil-Meron-to-Present-Live-Broadcast-of-THE-SOUND-OF-MUSIC-20120629#ixzz2CoUEezC5|title=NBC &amp; Craig Zadan/Neil Meron to Present Live Broadcast of THE SOUND OF MUSIC!|author=BWW News Desk|date=June 30, 2012|work=''broadwayworld.com''|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 2012, the network announced that [[country music]] and [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', winner performer Carrie Underwood would star as Maria von Trapp in the production.

Produced on a budget of around $9 million, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was broadcast live from a soundstage built at Grumman Studios in [[Bethpage, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/carrie-underwood-s-sound-of-music-special-to-air-live-from-bethpage-1.6528060|title=Carrie Underwood's 'Sound of Music' special to air live from Bethpage|last1=Amodio|first1=Joseph|date=December 2, 2013|website=[[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC, as well as producers [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], emphasized that the production was not a remake of the film, but an adaptation of the musical itself; Meron iterated that "the audience will discover, within the first few minutes of watching the show, that they are not seeing a TV version of the movie. They'll know right away it's ''The Sound of Music'', but it's a different ''Sound of Music'' than they are accustomed to seeing on film." Meron felt that if successful, the broadcast could "open the door to another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." He also praised the involvement of Underwood as the star of the production, believing that she was a quick learner, and "has all of the qualities of Maria." Greenblatt was highly supportive of the project, as he was, in the words of Zadan, a "passionate devotee of theater". Zadan considered the production to be "one of the profoundly complicated, amazing experiences we’ve ever had", noting the additional challenges created by the live broadcast.&lt;ref name=variety-smlcomplex&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live’: Producers Call It a ‘Profoundly Complicated, Amazing Experience’|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/sound-of-music-live-a-profoundly-complicated-amazing-experience-1200925997/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thq-somliveproduction&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC's 'Sound of Music' Producers on Live Show Fears and Big Expectations (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbcs-sound-music-producers-live-661941|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]| last=Ng|first=Philiana|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted by NBC as a "three-hour holiday event",&lt;ref name="Bricker"/&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was aired as part of a push by NBC to air more live entertainment specials. Among its most popular programs in recent years have been those with live components (such as ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''); NBC's Jennifer Salke believed that the increased level of [[social networking service|social network]] interaction possible in a live broadcast, along with the feeling of being part of an "event", would encourage viewers to watch the special live instead of [[Video on-demand|on-demand]] or from a recording. NBC's previous attempt at event television, ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', was met with mixed reviews and viewership, but NBC did indicate that [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s advertising throughout the series brought a higher level of [[Brand awareness|awareness]] to the brand.&lt;ref name=adage-nbclive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Plots Aggressive Live Programming Strategy|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-plots-aggressive-live-programming-strategy/245473/|work=[[AdAge]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|last=Poggi|first=Jeanine|date=December 2, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television special was also the first live musical special in almost fifty years on NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=The Sound of Music: Music from the NBC Television Event|type=[[Compact disc]] [[liner notes]]|year=2013|publisher=[[Sony Masterworks|Masterworks]]|page=7|id=88843 79814 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail chain [[Walmart]] served as the presenting sponsor for ''The Sound of Music Live!''. NBC also produced five themed Walmart commercials to air throughout the special, featuring scenes of a family using products from the store set to songs from ''The Sound of Music''. The five ads were timed to air during the commercial break following the scene where the song was featured; NBC's advertising chief Dan Lovinger considered the ads to be a way to "enhance the excitement" of the presentation for families.&lt;ref name=variety-walmartads&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart Ads for NBC’s "Sound of Music" Will Sound Just Like the Show|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/walmart-ads-for-nbcs-sound-of-music-will-sound-just-like-the-show-1200922060/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Prior to the broadcast, members of the real-life von Trapp family were critical of casting Underwood to play Maria, agreeing with the notion that she would be a good singer but a poor actor. They suggested that [[Anne Hathaway]], who played [[Fantine]] in the [[Les Misérables (2012 film)|2012 film adaptation]] of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], would have been a better choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothman|first=Michael|title=Who the Von Trapps Wish Could Replace Carrie Underwood in ‘The Sound of Music Live’|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/12/who-the-von-trapps-wish-could-replace-carrie-underwood-in-the-sound-of-music-live/|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' received mixed reviews from entertainment critics, commending the show for its scope and supporting cast while questioning Underwood's acting capabilities.

Kevin Fallon of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote: "Naturally, Underwood sounded astounding, as alive as those damned hills, every time she was asked to stand on top of things and belt. But whether it was because of nerves or lack of experience, her acting was painfully lifeless and amateur throughout the first two thirds of the lengthy ordeal. The singer, it seems, is a proud graduate of the school of 'If I don't blink, they'll think I'm acting!'"&lt;ref name=db-somlreview&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live!’ Review: The Hills Are Barely Alive| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-review-the-hills-are-barely-alive.html|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]]|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verne Gay of ''[[Newsday]]'' liked Underwood's performance, commenting that not only could she sing, but "she is a luminous stage presence who had the guts to take on one of the most iconic roles of the stage or screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/columnists/verne-gay/sound-of-music-and-carrie-underwood-largely-a-success-1.6550556|title = 'Sound of Music' -- and Carrie Underwood -- largely a success|date = December 5, 2013|accessdate =December 6, 2013|work = [[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|last = Gay|first = Verne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the production "as lifeless as [its] alpine backdrops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV Review: '' 'The Sound of Music Live!'

He also panned Moyer, criticizing his vocal performance and describing "his attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness" as "mildly constipated" and "clenched." However, he lauded Benanti, Borle and McDonald's "strong" performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sound-music-live-tv-review-663346|title = The Sound of Music Live!: TV Review|date =December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|last = Bernardin|first = Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC's Bob Greenblatt considered the production to be a success, and signed Meron and Zadan to produce another live musical for the 2014 holiday season. Greenblatt felt that there were enough recognizable, family-friendly musicals to make events like ''The Sound of Music Live!'' an annual tradition, and he indicated that NBC received e-mails and phone calls from various theatrical rightsholders, expressing interest in having their musicals adapted in a similar fashion, In January 2014, NBC announced that it would broadcast a live version of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' in December 2014, and at NBC's [[upfronts]] in May 2014, Greenblatt announced that NBC had also obtained rights to produce an adaptation of ''[[The Music Man]]'', although the network did not announce any timeframe for the production.&lt;ref name=nyt-morelive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Says It Will Put On a Show, Again| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/arts/television/a-network-is-buoyed-by-sound-of-music-ratings.html?ref=television&amp;_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-nbcmusicman&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Announces 'Music Man' Live TV Production|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6084818/nbc-announces-music-man-live-tv-production|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frizell |first=Sam |date=January 19, 2014 |title=NBC Announces ''Peter Pan'' for Next Live Production |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/01/19/nbc-announces-peter-pan-for-next-live-production/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that ''The Music Man'' project was put on hold for a live performance of ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/30/wiz-nbc The Wiz is NBC's next live musical] Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved October 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the concept also spread to competing networks: in April 2014, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] announced that it would produce a [[Grease: Live|live production]] of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', which aired in January 2016.&lt;ref name=billboard-foxgrease&gt;{{cite web|title='Grease' Live Coming to Fox TV|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070137/grease-live-coming-to-fox-tv|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC aired ''[[Hairspray Live!]]'' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

The special also had an influence on viewership for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s annual broadcast of the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]] of ''The Sound of Music''; with 6.5 million viewers and a 1.3 share, it was ABC's highest-rated airing of the film since 2007, although it was beaten by NBC's ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref name=deadline-ratings/&gt;

[[File:Thevar Jayanthi in Madurai, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|Garlanding Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar's statue in [[Madurai]] during the 2007 Thevar Jayanthi centenary]]'''''Thevar Jayanthi''''', celebrated on 30 October, is an annual commemoration of the birthday of [[U. Muthuramalingam Thevar|Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar]]. It is celebrated in a grand way by the [[Thevar]] community in the southern districts of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/oct/28tn1.htm |title=Security beefed up in Madurai for Thevar Jayanthi |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an official public holiday, many schools and businesses in the area remain closed on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/31/stories/2006103105270300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/31/stories/2005103116560300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions pass off peacefully |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2005 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/31/stories/2007103159910300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thevar's legacy==
Whilst having been active in politics, it is mainly the spiritual discourse of Thevar that explains his following after his death. Also, the fact that his date of birth and death lie some close to each other has been interpreted as a sign of supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="s"/&gt;

==Thevar Samadhi==
One of the main events on Thevar Jayanthi takes place at the ''samadhi'' (burial place) of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar, located at some 50 miles distance from [[Madurai]]. Pilgrims gather to take part in the ceremonies at the ''samadhi'' on 30 October. In later years the ceremony at the ''samadhi'' has begun to attract prominent politicians.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;Robinson, Rowena. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2cIOqGcvHqoC&amp;pg=PA167 Sociology of Religion in India]''. New Delhi [u.a.]: SAGE, 2004. pp. 165-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversy==
The [[All India Forward Bloc]], the [[political party]] to which Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar belonged, has demanded that Thevar Jayanthi be declared a public holiday in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/ar_showdetails.asp?id=710090655&amp;cat=&amp;n_date=20071009 |title=Mid term polls linked to Cong stand on US nuke pact: AIFB|publisher=webindia123.com |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is not entirely uncontroversial. The [[CPI(ML) Liberation]] has charged that the Tamil Nadu government should stop sponsoring Thevar Jayanthi celebrations, claiming that the event is utilised by [[caste]]ist forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2009/jan_09/reports.html |title=Kerala : Land Reforms Undone |publisher=[[Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation]]|date= |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 centenary celebrations==
On 30 October 2007, the birth centenary of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar was celebrated. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[M. Karunanidhi]] took part in the celebrations in [[Pasumpon]] village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/10/30/karunanidhi-jaya-pay-floral-tributes-to-muthuramalinga-thevar-1193737346.html |title=Karunanidhi, Jaya pay floral tributes to Muthuramalinga Thevar|publisher=[[Oneindia.in]]|date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in two decades that Karunanidhi participated in Thevar Jayanthi.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; At the celebrations, Karunanidhi suggested that [[Madurai Airport]] be renamed after Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar. These moves were seen as an attempt by Karunanidhi's [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) party to challenge the supremacy of the rival [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) over the Thevar community. The AIADMK leader [[J. Jayalalitha]] criticised Karunanidhi's participation in the Thevar Jayanthi centenary programme, stating that he did not believe in Thevar's ideas. Moreover, she claimed that her previous government had allocated 30&amp;nbsp;million [[Indian rupee|rupees]] for the Thevar Jayanthi centenary, but that Karunanidhi's government had spent only five million rupees.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianchristians.in/news/content/view/1732/48/ |title=New Icon, Old Wounds |publisher=All India Christian Council|date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''To the Last Man: A Story of the Pleasant Valley War''''' is a western novel written by [[Zane Grey]].

==Origin==
''To The Last Man'' is a shorter version of ''[[Tonto Basin (novel)|Tonto Basin]]''. Grey submitted the manuscript of ''Tonto Basin'' to the magazine ''The Country Gentleman,'' which published it in serialization as ''To the Last Man'' from May 28, 1921 through July 30, 1921. This was a much shorter version of the  original leaving out much of the [[backstory]]. This shorter version was published by [[Harper Brothers]].

==Plot introduction==
It is a story of a family feud healed by young love.  The story is based on a factual event involving the notorious Hashknife gang of Northern Arizona.

==Plot summary==
The story follows an ancient feud between two frontier families that is inflamed
when one of the families takes up cattle rustling.

The ranchers are led by Jean Isbel and, on the other side, Lee Jorth and his band of cattle rustlers.

In the grip of a relentless code of loyalty to their own people, they fight the war of the Tonto Basin, desperately, doggedly, to the last man, neither side seeing the futility of it until it is too late. And in this volatile environment, young Jean finds himself hopelessly in love with a girl from whom he is separated by an impassable barrier.

==Characters in "To the Last Man"==
*Jean Isbel &amp;ndash; Jean Isbel is a woodsman from Oregon drawn into the Tonto Basin feud by his father, Gaston Isbel. He has the reputation of being an excellent tracker and fighter. He is born from Gaston's second wife, who was Native American. He is in love with Ellen Jorth.

The term '''use error''' has recently been introduced to replace the commonly used terms '''[[human error]]''' and '''[[user error]]'''. The new term, which has already been adopted by [[international standard]]s organizations for [[medical device]]s (see [[#Use errors in health care]] below for references), suggests that [[accident]]s should be attributed to the circumstances, rather than to the human beings who happened to be there.

==The need for the terminological change==
The term "use error" was first used in May 1995 in an [[MD+DI]] guest editorial,  [http://www.mddionline.com/article/issue-use-not-user-error “The Issue Is ‘Use,’ Not ‘User,’ Error,”] by [http://biomed.tamu.edu/people/faculty.php?lname=Hyman William Hyman].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mddionline.com/article/issue-use-not-user-error&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, human errors are considered as a special aspect of [[human factors]]. Accordingly, they are attributed to the human [[Computer operator|operator]], or [[user (computing)|user]].
When taking this approach, we assume that the system design is perfect, and the only source for the use errors is the human operator. For example, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) [[HFACS]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://uscg.mil/careercentral/cg113/docs/ergo_hfacs/hfacs.pdf], Department of Defense Human Factors Analysis and Classification System: A mishap investigation and data analysis tool&lt;/ref&gt; 
classifies use errors attributed to the human operator, disregarding improper design and configuration setting, which often result in missing [[alarms]], or in inappropriate [[alert messaging|alerting]].

The need for changing the term was due to a common [[malpractice]] of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s (the responsible organizations, the authorities, journalists) in cases of accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lu.se/upload/Trafikflyghogskolan/TR2002-01_ReInventionofHumanError.pdf], Dekker: Reinvention of Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of investing in fixing the error-prone design, management attributed the error to the users.
The need for the change has been pointed out by the accident investigators: 
* Early in 1983, Erik Hollnagel&lt;ref&gt;
[https://sites.google.com/site/erikhollnagel2/], Erik Hollnagel home page
&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the term Human Error refers to the outcome, not to the cause. A user action is typically classified as an error only if the results are painful &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ida.liu.se/~eriho/Bellagio_M.htm], Hollnagel: Why "Human Error" is a Meaningless Concept&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the story “Leap of Faith” of his book “Set Phasers on Stun”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegeanpublishing.com/phaser1.html], Steve Casey: Set Phasers on Stun&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Casey suggested that the accident of the [[Indian Airlines Flight 605]] near Bangalor in 1990 could have been avoided, should the investigators of the [[Air France Flight 296]] accident of 1988 past the Mulhouse-Habsheim airport considered the circumstances (exceptional situation), rather than the pilots (human errors).
* In his book “Managing the Risks of Organizational Accidents” ([[Organizational models of accidents]]) James Reason explained and demonstrated that often, the circumstances for accidents could have been controlled by the responsible organization, and not by the operators. 
* In his book “The Field Guide to Understanding Human Errors”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754648260],  Sidney Dekker:  The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Dekker argued that blaming the operators according to “The Old View” results in defensive behavior of operators, which hampers the efforts to learn from near-misses and from accidents.

==Use errors vs. force majeure==
A mishap is typically considered as either a use error or a force majeure:
&lt;ref name="Weiler"&gt;[http://avi.har-el.com/eng/Articles/ITS-Alarms-Apr2011.pdf], Weiler and Harel: Managing the Risks of Use Errors: The ITS Warning Systems Case Study&lt;/ref&gt;
* A use error is a mishap in which a human operator is involved. Typically, such mishaps are attributed to the failure of the human operator &lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754648260], Dekker, 2007: The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A force majeure is a mishap that does not involve a human being in the chain of events preceding the event.

==Use errors in health care==
In 1998, Cook, Woods and Miller presented the concept of [[hindsight bias]], exemplified by celebrated accidents in medicine, by a workgroup on patient safety
.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ctlab.org/documents/A%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Stories.pdf], Cook RI, Woods DD, Miller C [1998] A Tale of Two Stories: Contrasting Views of Patient Safety
&lt;/ref&gt;
The workgroup pointed at the tendency to attribute accidents in health care to isolated human failures.
They provide references to early research about the effect of knowledge of the outcome, which was unavailable beforehand, on later judgement about the processes that led up to that outcome. They explain that in looking back, we tend to oversimplify the situation that the actual practitioners faces. They conclude focusing on the hindsight knowledge prevents our understanding of the richer story, the circumstances of the human error.

According to this position, the term Use Error is formally defined in several [[international standard]]s, such as [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 62366, [[ISO 14155]] and [[ISO 14971]], to describe
: ''an act or omission of an act that results in a different medical device response than intended by the manufacturer or expected by the user.''

[[ISO standards]] about medical devices and procedures provide examples of use errors, which are attributed to human factors, include slips, [[lapses]] and mistakes. Practically, this means that they are attributed to the user, implying the user’s accountability.
The  U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] glossary of medical devices provides the following explanation about this term:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/InfusionPumps/ucm202502.htm], FDA, Medical Devices, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Safe and effective use of a medical device means that users do not make errors that lead to injury and they achieve the desired medical treatment. If safe and effective use is not achieved, use error has occurred. Why and how use error occurs is a [[human factors]] concern."

With this interpretation by ISO and the FDA, the term ‘use error’ is actually synonymous with ‘user error’.
Another approach, which distinguishes ‘use errors’ from ‘user errors', is taken by IEC 62366. Annex A includes an explanation justifying the new term:
:"This International Standard uses the concept of use error. This term was chosen over the more commonly used term of “human error” because not all errors associated with the use of medical device are the result of oversight or carelessness of the part of the user of the medical device. Much more commonly, use errors are the direct result of poor user interface design."

This explanation complies with “The New View”, which Sidney Dekker suggested as an alternative to “The Old View”. This interpretation favors investigations intended to understand the situation, rather than blaming the operators.

In a 2011 report draft on health IT usability, the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) defines "use error" in healthcare IT this way: “Use error is a term used very specifically to refer to user interface designs that will engender users to make errors of commission or omission. It is true that users do make errors, but many errors are due not to user error per se but due to designs that are flawed, e.g., poorly written messaging, misuse of color-coding conventions, omission of information, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;''NISTIR 7804: Technical Evaluation, Testing and Validation of the Usability of Electronic Health Records, Draft, Sept. 2011, pg. 10. '' [https://www.nist.gov/healthcare/usability/upload/Draft_EUP_09_28_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example of user error ===
An example of an accident due to a user error is the ecological disaster of 1967 caused by the [[Torrey Canyon]] supertanker. The accident was due to a combination of several exceptional events, the result of which was that the supertanker was heading directly to the rocks. At that point, the captain failed to change the course because the steering control lever was inadvertently set to the Control position, which disconnected the rudder from the wheel at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Casey, A memento of your service, in Set Phasers on Stun, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of user failure to handle system failure===
Examples of the second type are the [[Three Mile Island accident]] described above, the [[New York City blackout of 1977|NYC blackout]] following a storm and the chemical plant disaster in Bhopal, India ([[Bhopal Disaster]]).

==Classifying use errors==
The URM Model &lt;ref name="Task-oriented"&gt;
[http://avi.har-el.com/eng/Articles/Task-Oriented-SE.pdf], Zonnenshain &amp; Harel: Task-oriented SE, INCOSE 2009 Conference, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes use errors in terms of the user’s failure to manage a system deficiency. Six categories of use errors are described in a URM document:
#Expected faults with risky results;
#Expected faults with unexpected results;
#Expected user errors in identifying risky situations (this study);
#User Errors in handling expected faults;
#Expected errors in function selection;
#Unexpected faults, due to operating in exceptional states.

==Critics==
Erik Hollnagel argues that going from and 'old' view to a 'new' view is not enough. One should go all the way to a 'no' view. This means that the notion of error, whether user error or use error might be destructive rather than constructive. 
Instead, he proposes to focus on the performance variability of everyday actions, on the basis that this performance variability is both useful and necessary. In most cases the result is that things go right, in a few cases that things go wrong. But the reason is the same.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Hollnagel expanded on this in his writings about the [[efficiency–thoroughness trade-off principle]]

'''''You Me Bum Bum Train''''' is an [[Interactive theatre]] performance devised by Kate Bond and Morgan Lloyd in 2004. The pair met as art students in Brighton, where they were studying illustration and film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/you-me-bum-bum-train-all-aboard-for-the-ride-of-a-lifetime-a2473106.html ''Evening Standard'' interview, 11 August 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''You Me Bum Bum Train'' gained critical acclaim in the United Kingdom when it was awarded the [[Samuel Beckett Award|Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |title=Barbican announces Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust award-winner|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730232240/http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while showing in a disused office in London. In 2010 it won the [[Evening Standard Theatre Award]] for outstanding newcomer. 

It returned in 2012 in a former postal depot in [[Holborn]], and a new version of the show – at Empire House in Stratford, east London in 2012 – was nominated for an [[Olivier Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |title=Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre - Olivier Awards|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402194001/http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the show was mounted again, this time in at what had been [[Foyles]] bookshop on London's [[Charing Cross Road]] where their last show, started on 25 February 2016, finished on 29 April.

==Overview==
Visitors to the performance pass through a series of scenes of which they have no foreknowledge, in which they are either passive or where they must improvise a part without any preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Dickson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/11/best-theatre-2012-you-me-bum |title=Best theatre of 2012, No 9: You Me Bum Bum Train &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna Hanra, writing for ''Vice'', described it as a series of "highly detailed, absurd real life scenarios following one another on a nonsense high-paced narrative".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/you-me-bum-bum-train-378 ''Vice'' interview, 19 June 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The entertainment magazine ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' reported; "What was one of London's more obtuse treasures is set to become one of Great Britain's proudest moments." ''[[The Times]]'' said; "It leaves you questioning everything, and it's lots of fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/style/article1480556.ece|title=Album review|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] magazine wrote; "My highlight of 2008 was You Me Bum Bum Train, if only real life were that interesting."

==Controversies==
''You Me Bum Bum Train'' has provoked controversy due to the fact that none of the performers gets paid, though the directors stress that performers and crew are involved on a voluntary basis, that many are not trained professionals and that they are under no obligation to stay during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnett|first=Laura|title=You Me Bum Bum Train gives actors a bad ride, says union|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/13/you-me-bum-bum-train-equity|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=Theguardian.co.uk|date=13 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/07/equity-warns-sell-out-show-of-possible-minimum-wage-breach/|title=Equity warns sell-out show of possible minimum wage breach - News - The Stage|author=Natalie Woolman|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was criticized for its ticketing system which caused problems for ticket buyers in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/ticketing-bum-bum-train-fire/|title=Ticketing for You Me Bum Bum Train under fire - Carousel, News - The Stage|author=Matthew Hemley|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 the trade union Equity criticised their £150,000 Arts Council England funding as YMBBT were advertising for professional dancers but were not paying them, despite selling tickets "at rates typical of a West End show." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.equity.org.uk/news-and-events/equity-news/equity-questions-arts-council-funding-decision/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/bum-bum-train-comes-fire-actors-union/agencies/article/1374456&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the trade union BECTU criticised YMBBT for "exploiting workers after advertising for unpaid production interns." BECTU launched an investigation concerning "the legality of the “outrageous” internships, which would see successful applicants work at least two days each week for a minimum four hours each day." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2016/bectu-launches-probe-exploitative-bum-bum-train-internships/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2016/alistair-smith-show-producers-pay-stance-hits-a-bum-note/&lt;/ref&gt;
