'''Acronym Finder''' ('''AF''') is a free online searchable dictionary and database of [[abbreviation]]s ([[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s, and others) and their meanings.

The entries are classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes. For abbreviations with multiple meanings they are listed by popularity with the most common one being listed first. {{As of | 2018}} it claims to have over a million "''human-edited''" and verified [[definition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|website=www.acronymfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997 but he began compiling it in 1985 working as a computer systems officer for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116865656948675976|title=BTW, if you need Info About C4ISR, Read This ASAP|author=Barry Newman|date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] His first acronym list running up-to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/2012630.html|title=Website of the Week — Acronym Finder (MP3)|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molloy and his wife served as the editors of the website verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as "''MSG''" which [[Madison Square Garden]] wanted as a domain name (''msg.com'') claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as [[monosodium glutamate]] and message among others. The Garden in the end settled out of court and came to own [https://www.msg.com/ msg.com].

The website was maintained under Mountain Data Systems, LLC by Molloy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556|title=Acronym finder [digital] : AF. in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|last=|first=|date=|website=acronymfinder.com|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628092508/http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sold off and eventually coming under the ownership of '''''Farlex, Inc.''''' publishers of [[TheFreeDictionary.com|Thefreedictionary.com]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farlex.acronym.finder|title=Acronym Finder - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The website contains a database of meanings and expansions for [[abbreviation]]s, [[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s mainly in English but includes some entries in other languages such as French, German, Spanish etc. as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbis.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/detail.php?bib_id=ubos&amp;colors=&amp;ocolors=&amp;lett=fs&amp;tid=0&amp;titel_id=2223|title=Acronym Finder|date=|website=dbis.uni-regensburg.de|publisher=[[Universität Regensburg]]|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is freely accessible. The entries are further classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes which are shown on a Map along with location information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/blog/2017/04/03/e-tipp-der-woche-acronym-finder/|title=e-Tipp der Woche: Acronym Finder {{!}} [UB]log|website=blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations with multiple expansions are listed by popularity with the most common one being presented first, these can be sorted alphabetically as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/57676-acronym-finder|title=Acronym Finder - ExtremeTech|date=2001-09-05|work=ExtremeTech|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;GIRALDO ORTIZ, John Jairo.

Jul.-Dec. 2008, vol. 31, no. 2, p. 101-117&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone can contribute to the database by submitting abbreviations and their meanings, these are reviewed by an by [[editing|editor]] and categorized before being added to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; While the database has been described as fairly accurate errors have been found in the meanings and expansions of abbreviations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The website does not list sources for the abbreviations and their meanings but it does identify people who have contributed more than 50 abbreviations to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The database only contains abbreviations and their expansions and does not list other data such as grammatical category, context, source, field of the abbreviation etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Farlex, Inc. the current owner of the website also publishes mobile apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acronym-finder-acronyms-abbreviations-initialisms-more/id1032748692?mt=8|title=Acronym Finder - Acronyms, Abbreviations, Initialisms, and more on the App Store|website=App Store|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acronym Finder also includes a ''Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector'', a light-hearted tool that [[random]]ly generates jargon-like phrases and abbreviations — usually [[initialisms]] that would be unpronounceable as [[acronyms]] — and meanings from 30 cleverly chosen buzz words.

The website is supported through advertisements.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

==Reputation==
The website is listed as a quick reference tool in directories like Stanford Library, Library of Congress, USC Library.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556 &lt;nowiki&gt;Acronym finder [digital] : AF&lt;/nowiki&gt;]".

Listings of abbreviations on the website have also been used as a defense that an abbreviation is in public use and cannot be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States Patents Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrdCAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Bureau of National Affairs|page=1283}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in some trademark cases citations for AF have been accepted it has been described as an unreliable reference in others.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|title=CTM upheld after medical trade mark declared not to be descriptive|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2011|website=oami.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123134443/http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|archive-date=November 23, 2011|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has garnered criticism for the fact that anyone can submit abbreviations to the site and the content is user generated. Mike Molloy the site's original owner had defended that each submission is verified before being added to the database.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9644">An '''autogram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: αὐτός = self,  γράμμα = letter) is a sentence that describes itself in the sense of providing an inventory of its own characters. They were invented by [[Lee Sallows]], who also coined the word ''autogram''.&lt;ref name=quest/&gt; An essential feature is the use of full cardinal number names such as “one”, “two”, etc., in recording character counts. Autograms are also called ‘self-enumerating’ or ‘self-documenting’ sentences. Often, letter counts only are recorded while punctuation signs are ignored, as in this example:

:This sentence employs two a’s, two c’s, two d’s, twenty-eight e’s, five f’s, three g’s, eight h’s, eleven i’s, three l’s, two m’s, thirteen n’s, nine o’s, two p’s, five r’s, twenty-five s’s, twenty-three t’s, six v’s, ten w’s, two x’s, five y’s, and one z.

The first autogram to be published was composed by Sallows in 1982 and appeared in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s "[[Metamagical Themas]]" column in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, D.R. “Metamagical Themas” Scientific American, January 1982, pp 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

:Only the fool would take trouble to verify that his sentence was composed of ten a’s, three b’s, four c’s, four d’s, forty-six e’s, sixteen f’s, four g’s, thirteen h’s, fifteen i’s, two k’s, nine l’s, four m’s, twenty-five n’s, twenty-four o’s, five p’s, sixteen r’s, forty-one s’s, thirty-seven t’s, ten u’s, eight v’s, eight w’s, four x’s, eleven y’s, twenty-seven commas, twenty-three apostrophes, seven hyphens and, last but not least, a single !

The task of producing an autogram is perplexing because the object to be described cannot be known until its description is first complete.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, D.R., ''Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;390–92, Basic Books, {{ISBN|978-0-465-04566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letaw J.R. Pangrams: A Nondeterministic Approach, ''Abacus'', Vol 2, No 3, Spring 1985, pp 42–47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-enumerating pangrams==
A type of autogram that has attracted special interest is the autogramic [[pangram]], a self-enumerating sentence in which every letter of the alphabet occurs at least once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/self-enumerating_sentence.html Encyclopedia of Science:  self-enumerating sentence]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain letters do not appear in either of the two autograms above, which are therefore not pangrams. The first ever self-enumerating pangram appeared in a Dutch newspaper and was composed by [[Rudy Kousbroek]].&lt;ref&gt;Kousbroek, R., “Welke Vraag Heeft Vierendertig Letters?” NRC Handelsblad, Cultureel  Supplement 640, 11 Feb. 1983, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kousbroek, R. “Instructies Voor Het Demonteren Van Een Bom,” NRC Handelsblad, Cultereel Supplement 644, 11 March 1983, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kousbroek, R. “De Logologische Ruimte” Amsterdam: Meulenhoff, 1984, pp 135–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Sallows, who lives in the Netherlands, was challenged by Kousbroek to produce a self-enumerating ‘translation’ of this pangram into English—an impossible-seeming task. This prompted Sallows to construct an electronic Pangram Machine.&lt;ref name=quest&gt;[http://www.leesallows.com/files/In%20Quest%20of%20a%20Pangram1.pdf Sallows, L., In Quest of a Pangram, Abacus, Vol 2, No 3, Spring 1985, pp 22–40]&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually the machine succeeded, producing the example below which was published in Scientific American in October 1984:&lt;ref&gt;Dewdney, A.K. “Computer Recreations” Scientific American, October 1984, pp 18–22&lt;/ref&gt;

:This pangram contains four as, one b, two cs, one d, thirty es, six fs, five gs, seven hs, eleven is, one j, one k, two ls, two ms, eighteen ns, fifteen os, two ps, one q, five rs, twenty-seven ss, eighteen ts, two us, seven vs, eight ws, two xs, three ys, &amp; one z.

Sallows wondered if one could produce a pangram that counts its letters as percentages of the whole sentence–a particularly difficult task since such percentages usually won't be exact integers.  He mentioned the problem to Chris Patuzzo and in late 2015 Patuzzo produced the following solution:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futilitycloset.com/2015/11/16/a-new-pangram/ A New Pangram] [[Futility Closet]], November 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whyarecomputers.com/audio/why-are-computers-episode-4.mp3 Chris Patuzzo on self-enumerating pangrams] Podcase interview by Tom Stewart&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
Autograms exist that exhibit extra self-descriptive features. Besides counting each letter, here the total number of letters appearing is also named:&lt;ref name=wasser&gt;[http://www.fatrazie.com/EWpangram.html Self-enumerating pangrams:  A logological history by Eric Wassenaar, April 17, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524205809/http://www.fatrazie.com/EWpangram.html |date=May 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reflex/&gt;

:This sentence contains one hundred and ninety-seven letters: four a's, one b, three c's, five d's, thirty-four e's, seven f's, one g, six h's, twelve i's, three l's, twenty-six n's, ten o's, ten r's, twenty-nine s's, nineteen t's, six u's, seven v's, four w's, four x's, five y's, and one z.

Just as an autogram is a sentence that describes itself, so there exist closed chains of sentences each of which describes its predecessor in the chain. Viewed thus, an autogram is such a chain of length 1. Here follows a chain of length 2:&lt;ref name=wasser/&gt;&lt;ref name=reflex/&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;
{|
|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:left;width:24em;height:8em;table-layout:fixed;"
|-
|The right-hand sentence contains four a's, one b, three c's, three d's, thirty-nine e's, ten f's, one g, eight h's, eight i's, one j, one k, four l's, one m, twenty-three n's, fifteen o's, one p, one q, nine r's, twenty-three s's, twenty-one t's, four u's, seven v's, six w's, two x's, five y's, and one z.

|}
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

==Reflexicons==
A special kind of autogram is the ‘reflexicon’ (short for “reflexive lexicon”), which is a self-descriptive word list that describes its own letter frequencies.  The constraints on reflexicons are much tighter than on autograms because the freedom to choose alternative words such as “contains”, “comprises”, “employs”, and so on, is lost. However, a degree of freedom still exists through appending entries to the list that are strictly superfluous.

For example, “Sixteen e's, six f's, one g, three h's, nine i's, nine n's, five o's, five r's, sixteen s's, five t's, three u's, four v's, one w, four x's” is a reflexicon, but it includes what Sallows calls “dummy text” in the shape of “one g” and “one w”. The latter might equally be replaced with “one #”, where “#” can be any typographical sign not already listed. Sallows has made an extensive computer search and conjectures that there exist but three and only three pure (i.e., no dummy text) English reflexicons.&lt;ref name=reflex&gt;[http://www.leesallows.com/files/Reflexicons%20VERSION%203.pdf Sallows, L., Reflexicons, Word Ways, August 1992, 25; 3: 131–41]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}

An '''autological word''' (also called '''homological word'''{{cn|date=April 2017}} or '''autonym'''{{cn|date=April 2017}}) is a word that expresses a property that it also possesses (e.g. the word "short" is short, "noun" is a noun, "English" is English, "[[wiktionary:pentasyllabic|pentasyllabic]]" has five syllables, "word" is a word). The opposite is a '''heterological''' word, one that does not apply to itself (e.g. "long" is not long, "monosyllabic" has five syllables).

Unlike more general concepts of autology and self-reference, this particular distinction and opposition of "autological" and "heterological words" is uncommon in [[linguistics]] for describing linguistic phenomena or classes of words, but is current in logic and philosophy where it was introduced by [[Kurt Grelling]] and [[Leonard Nelson]] for describing a semantic paradox, later known as Grelling's paradox or the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Grelling and Nelson used the following definition when first publishing their paradox in 1908: "Let ''&lt;big&gt;φ&lt;/big&gt;(M)'' be the word that denotes the concept defining ''M''. This word is either an element of ''M'' or not. In the first case we will call it 'autological', in the second 'heterological'." (Peckhaus 1995, p. 269). An earlier version of Grelling's paradox had been presented by Nelson in a letter to [[Gerhard Hessenberg]] on 28 May 1907, where "heterological" is not yet used and "autological words" are defined as "words that fall under the concepts denoted by them" (Peckhaus 1995, p. 277)&lt;/ref&gt; 

One source of autological words is [[ostensive definition]]: the reference to a class of words by an example of the member of the class, as it were by [[synecdoche]]: such as [[mondegreen]], [[oxymoron]], [[eggcorn]], [[bahuvrihi]], etc.
A word's status as autological may change over time. For example, ''[[neologism]]'' was once an autological word but no longer is; similarly, ''[[wikt:protologism|protologism]]'' (a word invented recently by literary theorist [[Mikhail Epstein]]) may or may not lose its autological status depending on whether or not it gains wider usage.

A '''circular reference''' is a series of [[reference]]s where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.
[[File:Circular Reference.svg|thumb|Circular reference (in red)]]

==In language==
A circular reference is not to be confused with the logical fallacy of a [[circular argument]].  Although a circular reference will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a circular reference is of no use.  Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a circular reference since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful reference.  Sentences containing circular references can still be meaningful;

:''Her brother gave her a kitten; his sister thanked him for it.''

is circular but not without meaning.  Indeed, it can be argued that self-reference is a necessary consequence of Aristotle's [[Law of non-contradiction]], a fundamental philosophical [[axiom]].  In this view, without self-reference, [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] become impossible, or at least, lack usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry A. Osborn]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fvJTwwCSy8UC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''The future of foreign language education in the United States''], pp.31-33, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|0-89789-719-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fiengo&gt;Robert Fiengo, Robert May, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V77kaAVpU0UC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''Indices and identity''], pp.59-62, MIT Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-262-56076-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer programming==
{{For|circular references between objects or resources|Reference counting}}

Circular references can appear in [[computer programming]] when one piece of code requires the result from another, but that code needs the result from the first. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Function A will show the time the sun last set based on the current date, which it can obtain by calling Function B. Function B will calculate the date based on the number of times the moon has orbited the earth since the last time Function B was called.  So, Function B asks Function C just how many times that is.  Function C doesn't know, but can figure it out by calling Function A to get the time the sun last set.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The entire set of functions is now worthless because none of them can return any useful information whatsoever.  This leads to what is technically known as a [[livelock]].  It also appears in [[spreadsheet]]s when two cells require each other's result.  For example, if the value in Cell A1 is to be obtained by adding 5 to the value in Cell B1, and the value in Cell B1 is to be obtained by adding 3 to the value in Cell A1, no values can be computed.  (Even if the specifications are A1:=B1+5 and B1:=A1-5, there is still a circular reference.  It doesn't help that, for instance, A1=3 and B1=-2 would satisfy both formulae, as there are infinitely many other possible values of A1 and B1 that can satisfy both instances.)

A circular reference represents a big problem in computing.

In ISO Standard SQL circular integrity constraints are implicitly supported within a single table. Between multiple tables circular constraints (e.g. foreign keys) are permitted by defining the constraints as deferrable (See [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html CREATE TABLE] for PostgreSQL and [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/clauses002.htm#i1015767 DEFERRABLE Constraint Examples] for Oracle). In that case the constraint is checked at the end of the transaction not at the time the DML statement is executed. To update a circular reference two statements can be issued in a single transaction that will satisfy both references once the transaction is committed.

A distinction should be made with processes containing a circular reference between those that are incomputable and those that are an iterative calculation with a final output.  The latter may fail in spreadsheets not equipped to handle them but are nevertheless still logically valid.&lt;ref name=Fiengo/&gt;

==In spreadsheets==
Circular reference in worksheets can be a very useful technique for solving implicit equations such as the [[Colebrook equation]] and many others, which might otherwise require tedious Newton-Raphson algorithms in VBA or use of macros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Solve Implicit Equations Inside Your Worksheet By Anilkumar M, Dr Sreenivasan E and Dr Raghunathan K |url=http://www.frpdesigns.com/iteration.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">The '''Citation Style Language''' ('''CSL''') is an open [[XML]]-based language to describe the formatting of [[citation]]s and [[bibliographic|bibliographies]]. [[Reference management software|Reference management programs]] using CSL include [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]] and [[Papers (software)|Papers]].

==History==

CSL was created by Bruce D'Arcus for use with [[OpenOffice.org]],&lt;ref&gt;CiteProc at OpenOffice Bibliographic Project. http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/citeproc/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OpenOffice Bibliographic Project. http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[XSLT]]-based "[[CiteProc]]" CSL processor. CSL was further developed in collaboration with [[Zotero]] developer Simon Kornblith. Since 2008, the core development team consists of D'Arcus, Frank Bennett and Rintze Zelle.

The releases of CSL are 0.8 (March 21, 2009), 0.8.1 (February 1, 2010), 1.0 (March 22, 2010), and 1.0.1 (September 3, 2012). CSL 1.0 was a backward-incompatible release, but styles in the 0.8.1 format can be automatically updated to the CSL 1.0 format.&lt;ref&gt;Update instructions to convert CSL 0.8.1 styles to the 1.0 format. http://citationstyles.org/downloads/upgrade-notes.html#updating-csl-0-8-styles&lt;/ref&gt;

On its release in 2006, [[Zotero]] became the first application to adopt CSL. In 2008 [[Mendeley]] was released with CSL support, and in 2011, [[Papers (software)|Papers]] and [[Qiqqa]] gained support for CSL-based citation formatting.

==Software support==

* [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]], [[Papers (software)|Papers]], and [[Qiqqa]] all support CSL 1.0 ([[Zotero]] also supports CSL 0.8.1 styles, which are internally updated to CSL 1.0).
* [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]], and [[Qiqqa]] rely on the ''citeproc-js'' JavaScript CSL processor.
* CSL 1.0 processors have also been written in Haskell (''citeproc-hs''), PHP, Python, and Ruby.&lt;ref name="jv"&gt;Jakob Voß (May 2010), "Quick introduction to the Citation Style Language (CSL)", Lightning Talk proposal European Library Automation Group Conference. http://www.slideshare.net/nichtich/voss-elag-csl2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]], and [[Qiqqa]] provide a built-in CSL editor to help create and modify CSL styles.

==Styles==

The CSL project maintains a CSL 1.0 style repository, which contains over 9000 styles (more than 1700 unique styles).&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citation Network''' is a [[social network]] which contains paper sources and linked by co-citation relationships. Egghe &amp; Rousseau once (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;228) explain "when a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' cites a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can show this by an arrow going from the node representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the document representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this way the documents from a collection D form a directed graph, which is called a 'citation graph' or 'citation network' ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/citation_network.htm Science Citation Index: Effectiveness in locating articles in the anaesthetics field: 'Perturbation of ion transport'. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 43: 814, Cawkell, A. E. (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==
[[Citation]] is a reference to a published or unpublished source (not always the original source). More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.
Citation networks, the principal focus of this study, are one kind of social networks that have been studied quantitatively almost from the moment citation databases first became available. In 1965, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI in his seminal paper titled "Networks of Scientific Papers". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. In 1973, Henry Small published his work on co-citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually what is called "Research Reviews".&lt;ref name="background"&gt;[http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/publications/papers/CMU-ECE-2011-017.pdf Structures and Statistics of Citation Networks, Miray Kas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis and figures&lt;ref name="background" /&gt; ==
* Citation networks are directed. The links go from one document to the other. 
* Citation networks are acyclic because a paper can cite only existing papers.
* All edges in the citation networks point backwards in time.
* Links in co-authorship networks are reciprocal (symmetric).
* The link weights between two authors in co-authorship networks can increase over time if they have further collaboration.
* Vertices and edges added to the citation/co-authorship networks are permanent and cannot be removed at a later time. 
* The already formed part of the network is mostly static and only the leading edge of the network changes.

The technique was first used after [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Kennedy assassination|assassination]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;  From the early 1980s through 2004 the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] conducted about 2,500 analyses on cases submitted by law-enforcement groups.  The results of these analyses had often been questioned by defence lawyers and the press, so the FBI finally asked the [[United States National Academy of Science]]'s [[Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy]] to research the scientific merit of the process.

In 2004 the Board's study was summarized in "Forensic Analysis: Weighing Bullet Lead Evidence."  The Board determined that the chemical analyses were being performed correctly and were probably sufficient to determine correlation between two bullets from separate sources (the analysis used [[Atomic emission spectroscopy|plasma-optical emission spectroscopy]] to identify trace elements in the bullets).  The report also concluded that the seven trace elements selected for the analyses (arsenic, antimony, tin, copper, bismuth, silver and cadmium) are acceptable for sample correlation.  The report finally concluded that the procedure is the best available method for such correlations.  The greatest [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]] in the report was that the [[Statistics|statistical]] tests as applied by the FBI could cause confusion and misinterpretation when transmitted to prosecutors or when explained to a trial jury.  Because of the significance of this weakness, the report concluded that the analysis should be used with caution.  This report helped the FBI decide in 2004 to voluntarily cease offering the analysis to law-enforcement entities. The National Academy of Sciences never required that the FBI stop using the test.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;

''CNN PRESENTS Encore Presentation: Reasonable Doubt'' examined the unreliability of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=CNN PRESENTS-Encore Presentation: ''Reasonable Doubt''| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/07/cp.01.html | publisher=CNN | date=Aired May 7, 2006| accessdate=May 31, 2013| format=transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been discontinued as of September 1, 2005.&lt;ref name="FBI Press Release"&gt;{{cite press release| title=FBI Laboratory Announces Discontinuation of Bullet Lead Examinations| url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-laboratory-announces-discontinuation-of-bullet-lead-examinations| publisher=FBI National Press Office| date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. government]] has fought releasing the list of the estimated 2,500 cases over three decades in which it performed the analysis, which may have led to [[false conviction]]s. According to the FBI, only 20% of the 2,500 tests performed introduced the CBLA results into evidence at trial.&lt;ref name="FBI Press Release" /&gt;

On 17 December 2008, Jimmy Ates was released from a Florida prison after serving ten years on the conviction of having murdered his wife, a conviction obtained largely on the strength of a bullet-lead analysis.  His conviction was overturned as a consequence of the 2004 report.&lt;ref name=Bohaty&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bohaty| first=Rochelle F.

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]], and is sometimes seen as more general than, or similar to, [[comparative psychology]].
From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

In order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|pmid=26302412|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14426">'''Comparative physiology''' is a [[List of academic disciplines|subdiscipline]] of [[physiology]] that studies and exploits the diversity of functional characteristics of various kinds of [[organisms]].  It is closely related to [[evolutionary physiology]] and [[environmental physiology]].  Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to [[Clifford Ladd Prosser]], "Comparative Physiology
is not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy."&lt;ref name="Prosser1975"/&gt;

==History==
Originally, [[physiology]] focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve [[medical]] practices.  When physiologists first began comparing different [[species]] it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles.  This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the [[Krogh Principle]].

==Methodology==
C. Ladd Prosser,&lt;ref name='Greenbergetal1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=M. J. |author2=P. W. Hochachka |author3=C. P. Mangum |year=1975|title=Biographical data:  Clifford Ladd Prosser| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940102|pmid=1104756}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] and Carter&lt;ref name="GarlandCarter1994"/&gt;):

1.  To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.
:This amounts to cataloging functional aspects of biological diversity, and has recently been criticized as "stamp collecting" with the suggestion that the field should move beyond that initial, exploratory phase.&lt;ref name='MangumHochachka1998'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangum|first=C. P.|author2=P. W. Hochachka|year=1998|title=New directions in comparative physiology and biochemistry: mechanisms, adaptations, and evolution| url=|journal=Physiological Zoology|issn=|volume=71|issue=5|pages=471–484|doi=|pmid=9754524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.  The use of physiological information to reconstruct	[[phylogenetic]] relationships of organisms.&lt;br /&gt;
:In principle physiological information could be used just as morphological information or [[DNA]] sequence is used to measure evolutionary divergence of organisms.  In practice, this has rarely been done, for at least four reasons:
:* physiology doesn't leave many [[fossil]] cues,
:* it can't be measured on [[museum]] specimens,
:* it is difficult to quantify as compared with morphology or DNA sequences, and
:* physiology is more likely to be adaptive than DNA, and so subject to parallel and [[convergent evolution]], which confuses phylogenetic reconstruction.

3.  To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.
:This is essentially [[physiological ecology]] or ecological physiology.

4.  To identify "model systems" for studying particular physiological functions.
:Examples of this include using squid giant axons to understand general principles of nerve transmission, using rattlesnake tail shaker muscles for measurement of in vivo changes in metabolites (because the whole animal can be put in an NMR machine),&lt;ref name='Conley_Lindstedt_1996'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=K. E.|author2=S. L. Lindstedt|year=1996|title=Rattlesnake tail-shaking: minimal cost per twitch in striated muscle| url=|journal=Nature|issn=|volume=383|pmid=8779716|issue=6595|pages=71–73|doi=10.1038/383071a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of ectothermic poikilotherms to study effects of temperature on physiology.

5.  To use the "kind of animal" as an experimental variable.
: "While other branches of physiology use such variables as light, temperature, oxygen tension, and hormone balance, comparative physiology uses, in addition, species or animal type as a variable for each function." &lt;ref name='prosser1950'&gt;Prosser (1950, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
: 25 years later, Prosser put things this way: "I like to think of it as that method in physiology which uses kind of organism as one experimental variable."&lt;ref name='Prosser1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prosser|first=C. L.|year=1975|title=Prospects for comparative physiology and biochemistry| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|pmid=1194870|issue=1|pages=345–348|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative physiologists often study organisms that live in "extreme" [[Natural environment|environments]] (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation.&lt;ref name='GarlandCarter1994'&gt;{{cite journal|last= [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] |first=T., Jr.|author2=P. A. Carter|year=1994|title=Evolutionary physiology| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlCa94.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|issn=|volume=56|issue=|pages=579–621|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.003051|pmid= 8010752}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.&lt;ref name='Al-kahtani_et_al_2004'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-kahtani|first=M.A. |author2=C. Zuleta |author3=E. Caviedes-Vidal |author4=[[Theodore Garland, Jr|T. Garland, Jr.]] |year=2004|title=Kidney mass and relative medullary thickness of rodents in relation to habitat, body size, and phylogeny| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Al-kahtaniEA2004.pdf|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology |issn=|volume=77|issue=3|pages=346–365|doi=10.1086/420941|pmid=15286910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to "unusual" organisms, such as very large or small ones.  As an example, of the latter, [[hummingbirds]] have been studied.  As another example, [[giraffe]] have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of [[blood pressure]].  More generally, [[ectothermic]] [[vertebrates]] have been studied to determine how [[blood]] [[acid-base balance]] and [[pH]] change as [[body temperature]] changes.

==Funding==
In the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].

[[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] (1915–2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative physiology, serving on the faculty at [[Duke University]] for many years and training a large number of students [https://web.archive.org/web/20070210060243/http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2007/01/schmidt-nielsen.html (obituary)].  He also authored several books, including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style.

[[Grover C. Stephens]]  (1925–2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative physiologist, serving on the faculty of the [[University of Minnesota]] until becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the [[University of California at Irvine]] in 1964.  He was the mentor for numerous graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field [http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/GroverC.Stephens.htm (obituary)].  He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.

'''Comparative psychology''' refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species from insects to primates.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papini, M.R. (2003). Comparative Psychology. In ''Handbook of Research Methods in Experimental Psychology''. Ed. Stephen F. Davis. Blackwell. Malden, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single [[organism]] to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both [[proximate and ultimate causation]].  &lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"&gt;Dewsbury, D. (1984). ''Comparative Psychology in the Twentieth Century''. Hutchinson Ross Publishing Company. Stroudsburg, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | year = 1963 | title = On aims and methods of ethology | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 410–33 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.

Third, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see [[Tinbergen's four questions]].

==History==
The 9th century scholar [[al-Jahiz]] wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants.&lt;ref name=Amber-376&gt;{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th century Arabic writer [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) wrote the ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', an early treatise dealing with the effects of [[zoomusicology|music on an imals]]. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or retarded with the use of [[Arabic music|music]], and shows other examples of how music can affect [[ethology|animal behavior]], experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the [[Western world]] continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Plott|2000|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of "pre-" and "post-Darwin" because his contributions were so influential.   theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the "anecdotal movement" led by [[George Romanes]] who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a "rudimentary human mind".&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt; Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"&gt;Dewsbury, D. (1978). ''Comparative Animal Behavior''. McGraw-Hill Book Company. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. [[Douglas Alexander Spalding]] was called the "first experimental biologist",&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt; and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. [[Jacques Loeb]] emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, [[Sir John Lubbock]] is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]] is thought to be "the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word".&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt;

Throughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term "comparative psychology" is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.

A persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;  However, the definition of "intelligence" in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism, and focuses on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation are plagued with practical and theoretical problems.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt; In the literature, "intelligence" is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]).&lt;ref name="Wynne, C. D. L., 1978"&gt;Wynne, C. D. L. (1978). ''Animal Cognition: The Mental Lives of Animals''. Palgrave. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;

==Species studied==
[[Image:Cat brain.jpg|right|thumb|the brain of a cat]]
A wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike]] began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical [[rat]], which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.

Skinner introduced the use of [[pigeon]]s, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of [[primate]]; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by [[Harry F. Harlow]]'s studies of [[maternal deprivation]] in [[rhesus monkey]]s. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg, W.N. and L.A. Kellogg. (1933) ''The Ape and The Child: A Comparative Study of the Environmental Influence Upon Early Behavior''. Hafner Publishing Co., New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named [[Gua (chimpanzee)|Gua]] was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs' infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended 9 months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.

Nonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] 350 words in [[American Sign Language]]. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, [[Loulis (chimpanzee)|Loulis]]. A criticism of Washoe's acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated.&lt;ref&gt;Terrace (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage-Rumbaugh (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Klaus Zuberbühler |title=Linguistic capacity of non-human animals |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science |volume=6 |date=2015 |pages=313-321 |doi=10.1002/wcs.1338

Interest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be [[intelligence (trait)|intelligent]] have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of [[corvid]], parrots — especially the [[grey parrot]] — and [[dolphin]]s. Alex (Avian Learning EXperiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg,&lt;ref&gt;Pepperberg, I. M. 1991 A communicative approach to animal cognition: a study of conceptual abilities of a grey parrot. In: ''Cognitive Ethology: the Minds of Other Animals'' (Ed. Carolyn A. Ristau), Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale New Jersey; Hove and London England.&lt;/ref&gt; who found that the African gray parrot [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]] did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a  level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John W. Pilley |author2=Alliston K. Reid |title=Border collie comprehends object names as verbal referents |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=86 |date=2011 |pages=184–195 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2010.11.007 
 |url=http://webs.wofford.edu/reidak/Pubs/Pilley%20and%20Reid%202011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a [[Border Collie]] named [[Chaser (dog)|Chaser]] was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.

==Animal cognition==
{{main|Animal cognition}}
Researchers who study [[animal cognition]] are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans.  For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and [[animal cognition]] are heavily overlapping research categories.&lt;ref  name="Menzel"&gt;p. 2, Menzel, R. &amp; Fischer, J. (2010) ''Animal Thinking: Contemporary Issues in Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;Wasserman &amp; Zentall (eds) (2006); ''Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, Sara J. (2010); ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior (2nd Ed)'', Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders of animal behavior==
{{Further|Animal psychopathology}}
Veterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Common causes of disordered behavior in captive or [[pet]] animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation. These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases. For example, [[rat]]s who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human [[psychosis]], like biting their owners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the [[dog breed|breed]] as well as on the individual animal's character. For example, [[huskies]] have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian|url=http://www.preloved.co.uk/blog/permalink/17/interview-siberian-husky-club-of-great-britain.html|title=Interview - Siberian Husky Club of Great Britain|publisher=''Preloved''|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dass|first=Dr. Amrita|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081023/jsp/careergraph/story_10004432.jsp|title=Pet Peeves|publisher=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|''The Telegraph'' (Calcutta)]]|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on [[ethological]] studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Human-animal relationships==
{{Main|Anthrozoology}}

The relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society's understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. [[Domestication]] has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, Molly. "Animals and Anthropology." Society and Animals: ''Journal of Human-Animal Studies''. 2002. Web. &lt;http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/sa/sa10.4/mullin.shtml&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ingold &lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Ted, ed. ''What Is an Animal?'' Routledge, 1994. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as "not people," and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: "Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals."  With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who isn't, that is, the outsider.

''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals,&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, Daniel. "Health; Children and Their Pets: Unexpected Psychological Benefits." The ''New York Times''. 1990. Web. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/us/health-children-and-their-pets-unexpected-psychological-benefits.html?src=pm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically of children with their pets. It's been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids' social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, "It made the children more cooperative and sharing." It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.

Furthermore, in an edition of ''Social Science and Medicine'' it was stated, "A random survey of 339 residents from [[Perth, Western Australia]] were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Lisa, Billie Giles-Corti, and Max Bulsara. "The Pet Connection: Pets as a Conduit for Social Capital?" ''Social Science and Medicine'' 61. 2005. 1159–73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.

'''Comparative research''' is a research methodology in the [[social science]]s that aims to make comparisons across different [[country|countries]] or [[culture]]s. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of [[poverty]]).

== Development of the tradition ==

As Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of ''episteme'' and ''philo-sophia'', as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. ''Episteme'', as a form and activity in the field of ''logos'', marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) ‘On comparative inquiry: the Ancient Greek origins’. Research paper presented at the conference of the Comparative Education Society in Europe (CESE), Freiburg, Germany, 11/06/14 - 14/06/14. &lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic ''polis''. Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ ''Histories'' demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. ''isegoria'' and ''parrhesia''), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

According also to [[Karl Deutsch]], we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"&gt;Deutsch 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.

Textbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Clasen"&gt;Clasen 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antal, Dierkes &amp; Weiler 1987: 13&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. [[Globalization]] has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. [[Information technology]] has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.&lt;ref&gt;Øyen 2004: 276&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparative research defined ==
Comparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"&gt;Heidenheimer, Heclo &amp; Adams 1983: 505&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a "seamless whole."&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1985: 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esping"&gt;Esping-Andersen 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clasen"/&gt; The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1990: 14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

In line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate "grand theories," such as [[Marxism]]. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related.&lt;ref&gt;Przeworski &amp; Teune 1970: 31&lt;/ref&gt; The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of [[decommodification]]. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy.&lt;ref name="Esping"/&gt; Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.

Comparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"/&gt; Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.

The [[historical comparative research]] involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

When it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.

{{Sociology}}

'''Comparative sociology''' involves comparison of the social processes between [[nation states]], or across different types of society (for example [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]]). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance.  For example, [[structural Marxists]] have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies.  The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910157494|title=A dictionary of sociology|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scott, John, 1949-|isbn=9780191763052|edition= Fourth|location=Oxford|oclc=910157494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was [[Max Weber]], whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and [[Sociology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. [[Emile Durkheim]] argued in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called [[cross-national research]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Grammatical categories}}
'''Comparison''' is a feature in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] or [[syntax (linguistics)|syntax]] of some [[language]]s, whereby [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The [[comparative]] expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the '''superlative''' is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.

The [[grammatical category]] associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is '''degree of comparison'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoffrey|year=2002|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language|pages=1099–1170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual degrees of comparison are the ''positive'', which simply denotes a property (as with the [[English grammar|English]] words ''big'' and ''fully'');  the ''comparative'', which indicates ''great'''er''''' degree (as ''bigger'' and ''more fully''); and the ''superlative'', which indicates ''great'''est''''' degree (as ''biggest'' and ''most fully'').&lt;ref&gt;Tom McArthur, ed. (1992) ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called [[Elative (gradation)|elative]] in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. ''beautiful'', ''less beautiful'', ''least beautiful''.

The comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the ''-er'' suffix or modifying word ''more'' or ''less'' (e.g., ''fast&lt;u&gt;er&lt;/u&gt;'', ''&lt;u&gt;more&lt;/u&gt; intelligent'', ''&lt;u&gt;less&lt;/u&gt; wasteful''); it can also, however, appear  when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., ''more men than women''). One [[preposition]], ''near'', also has a superlative form, as in ''Find the restaurant nearest your house''.

==Formation of comparatives and superlatives==
Comparatives and superlatives may be formed [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], by inflection, as with the English and [[German grammar|German]] ''-er'' and ''-(e)st'' forms, or [[syntax|syntactically]], as with the English ''more...'' and ''most...'' and the [[French grammar|French]] ''plus...'' and ''le plus...'' forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as ''better'' and ''best'' (from ''good'') and ''less'' and ''least'' (from ''little/few'') in English, and ''meilleur'' (from ''bon'') and ''mieux'' (from the adverb ''bien'') in French.

==Comparative and superlative constructions==
Most if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.

Comparatives are often used with a [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with ''than'' in English, ''als'' in German, etc. In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] and Greek ([[Ancient Greek grammar|Ancient]], [[Koine Greek grammar|Koine]] and [[Modern Greek grammar|Modern]]) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the [[genitive]] case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in "the best swimmer out of all the girls".

Languages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include "as... as" and "less/least...".

А few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], where expressions like "по&amp;#x300; човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)" (literally ''more person'', ''most person'', ''less person'' but normally ''better kind of a person'', ''best kind of person'', ''not that good kind of a person'') and "по&amp;#x300; обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)" (''I like more'', ''I like the least'') are quite usual.&lt;ref&gt;Comparatives in Bulgarian are formed with the particles по and най, separated with the following adjective or adverb with a hyphen. If they are applied to a noun or a verb, they are written as separate words with a grave accent over по ''po''. Comparatives in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] are formed identically but written as one word, Macedonian) (both meaning ''better'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage when considering only two things==

In many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, "May the better man win" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form "May the best man win" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.&lt;ref name=GrammarGirl /&gt;

==Rhetorical use of unbalanced comparatives==

In some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common [[rhetorical]] device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes [[Linguistic prescription|considered ungrammatical]].&lt;ref name=GrammarGirl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/comparatives-versus-superlatives.aspx |title=Comparatives Versus Superlatives |first=Bonnie |last=Trenga |date=12 August 2008 |work=Grammar Girl |publisher=Quick and Dirty Tips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* Always!
* Why pay more?
* We work harder.
* We sell for less!
* More doctors recommend it.

==English==
English has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes ''-er'' (the "comparative") and ''-est'' (the "superlative"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs "more" and "most".

As a general rule, words with one [[syllable]] require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require "more" or "most", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, ''e.g.'' 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/archive/papers/kytorom.html |title=Competing forms of adjective comparison in modern English: What could be more quicker and easier and more effective? |first1=Merja |last1=Kytö |first2=Suzanne |last2=Romaine |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological comparison===

Morphological comparison uses the [[suffix]]es ''-er'' (the "comparative") and ''-est'' (the "superlative"). These inflections are of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin and are [[cognate]] with the [[Latin]] suffixes -''ior'' and -''issimus'' and Ancient Greek -''īōn'' and -''istos''. They are typically added to shorter words, words of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these [[inflection]]s have fewer than three syllables.

This system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like "good", "better", and "best", contain [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms. These irregular forms include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| good || rowspan="2" | better || rowspan="2" | best
|-
| well
|-
| bad, evil || rowspan="2" | worse || rowspan="2" | worst
|-
| ill
|-
| rowspan="2" | far || farther || farthest
|-
| further || furthest
|-
| little || less(er) || least
|-
| many, much || more || most
|}

===Syntactic comparison===
The second system of comparison in English appends the [[grammatical particle]]s "more" and "most", themselves the irregular comparatives of "many" and  "much", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the [[diminutive]]s "less" and "least".

This system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than ''-ly'' (e.g., "beautiful"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| beautiful || more beautiful || most beautiful
|}

===Absolute adjectives===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}

Some adjectives, the [[ungradable adjective|absolute or ungradable adjectives]] do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either ''present'' or ''absent'', such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything "very Cretaceous", or to characterize something as "more igneous" than something else.

Some grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as ''full'', ''complete'', ''unique'', or ''empty'', which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.

Many [[prescriptive grammar]]s and [[English usage|style guides]] include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as ''more perfect'', ''most unique'', and ''most parallel'' as illogical [[pleonasm]]s: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be "very unique", or "more unique" than something else.

Other style guides argue that terms like ''perfect'' and ''parallel'' never apply ''exactly'' to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean ''nearly perfect'', ''nearly parallel'', and so on; in this sense, ''more perfect'' (''i.e.'', more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and ''more parallel'' (''i.e.'', more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.

==Balto-Slavic languages==
In most [[Balto-Slavic languages]] (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.

In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics ''по-'' (''more'') and ''най-'' (''most''):
:''голям'' (''big'')
:''по-голям'' (''bigger'')
:''най-голям'' (''biggest'')

In [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Slovenian language|Slovene]], comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).
:''mladý'' / ''młody'' / ''mladý'' / '' mlad'' (''young'')
:''mladší'' / ''młodszy'' / ''mladší'' / '' mlajši'' (''younger'')
:''nejmladší'' / ''najmłodszy'' / ''najmladší'' / '' najmlajši '' (''youngest'')

In [[Russian language|Russian]], comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:
:''добрый'' (''kind'')
:''добрее'' (''kinder'')
:''добрейший'' (''kindest'')

==Romance languages==
In contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. "the most beautiful") and absolute (e.g. "very beautiful").

[[French language|French]]: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (''mon'', ''ton'', ''son'', etc.), before "plus" or "moins" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: ''Elle est la plus belle femme'' → (she is the most beautiful woman); ''Cette ville est la moins chère de France'' → (this town is the least expensive in France); ''C'est sa plus belle robe'' → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix "-issime" but only with certain words, for example: "C'est un homme richissime" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] distinguish comparative superlative ''(superlativo relativo)'' and absolute superlative ''(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).
For the comparative superlative they use the words "mais" and "più" between the article and the adjective, like "most" in English.
For the absolute superlative they either use "muito"/"molto" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding ''issimo'' (singular masculine), ''issima'' (singular feminine), ''íssimos''/''issimi'' (plural masculine), or ''íssimas''/''issime'' (plural feminine). For example:
*''Aquele avião é velocíssimo''/''Quell'aeroplano è velocissimo'' → That airplane is very fast
There are some irregular forms for some words ending in "-re" and "-le" (deriving from Latin words ending in "-er" and "-ilis") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending "-re" and they gain the endings ''errimo'' (singular masculine), ''errima'' (singular feminine), ''érrimos''/''errimi'' (plural masculine), or ''érrimas''/''errime'' (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the "-l"/"-le" ending and gain ''ílimo''/''illimo'' (singular masculine), ''ílima''/''illima'' (singular feminine), ''ílimos''/''illimi'' (plural masculine), or ''íli
[[Romanian language|Romanian]], similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word "mai" before the adjective, which operates like "more" or "-er" in English. For example: ''luminos'' → bright, ''mai luminos'' → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word "puțin" (little) is added between "mai" and the adjective, for example ''mai puțin luminos'' → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant "cel" precedes "mai," conjugated as "cel / cei" for male singular / plural and "cea / cele" for female singular / plural. For example: ''cea mai luminoasă stea'' → the brightest star; ''cele mai frumoase fete'' → the most beautiful girls; ''cel mai mic morcov'' → the smallest carrot.

==Celtic languages==
[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an ''e'' to the end and ''i'' before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by "nas" to say "more," and ''as'' to say "most." (The word ''na'' is used to mean ''than''.) Adjectives that begin with ''f'' are lenited.  and ''as'' use different syntax constructions. For example:
Tha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.'' → I am taller than my sisters.
Is mi as àirde.'' → I am the tallest.

As in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.

In other tenses, ''nas'' is replaced by ''na bu'' and ''as'' by ''a bu,'' both of which [[Lenition|lenite]] the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an ''f'' followed by a vowel, the word ''bu'' is reduced to ''b'''. For example:

*''Bha mi na b' àirde na mo pheathraichean.'' → I was taller than my sisters.
*''B' e mi a b' àirde.'' → I was the tallest.

[[Welsh Language|Welsh]] is similar to English in many respects.  The ending ''-af'' is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English ''-est'', and with (most) long words ''mwyaf'' precedes it, as in the English ''most''.  Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular.  Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative ''must'' be used, e.g. of two people - ''John ydy'r talaf'' (John is the tallest).

==Akkadian==
[[Image:AmarnaLetterOfMarriageNegotiation-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|right|240px|thumb|[[Amarna letter EA 19]], Para 2, (last line): "...the Gods and (our Kingly relations), forever"..."''may it be'', (one verb, (5 signs, e-le-[[ni (cuneiform)|né]]-ep-pi)), ''I-n-t-e-r-R-e-l-a-t-e-d''-!." &lt;br&gt;(The first sign "e" is rubbed off; only a space-(depression) locates it.)-(high resolution expandible photo)]]
In [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform]], (on a 12 paragraph [[clay tablet]]), from the [[time period]] of the 1350 BC [[Amarna letters]] (a roughly 20-year [[text corpus|body]] of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral "10," as well as "7 and 7." The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.

The term [[Amarna letters-phrases and quotations#7 times and 7 times again|"7 and 7"]] means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds "more" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, ''Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):'' ''"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times'' '''''more,''''' ''...."''.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{citation
|last = Moran
|first = William L.
|authorlink=William L. Moran
|origyear = 1987|year = 1992
|title = The Amarna Letters
|url = https://www.amazon.com/Amarna-Letters-William-L-Moran/dp/0801867150#reader_0801867150
|edition = 2nd

|isbn = 0-80186-715-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|323–324}} The word 'more' is Akkadian ''mila'', and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is "...over and over again, overflowing," (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).

The numeral 10 is used for ''ten times greater'' in EA 19, ''Love and Gold'', one of King [[Tushratta]]'s eleven letters to the Pharaoh-([[Amenhotep IV]]-''[[Akhenaton]]''). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):

:''".... Now, in keeping with our constant and mutual love, you have made it'' '''10''' ''times greater than the love shown my father. May the gods grant it, and may [[Teshub|Teššup]], my lord, and [[Amun|Aman]] make'' flourish ''for evermore, just as it is now, this mutual love of ours.''&lt;ref name="Moran" /&gt;{{rp|42–46}}

The actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, ''to light up, to rise''), uses: -e-le-[[ni (cuneiform)|né]]-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: ''"...may it be, flourish-our (relations)."''

==Estonian==
In Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with ''kõige'' followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of ''sinine'' 'blue' is ''sinisem'' and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is ''kõige sinisem''. There is also a synthetic ("short") superlative form, which is formed by adding ''-m'' to the end of the plural partitive case. For ''sinine'' the plural partitive form is ''siniseid'' and so ''siniseim'' is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the ''kõige''-form, has a lot of exceptions.

In [[computer science]], '''corecursion''' is a type of operation that is [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is ''[[Generative_recursion#Structural_versus_generative_recursion|generative recursion]]'' which may lack a definite "direction" inherent in corecursion and recursion.

Where recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as [[stream (computing)|stream]]s, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of ''finite'' steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-''productive''. Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example [[recurrence relation]]s such as the factorial.

Corecursion can produce both [[Finite set|finite]] and [[Infinite set|infinite]] [[data structure]]s as results, and may employ [[self-reference|self-referential]] data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with [[lazy evaluation]], to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in [[functional programming]], where corecursion and [[codata (computer science)|codata]] allow [[total language]]s to work with infinite data structures.

== Examples ==
Corecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]] facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and [[Assignment (computer science)|assigned values]] imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.

=== Factorial ===
A classic example of recursion is computing the [[factorial]], which is defined recursively by ''0! := 1'' and ''n! := n × (n - 1)!''.

To ''recursively'' compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) ''itself'' with a different ("smaller" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the ''base case'' has been reached. Thus a [[call stack]] develops in the process. For example, to compute ''fac(3)'', this recursively calls in turn ''fac(2)'', ''fac(1)'', ''fac(0)'' ("winding up" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with ''fac(0) = 1'', and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame ''fac(3)'' that uses the result of ''fac(2) = 2'' to calculate the final result as ''3 × 2 = 3 × fac(2) =: fac(3)'' and finally return ''fac(3) = 6''. In this example a function returns a single value.

This stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial ''corecursively'', as an [[Iteration|iterator]], where one ''starts'' with the case of &lt;math&gt;1 =: 0!&lt;/math&gt;, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers ''1, 2, 3...'' as in the above recursive definition with "time arrow" reversed, as it were, by reading it ''backwards'' as {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;n! \times (n+1) =: (n+1)!&lt;/math&gt;.}} The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a ''stream'' of ''all'' factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]]. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both ''n'' and ''f'' (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt;n, f = (0, 1) : (n + 1, f \times (n+1))&lt;/math&gt;
or in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
  (\(n,f) -&gt; (n+1, f*(n+1))) `iterate` (0,1)
&lt;/source&gt;
meaning, "starting from &lt;math&gt;n, f = 0, 1&lt;/math&gt;, on each step the next values are calculated as &lt;math&gt;n+1, f \times (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;". This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; emphasizes that the factorial values are being built ''up'', going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, ''down'' to the base case, with a &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; decrement. Note also that the direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index ''n'' in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed.

Note the connection with [[denotational semantics]], where the [[Denotational semantics#Denotations of recursive programs|denotations of recursive programs]] is built up corecursively in this way.

In Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as:{{efn|Not validating input data.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This could then be called for example as &lt;code&gt;factorial(5)&lt;/code&gt; to compute ''5!''.

A corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def factorials():
    n, f = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield f
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def n_factorials(k):
    n, f = 0, 1
    while n &lt;= k:
        yield f
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This could then be called to produce the factorials up to ''5!'' via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for f in n_factorials(5):
    print(f)
&lt;/source&gt;
If we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function,
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def nth_factorial(k):
    n, f = 0, 1
    while n &lt; k:
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
    yield f
&lt;/source&gt;
As can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; for the only &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; there) to the accumulator argument technique for [[tail call|tail recursion]], unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.

=== Fibonacci sequence ===
In the same way, the [[Fibonacci sequence]] can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt;a, b = (0, 1) : (b, a+b)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that because the Fibonacci sequence is a [[recurrence relation]] of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the &lt;math&gt;(b, -)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the &lt;math&gt;(-, a+b)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using [[parallel assignment]]):
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
&lt;/source&gt;
In Haskell, &lt;source lang=haskell&gt; map fst ( (\(a,b) -&gt; (b,a+b)) `iterate` (0,1) )&lt;/source&gt;

=== Tree traversal ===
[[Tree traversal]] via a [[depth-first]] approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, [[breadth-first]] traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion.

Without using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node, placing its child nodes in a data structure, then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure.{{efn|More elegantly, one can start by placing the root node itself in the data structure and then starting the process.}} If the data structure is a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and  if the data structure is a [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]] (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal.

Using recursion, a (post-order){{efn|Post-order is to make "leaf node is base case" explicit for exposition, but the same analysis works for pre-order or in-order.}} depth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) – the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over.

Using corecursion, a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value,{{efn|Breadth-first traversal, unlike depth-first, is unambiguous, and visits a node value before processing children.}} then breadth-first traversing the subtrees – i.e., passing on the ''whole list'' of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) – at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc.{{efn|Technically, one may define a breadth-first traversal on an ordered, disconnected set of trees – first the root node of each tree, then the children of each tree in turn, then the grandchildren in turn, etc.}} In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example (above), where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, ''n'') was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of ''n''!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically:
:&lt;math&gt;v, t = ([], FullTree) : (RootValues, ChildTrees)&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values of root nodes, then proceeds to the child subtrees. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). In Haskell, 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt; concatMap fst ( (\(v, t) -&gt; (rootValues t, childTrees t)) `iterate` ([], fullTree) )&lt;/source&gt;

These can be compared as follows. The recursive traversal handles a ''leaf node'' (at the ''bottom'') as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and ''analyzes'' a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes – actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off ''below''). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a ''root node'' (at the ''top'') as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being ''synthesized'' of a root node and its children, then produces as auxiliary output a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step – the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off ''above''). Note also that in the recursive traversal there is a distinction between leaf nodes and branch nodes, while in the corecursive traversal there is no distinction, as each node is treated as the root node of the subtree it defines.

Notably, given an infinite tree,{{efn|Assume fixed [[branching factor]] (e.g., binary), or at least bounded, and balanced (infinite in every direction).}} the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures.

In Python, this can be implemented as follows.{{efn|First defining a tree class, say via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
class Tree:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left  = left
        self.right = right

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)
&lt;/source&gt;
and initializing a tree, say via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
t = Tree(1, Tree(2, Tree(4), Tree(5)), Tree(3, Tree(6), Tree(7)))
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example nodes are labeled in breadth-first order:
     1
  2     3
 4 5   6 7
}}
The usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as:{{efn|Intuitively, the function iterates over subtrees (possibly empty), then once these are finished, all that is left is the node itself, whose value is then returned; this corresponds to treating a leaf node as basic.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def df(node):
    if node is not None:
        df(node.left)
        df(node.right)
        print(node.value)
&lt;/source&gt;
This can then be called by &lt;code&gt;df(t)&lt;/code&gt; to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order.

The breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as:{{efn|1=Here the argument (and loop variable) is considered as a whole, possible infinite tree, represented by (identified with) its root node (tree = root node), rather than as a potential leaf node, hence the choice of variable name.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def bf(tree):
    tree_list = [tree]
    while tree_list:
        new_tree_list = []
        for tree in tree_list:
            if tree is not None:
                yield tree.value
                new_tree_list.append(tree.left)
                new_tree_list.append(tree.right)
        tree_list = new_tree_list
&lt;/source&gt;
This can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for i in bf(t):
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Definition==
{{technical|section|date=November 2010}}
[[Initial and terminal objects|Initial data type]]s can be defined as being the [[least fixpoint]] ([[up to isomorphism]]) of some type equation; the [[isomorphism]] is then given by an [[Initial algebra|initial]] [[F-algebra|algebra]]. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the [[greatest fixpoint]] of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final [[F-coalgebra|coalgebra]].

If the domain of discourse is the [[category of sets]] and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, [[Non-well-founded set theory|non-wellfounded]] values, whereas initial types do not.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise and Moss 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moss and Danner 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of [[complete partial order]]s and [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]], which corresponds roughly to the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth and Plotkin 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary [[recursion]] recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons and Hutton 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--G&amp;H ascribe this definition to Barwise and Moss--&gt;

The discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell.&lt;ref&gt;Doets and van Eijck 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Also note that the examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is.

The rule for ''primitive corecursion'' on [[codata (computer science)|codata]] is the dual to that for [[primitive recursion]] on data. Instead of descending on the argument by [[pattern-matching]] on its constructors (that ''were called up before'', somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. "fields"), we ascend on the result by filling-in its "destructors" (or "observers", that ''will be called afterwards'', somewhere - so we're actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion ''creates'' (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion ''analyses'' (necessarily finite) data.  Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate.  Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite.

In "Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes"&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc and Paulin-Mohring, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; we find
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
hd (conc a s) = a               
tl (conc a s) = s

(sieve p s) = if div p (hd s) then sieve p (tl s)
              else conc (hd s) (sieve p (tl s))

hd (primes s) = (hd s)          
tl (primes s) = primes (sieve (hd s) (tl s))
&lt;/source&gt;
where primes "are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)". Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as 
:&lt;math&gt;p, s = (0, [2..]) : (hd(s), sieve(hd(s),tl(s)))&lt;/math&gt;
or in Haskell, 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
(\(p, s@(h:t)) -&gt; (h, sieve h t)) `iterate` (0, [2..])
&lt;/source&gt;
The authors discuss how the definition of &lt;code&gt;sieve&lt;/code&gt; is not guaranteed always to be ''productive'', and could become stuck e.g. if called with &lt;code&gt;[5,10..]&lt;/code&gt; as the initial stream.

Here is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of [[Fibonacci numbers]] in linear time:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
&lt;/source&gt;

This infinite list depends on lazy evaluation;  elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming.

This can be done in Python as well:&lt;ref&gt;Hettinger 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
from itertools import tee, chain, islice, imap

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def fibonacci():
    def deferred_output():
        for i in output:
            yield i
    result, c1, c2 = tee(deferred_output(), 3)
    paired = imap(add, c1, islice(c2, 1, None))
    output = chain([0, 1], paired)
    return result

for i in islice(fibonacci(), 20):
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

The definition of &lt;code&gt;zipWith&lt;/code&gt; can be inlined, leading to this:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
  where
    next (a: t@(b:_)) = (a+b):next t
&lt;/source&gt;

This example employs a self-referential ''data structure''.   Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential ''functions'',   but does not accommodate self-referential data.   However,  this is not essential to the Fibonacci example.    It can be rewritten as follows:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = fibgen (0,1)
fibgen (x,y) = x : fibgen (y,x+y) 
&lt;/source&gt;

This employs only self-referential ''function'' to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with [[lazy evaluation|non-strict]] list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list.

{{anchor|corecursive queue breadth-first tree traversal}}Corecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queue&lt;ref&gt;Allison 1989; Smith 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a particularly good example of this phenomenon.   The following definition produces a [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first traversal]] of a binary tree in linear time:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree a b = Leaf a  |  Branch b (Tree a b) (Tree a b)

bftrav :: Tree a b -&gt; [Tree a b]
bftrav tree = queue
  where
    queue = tree : gen 1 queue

    gen  0   p                 =         []           
    gen len (Leaf   _     : s) =         gen (len-1) s 
    gen len (Branch _ l r : s) = l : r : gen (len+1) s  
&lt;/source&gt;

This definition takes an initial tree and produces a list of subtrees.   This list serves dual purpose as both the queue and the result (&lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;gen len p&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; produces its output &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; notches after its input back-pointer, &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;, along the &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;queue&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;).  It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite.  The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination;  this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees.  &lt;!-- Even if the result is finite, this example depends on lazy evaluation due to the use of self-referential data structures.

why the above was removed: it isn't true: the Haskell code can be translated into Prolog quite straightforwardly. Prolog is not a lazy language. But it does have tail recursion modulo cons. Which is emulatable in Scheme, C, etc.

bftrav(Tree,Q):- Q=[Tree|R], bfgen(1,Q,R).
bfgen(0,_,[]):- !.
bfgen(N,[leaf(_)        |P], R       ):- N2 is N-1, bfgen(N2,P,R).
bfgen(N,[branch(_,Lt,Rt)|P],[Lt,Rt|R]):- N2 is N+1, bfgen(N2,P,R).
--&gt;

Another particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Gibbons 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The function &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion,  and replaces each label with an integer,  each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one.   This solution employs a self-referential data structure,  and the binary tree can be finite or infinite.

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
label :: Tree a b -&gt; Tree Int Int 
label t = t′
    where
    (t′, ns) = go t (1:ns)

    go :: Tree a b    -&gt; [Int]  -&gt; (Tree Int Int, [Int])
    go   (Leaf   _    ) (n:ns) = (Leaf   n       , n+1 : ns  )
    go   (Branch _ l r) (n:ns) = (Branch n l′ r′ , n+1 : ns′′)
                                where
                                  (l′, ns′ ) = go l ns
                                  (r′, ns′′) = go r ns′
&lt;/source&gt;

An [[apomorphism]] (such as an [[anamorphism]], such as [[Unfold (higher-order function)|unfold]]) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a [[paramorphism]] (such as a [[catamorphism]], such as [[Fold (higher-order function)|fold]]) is a form of recursion.

The [[Coq]] proof assistant supports corecursion and [[coinduction]] using the CoFixpoint command.

== History ==
Corecursion, referred to as ''circular programming,'' dates at least to {{Harv|Bird|1984}}, who credits [[John Hughes (computer scientist)|John Hughes]] and [[Philip Wadler]]; more general forms were developed in {{Harv|Allison|1989}}. The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing 1 pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.

{{wiktionary}}
The term '''cross-reference''' can refer to either:
* An instance within a [[document]] which refers to related information elsewhere in the same document. In both printed and online dictionaries cross-references are important because they form a network structure of relations existing between different parts of data, dictionary-internal as well as dictionary external.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Nielsen (1999): "Mediostructures in Bilingual LSP Dictionaries." In: ''Lexicographica. International Annual for Lexicography'' 15, 90–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a cross reference is often denoted by ''See also''.  For example, under the term ''Albert Einstein'' in the index of a book about Nobel Laureates, there may be the cross-reference ''See also: Einstein, Albert''.
* In [[hypertext]], cross-referencing is maintained to a document with either in-context (XRIC) or out-of-context (''XROC'') cross-referencing.  These are similar to [[Key Word in Context|KWIC and KWOC]].
* In programming, "cross-referencing" means the listing of every file name and line number where a given [[identifier#In computer science|named identifier]] occurs within the program's [[source tree]].
* In a [[relational database management system]], a table can have an xref as prefix or suffix to indicate it is a [[cross-reference table]] that joins two or more tables together via [[primary key]].

== Structure of a cross reference ==
In a document, especially those authored in a [[Content management system]],
a cross-reference has two major aspects:
* A visible form that appears when the document is presented to the reader
* A technical mechanism that resides within the system

The visible form contains text, graphics, and other indications that:
* Enable the reader to follow the cross reference to the referenced content
* May enable the reader to understand what is being referred to, or what to expect upon following the reference
* May present to the reader some information from the referenced content

The technical mechanism that resides within the system:
* Identifies what location is being referred to
* Permits the system to present appropriate referencing text when the location containing the reference is presented to a reader
* Permits the system to offer a control (such as a link) that a reader can use when the content is presented in electronic form to access the referenced content

== How cross references contribute to usability of a document or set of documents ==
If the cross reference mechanism is well designed, the reader will be able to follow each cross reference to the referenced content whether the content is presented in print or electronically.

An author working in a content management system is responsible for identifying subjects of interest that cross documents, and creating appropriate systems of cross references to support readers who seek to understand those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rockley|first1=Ann|last2=Cooper|first2=Charles|title=Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy|date=2012|publisher=New Riders|isbn=978-0321815361|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual cross reference, an author should ensure that location and content of the target of the cross reference are clearly identified, and the reader can easily determine how to follow the cross reference in each medium in which publication is supported.

[[Content strategy]] practitioners (known as content strategists) specialize in planning content to meet business needs, taking into account the processes for creating and maintaining the content, and the systems that support the content.

A '''dictionary''', sometimes known as a '''wordbook''', is a collection of [[word]]s in one or more specific [[language]]s, often arranged [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] (or by [[radical-and-stroke sorting|radical and stroke]] for [[ideographic]] languages), which may include information on [[definition]]s, usage, [[etymologies]], [[pronunciation]]s, translation, etc.&lt;ref name = Web1&gt;Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a [[lexicon]].&lt;ref name = Web1/&gt; It is a [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Nielsen, Sandro |year = 2008 |title = The Effect of Lexicographical Information Costs on Dictionary Naming and Use | url = | journal = Lexikos |volume = 18 |issn= 1684-4904 |pages = 170–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad distinction is made between general and [[specialized dictionaries]]. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether [[lexicology]] and [[terminology]] are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} to be [[Semasiology|semasiological]], mapping word to [[definition]], while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be [[Onomasiology|onomasiological]], first identifying [[concept]]s and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types.&lt;ref name="Sterkenburg2003"&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt; There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance [[bilingual dictionary|bilingual (translation) dictionaries]], dictionaries of [[synonym]]s ([[thesaurus|thesauri]]), and [[rhyming]] dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose [[monolingual dictionary]].&lt;ref name=Sintro&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a contrast between [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']] dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. "informal" or "vulgar") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first recorded dictionaries date back to [[Sumer]]ian times (these were bilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest themselves is a 20th-century enterprise, called [[lexicography]], and largely initiated by [[Ladislav Zgusta]].&lt;ref name=Sintro/&gt; The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of "astonishing" lack of method and critical-self reflection.&lt;ref name="Hartmann2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. R. K. Hartmann|title=Lexicography: Dictionaries, compilers, critics, and users|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLlhyvpg7KoC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-25366-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest known dictionaries were [[Akkadian Empire]] cuneiform tablets with bilingual [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]–[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] wordlists, discovered in [[Ebla]] (modern [[Syria]]) and dated roughly 2300 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name="imlqdg"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html#p3 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbLyr75?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early 2nd millennium BCE ''[[Urra=hubullu]]'' glossary is the canonical [[Babylonia]]n version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A [[Chinese dictionary]], the c. 3rd century BCE ''[[Erya]]'', was the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; although some sources cite the c. 800 BCE [[Shizhoupian]] as a "dictionary", modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of [[Chinese character]]s from [[Zhou dynasty]] bronzes. [[Philitas of Cos]] (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary ''Disorderly Words'' (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Átaktoi glôssai}}'') which explained the meanings of rare [[Homer]]ic and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Peter Bing |title= The unruly tongue: Philitas of Cos as scholar and poet |journal= Classical Philology |volume=98 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=330–348 |doi=10.1086/422370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollonius the Sophist]] (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon.&lt;ref name = "imlqdg"/&gt; The first [[Sanskrit]] dictionary, the [[Amarakosha|Amarakośa]], was written by [[Amara Sinha]] c. 4th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the first [[Japanese dictionaries#Early Japanese lexicography|Japanese dictionary]] was the long-lost 682 CE ''Niina'' glossary of Chinese characters. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the c. 835 CE ''[[Tenrei Banshō Meigi]]'', was also a glossary of written Chinese. In ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig]]'', [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Heterogram (linguistics)|heterograms]] are listed together with their translation in [[Middle Persian]] language and phonetic transcription in [[Pazand]] alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, [[Sanas Cormaic]], contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In India around 1320, [[Amir Khusro]] compiled the Khaliq-e-bari which mainly dealt with [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rashid|first=Omar|title=Chasing Khusro|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3672990.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nouveau Dictionnaire Larousse page.JPG|thumb|The French-language ''[[Petit Larousse]]'' is an example of an illustrated dictionary.]]

[[Arabic]] dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the [[root (linguistics)|radicals]], or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]], while most general use dictionaries, such as the ''Lisan al-`Arab'' (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and ''al-Qamus al-Muhit'' (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The ''Qamus al-Muhit'' is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the ''Lisan'' and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Ḳāmūs", J. Eckmann, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd ed., Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vocabolario degli accademici della crusca, prima edizione per giovanni alberti, venezia 1612, 01.jpg|thumb|300px|left|1612 ''Vocabolario dell'[[Accademia della Crusca]]'']]
In medieval Europe, [[glossary|glossaries]] with equivalents for Latin words in [[vernacular]] or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the [[Leiden Glossary]]). The ''[[Catholicon (1286)|Catholicon]]'' (1287) by [[John of Genoa|Johannes Balbus]], a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 [[Ambrogio Calepino]]'s ''Dictionarium'' was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 [[Robert Estienne]] published the ''Thesaurus linguae latinae'' and in 1572 his son [[Henri Estienne]] published the ''[[Thesaurus linguae graecae]]'', which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by [[Sebastián Covarrubias]]' ''[[Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española]]'', published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española'', edición integral e ilustrada de Ignacio Arellano y Rafael Zafra, Madrid, Iberoamericana-Vervuert, 2006, pg. XLIX.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1612 the first edition of the ''[[Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca]]'', for [[italian language|Italian]], was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in [[Rotterdam]] was published, posthumously, the ''Dictionnaire Universel'' by [[Antoine Furetière]] for [[french language|French]]. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]''. Between 1712 and 1721 was published the ''Vocabulario portughez e latino'' written by Raphael Bluteau. The [[Real Academia Española]] published the first edition of the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'' in 1780, but their ''Diccionario de Autoridades'', which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The ''Totius Latinitatis lexicon'' by [[Egidio Forcellini]] was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.

The first edition of ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' by [[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the [[Deutsches Wörterbuch]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]]; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the ''Dizionario della lingua italiana'' by [[Niccolò Tommaseo]]. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of ''A magyar nyelv szótára'' (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. [[Émile Littré]] published the [[Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Dictionnaire de la langue française]] between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'' which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 [[Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl]] published the ''[[Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language]]''. The [[Duden]] dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the [[prescriptive]] source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordbok]]'' was taken in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/|title=OSA – Om svar anhålles|website=g3.spraakdata.gu.se|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English dictionaries in Britain===

The earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word "dictionary" was invented by an Englishman called [[John of Garland]] in 1220 — he had written a book ''[[Dictionarius (Johannes de Garlandia)|Dictionarius]]'' to help with Latin "diction".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Forsyth. The etymologicon. // Icon Books Ltd. London N79DP, 2011. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the ''Elementarie'', created by [[Richard Mulcaster]] in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/dic/mul/elementarie.html|title=1582 - Mulcaster's Elementarie|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html A Brief History of English Lexicography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309181613/http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html |date=2008-03-09 }}, Peter Erdmann and See-Young Cho, [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Universität Berlin]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was ''[[Table Alphabeticall|A Table Alphabeticall]]'', written by English schoolteacher [[Robert Cawdrey]] in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]]. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is "a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html Jack Lynch, “How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary” (delivered 25 August 2005 at the Johnson and the English Language conference, Birmingham)] Retrieved July 12, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his "English Expositor". ''Glossographia'' by [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]], published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. [[Edward Phillips]] wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled "[[The New World of English Words]]: Or a General Dictionary" which boldly [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] Blount's work, and the two denounced {{clarify|date=November 2016}} each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. [[John Wilkins]]' 1668 [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|essay on philosophical language]] contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John P. Considine|title=Dictionaries in Early Modern Europe: Lexicography and the Making of Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqBkQFiTbX4C&amp;pg=PA298|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=27 March 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88674-1|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisha Coles]] published his "English Dictionary" in 1676.

It was not until [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy.&lt;ref name = "wblqfm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html|title=Lynch, "How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary"|website=andromeda.rutgers.edu|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first "modern" dictionary.&lt;ref name = "wblqfm"/&gt;

Johnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the [[Oxford University Press]] began writing and releasing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in short [[wikt:fascicle|fascicles]] from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to complete this huge work, and they finally released the complete ''OED'' in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, [[William Chester Minor]], a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American English dictionaries===
In 1806, American [[Noah Webster]] published his first dictionary, ''[[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language]]''. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language;'' it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and [[Sanskrit]].

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced [[American English]] spellings, replacing "colour" with "color", substituting "wagon" for "waggon", and printing "center" instead of "centre". He also added American words, like "skunk" and "squash", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.

==Types==

In a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425064041/http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the [[lemma (morphology)|undeclined or unconjugated]] form appears as the [[headword]] in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like [[StarDict]] and the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' are dictionary software running on [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] or [[computer]]s. There are also many [[List of online dictionaries|online dictionaries]] accessible via the [[Internet]].

===Specialized dictionaries===
{{main|Specialized dictionary}}
According to the ''Manual of Specialized Lexicographies'', a [[specialized dictionary]], also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in ''The Bilingual LSP Dictionary'', [[lexicographers]] categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A [[multi-field dictionary]] broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a [[business dictionary]]), a [[single-field dictionary]] narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a [[sub-field dictionary]] covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language [[Inter-Active Terminology for Europe]] is a multi-field dictionary, the [[American National Biography]] is a single-field, and the [[African American National Biography Project]] is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between "minimizing dictionaries" and "maximizing dictionaries", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]'' and ''[[Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|title=The first English to Einglish and Sindhi Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms published - The Sindh Times|first=The Sindh|last=Times|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011021439/http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'').

Another variant is the [[glossary]], an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine ([[medical dictionary]]).

===Defining dictionaries===
The simplest dictionary, a [[defining dictionary]], provides a [[core glossary]] of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English [[idiom]]s and [[metaphor]]s, can be defined.

===Prescriptive vs. descriptive===
Lexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']]. [[Noah Webster]], intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why [[American English]] now uses the spelling ''color'' while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers ''colour''. (Similarly, [[British English]] subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at [[American and British English spelling differences]].)&lt;ref name="Benson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Benson|title=Ethnocentrism and the English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeuW7oy7-58C&amp;pg=PA8|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large 20th-century dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) and ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's Third]]'' are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, and information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ingrid Tieken-Boon van Ostade|author2=Wim van der Wurff|title=Current Issues in Late Modern English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x91EUnnWwR8C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, ''sometimes offensive'' or ''stand'' (nonstandard). ''[[American Heritage Dictionary|American Heritage]]'' goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous "usage notes." ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|Encarta]]'' provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, "an offensive term for..." or "a taboo term meaning...".

Because of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Halley, ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Modern English Grammar'' (2005), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jorge Luis Borges]] says in the prologue to "El otro, el mismo": "''It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.''"

Sometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the ''Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary'' is "at war with itself": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its [[Niqqud|vocalization]] is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as ''hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít'' (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas ''hi taharóg otí'', literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (1999). [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/review-of-the-oxford-english-hebrew- Review of the Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary], ''[[International Journal of Lexicography]]'' 12.4, pp. 325-346.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical dictionaries ===
A [[historical dictionary]] is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.

===Dictionaries for natural language processing===
In contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for [[natural language processing]] (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see [[Diathesis alternation]]). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control [[machine translation]]s or [[cross-lingual information retrieval]] (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called [[Lexical Markup Framework]] (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.

==Pronunciation==
{{Main|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects|Pronunciation respelling for English}}
In many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently  apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word ''dictionary'' might be followed by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] spelling {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|ʃ|ə|n|ɛr|i}}. American English dictionaries often use their own[[pronunciation respelling]] systems with [[diacritic]]s, for example ''dictionary''  is respelled as "dĭk'''′'''shə-nĕr′ē" in the [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]].{{refn|{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|dictionary}}}} The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, ''dictionary'' may be respelled as {{respell|DIK|shə|nerr|ee}}. Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.

==Online dictionaries==

The age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. [[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]] in 2013 noted that "Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are 'holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric' and 'bourgeois.' Teaching users about words they don’t already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]], [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/the-role-of-a-dictionary/?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20130518  The Role of a Dictionary] in "Opinionator: Exclusive Online Commentary from the Times", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of [[neologisms]]. Some of the more notable examples include:

'''Digital reference''' (or '''virtual reference''') is a service by which a [[library]] reference service is conducted online, and the reference transaction is a [[computer-mediated communication]]. It is the remote, NextNextcomputer-mediated delivery of reference information provided by library professionals to users who cannot access or do not want face-to-face communication. Virtual reference service is most often an extension of a library's existing reference service program. The word "[[reference]]" in this context refers to the task of providing assistance to library users in finding information, answering questions, and otherwise fulfilling users’ information needs. Reference work often but not always involves using [[reference work]]s, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc.  This form of reference work expands reference services from the physical reference desk to a "virtual" reference desk where the patron could be writing from home, work or a variety of other locations.

The terminology surrounding virtual reference services may involve multiple terms used for the same definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pace |first=A. |title=Virtual Reference: What's in a Name? |journal=Computers in Libraries |date=April 2003 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred term for remotely delivered, computer-mediated reference services is "virtual reference", with the secondary non-preferred term "digital reference" having gone out of use in recent years. "Chat reference" is often used interchangeably with virtual reference, although it represents only one aspect of virtual reference. Virtual reference includes the use of both synchronous (i.e., IM, videoconferencing) and asynchronous communication (i.e., texting and email). Here, "synchronous virtual reference" refers to any real-time computer-mediated communication between patron and information professional. Asynchronous virtual reference is all computer-mediated communication that is sent and received at different times.&lt;ref name="Kern"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kern |first=M.K. |title=Virtual Reference Best Practices: Tailoring Services to Your Library |place=Chicago |publisher=ALA |year=2009}} {{ISBN|978-0-8389-0975-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest digital reference services were launched in the mid-1980s, primarily by academic and medical libraries, and provided by [[e-mail]]. These early-adopter libraries launched digital reference services for two main reasons: to extend the hours that questions could be submitted to the reference desk, and to explore the potential of campus-wide networks, which at that time was a new technology.

With the advent of the graphical [[World Wide Web]], libraries quickly adopted webforms for question submission. Since then, the percentage of questions submitted to services via webforms has outstripped the percentage submitted via email.

In the early- to mid-1990s, digital reference services began to appear that were not affiliated with any library. These digital reference services are often referred to as "AskA" services. Examples of AskA services are the [[Internet Public Library]], [http://mathforum.org/dr.math/ Ask Dr. Math], and [http://americanart.si.edu/search/search_ajoa.cfm Ask Joan of Art].

Providing remote-based services for patrons has been a steady practice of libraries over the years.  For example, before the widespread use of chat software, reference questions were often answered via phone, fax, email and audio conferencing. Email is the oldest type of virtual reference service used by libraries.&lt;ref name="Kern" /&gt; Library services in America and the UK are just now gaining visibility in their use of virtual reference services using chat software. However, a survey in America revealed that by 2001 over 200 libraries were using chat reference services.&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=G.G. |title=Librarianship: an introduction |place=London |publisher=Facet |year=2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The rapid global proliferation of information technology (IT) often leaves libraries at a disadvantage in terms of keeping their services current. However, libraries are always striving to understand their user demographics in order to provide the best possible services.&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brophy |first=P. |title=The library in the twenty-first century |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=Facet |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, libraries continue to take notes from current [[cyberculture]] and are continually incorporating a diversified range of interactive technologies in their service repertoires. Virtual reference represents only one small part of a larger library mission to meet the needs of a new generation, sometimes referred to as the "Google Generation", of users who have grown up with the internet.&lt;ref name="Row"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rowlands |first=I. |title=The Google generation: the information behaviour of the researcher of the future |journal=Aslib Proceedings |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=290–310 |year=2008 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1733495&amp;show=abstract |doi=10.1108/00012530810887953}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, virtual reference may be used in conjunction with embedded [[Web 2.0]] (online social media such as [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[blogs]], [[del.icio.us]], [[Flickr]], etc.) applications in a library's suite of online services.&lt;ref name="Xiao"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Xiao |first=N. |title=Web 2.0 as catalyst: Virtually reaching out to users and connecting them to library resources and services |journal=Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship |volume=55 |issue=Fall |year=2008 |url=http://www.istl.org/08-fall/article2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technological innovations continue, libraries will be watching to find new, more personalized ways of interacting with remote reference users.

The range of cost-per-transaction of reference interactions has been found to be large, due to the differences in librarian salaries and infrastructural costs required by reference interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Murfin, Marjorie E. "Cost Analysis of Library Reference Services," Advances in Library Administration and Organization, 11, 1993, pp. 1–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, Lorraine, &amp; Pomerantz, Jeffrey. "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/pla.0.0035 Virtual Reference, Real Money: Modeling Costs in Virtual Reference Services]," portal: Libraries and the Academy, 9, 2009, pp. 133-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of digital reference==

===Webforms===
Webforms are created for digital reference services in order to help the patron be more productive in asking their question.  This document helps the librarian locate exactly what the patron is asking for.  Creation of webforms requires design consideration.  Because webforms substitute for the reference interview, receiving as much information as possible from the patron is a key function.

Aspects commonly found within webforms:

*A return email address to send the answer to the question
*The question being asked
*The type of question
*What sources have been consulted by the patron
*How the patron is planning to use the information
*Location of the patron (are they a library patron?)
*A name to personalize the interaction
*A date by which the information is needed
*The type of sources being requested (print or electronic)&lt;ref&gt;Janes, Joseph. "Introduction to Reference Work in the Digital Age", pages 64-65. Neal-Schuman Publishers Inc., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chat using commercial applications===
Several applications exist for providing chat-based reference. Some of these applications are: [http://www.questionpoint.org/ QuestionPoint], [https://www.omnireference.com/ OmniReference], [http://tutor.com/ Tutor.com], [https://libraryh3lp.com/ LibraryH3lp], [http://aspiringkidz.com/ AspiringKidz.com], and [http://Vienova.com/ Vienova.com]. These applications bear a resemblance to commercial help desk applications. These applications possess functionality such as: chat, co-browsing of webpages, webpage and document pushing, customization of pre-scripted messages, storage of chat transcripts, and statistical reporting.

===Chat using instant messaging===
{{See also|chatbot|virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)}}
[[Instant messaging]] (IM) services are used by some libraries as a low-cost means of offering chat-based reference, since most IM services are free.  Utilizing IM for reference services allows a patron to contact the library from any location via the internet.  This service is like the traditional reference interview because it is a live interaction between the patron and the librarian.  On the other side the reference interview is different because the conversation does not float away but instead is in print on the screen for the librarian to review if needed to better understand the patron.  IM reference services may be for the use of in-house patrons as well as patrons unable to go to the library. If library computers support IM chat programs, patrons may IM from within the library to avoid losing their use of a computer or avoid making embarrassing questions public.

Successful IM reference services will:
*Create a profile to convey information about the library and increase online presence.
*Accept imperfection in conversations without spending time to go back and make corrections.  Most words are recognizable through context.
*Become familiar with and use accepted IM abbreviations such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud).
*Don't panic.  While speed is important it is more important to not feel rushed.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rick. "IM Me", Library Journal 130 (April 1, 2005): 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, IM becomes challenging because of lack of non-verbal cues such as eye contact, and the perceived time pressure. Moreover, formulating the question online without the give and take of nonverbal cues and face to face conversation presents an added obstacle. In addition, to provide effective reference service through IM, it is important to meet higher level of information literacy standards. These standards include evaluating the information and its source, synthesizing the information to create new ideas or products, and understanding the societal, legal, and economic issues surrounding its use.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Christina M. &amp; Graves, Stephanie J. "Instruction via Instant Messaging reference: what’s happening?", The Electronic Library 24 (2) ( 2006): 174-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software for providing digital reference==
The article [http://slj.reviewsnews.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA251679 Live, Digital Reference Marketplace] by Buff Hirko contains a comparison of the features of applications for chat-based reference.

See the entries in the [http://www.libsuccess.org/index.php?title=Online_Reference Library Success Wiki's Online Reference Section], including software recommended for web-based chat reference, IM reference, SMS (text messaging) reference, and other types like digital audio or video reference.

===Software features===
Virtual service software programs offered by libraries are often unique, and tailored to the individual library's needs.&lt;ref name="Bro" /&gt; However, each program may have several distinct features. A [[knowledge base]] is a chunk of information that users can access independently. An example of this is a serialized listing of [[frequently asked questions]] (FAQ) that a user can read and use at his or her leisure.

Online chat, or [[instant messaging]] (IM) has become a very popular Web-based feature.  Instant messaging is a real time conversation that utilizes typed text instead of language.  Users may feel a sense of satisfaction with the use of this tool because of their personalized interaction with staff.

The use of electronic mail (email) in responding to reference questions in libraries has been in use for years.  Also, in some cases with the IM feature, a question may be asked that cannot be resolved in online chat.  In this instance the staff member may document the inquiring patron’s email address and will the user a response.

With the increase in use of text messaging ([[Short Message Service]] or SMS), some libraries are also adopting text messaging in their virtual reference services. [[Librarian]]s can use mobile phones, text-to-instant messaging or web-based services to respond to reference questions via text messaging.

[[Co-browsing]], or cooperative browsing, is a virtual reference function that involves interactive control of a user’s web browser. This function enables the librarian to see what the patron has on his or her computer screen. Several types of co-browsing have been offered in mobile devices of late; libraries may have software that incorporates dual modes of co-browsing in a variety of formats. For instance, it is possible to browse on a mobile device within and between documents (such as Word), webpages, and images.&lt;ref name="Hua"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hua |first=Z. |title="Chapter 2.10: A Cooperative Framework for Information Browsing in Mobile Environment". In: Taniar, D. (2008) Mobile Computing: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications |place=London |publisher=Information Science Reference |pages=497–505 |year=2008 |url=http://www.igi-global.com/reference|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The UK==

Virtual reference services are growing in popularity in the UK with more institutions accepting queries via email, instant messaging and other chat based services.&lt;ref name="Barry, E 2010 pp.40-55"&gt;Barry, E et al (2010) Virtual Reference in UK academic libraries: The virtual enquiry project 2008–2009, Library Review, Vol. 59 (1) pp.40-55&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the use of virtual reference within UK academic institutions showed that 25% currently offer a form of virtual reference, with 54% of academic institutions surveyed considering adding this service.&lt;ref name="Barry, E 2010 pp.40-55"/&gt;

UK public libraries were instrumental in some of the first steps towards UK-wide internet collaboration amongst libraries with the EARL Consortium (Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries) in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, S. (1998) Delivering the New Public Library: the role of the EARL Consortium, INFOCUS 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt; in a time where internet access was a rare commodity for both library staff and the public. Resources were collated and lines of communication opened between libraries across the UK, paving the way for services all over the world to follow suit. There are now a number of area-specific reference services across the UK including Ask A Librarian (UK-wide, established in 1997), Ask Cymru (Welsh and English language service), Enquire (Government funded through the People's Network, also UK-wide),&lt;ref&gt;Berube, L. (2005) People's Network Enquire: virtual reference in England, World Library and Information Congress: 71st IFLA General Conference and Council, August 14th - 18th 2005, Oslo, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ask Scotland. Ask Scotland was created by the Scottish Government's advisory body on libraries, SLIC (Scottish Library and Information Council),&lt;ref&gt;SLIC homepage: http://www.slainte.org.uk/slic/slicindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and funded by the Public Library Quality Improvement Fund (PLQIF) in June 2009. It uses the [[Online Computer Library Center]]'s QuestionPoint software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questionpoint.org/ QuestionPoint.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Library Association's digital reference guidelines==
The definition formulated by the American Library Association's (ALA) 2004 MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee contains three components:

# "Virtual reference is reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time, where patrons employ computers or other Internet technology to communicate with reference staff, without being physically present. Communication channels used frequently in virtual reference include chat, videoconferencing, Voice over IP, co-browsing, e-mail, and instant messaging.
# While online sources are often utilized in provision of virtual reference, use of electronic sources in seeking answers is not of itself virtual reference.
# Virtual reference queries are sometimes followed-up with telephone, fax, in-person and regular mail interactions, even though these modes of communication are not considered virtual."&lt;ref name="MARS"&gt;{{cite journal |author=MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee |year=2004 |title=Guidelines for Implementing and Maintaining Virtual Reference Services |journal=Reference and User Services Quarterly |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/rusa/resources/guidelines/virtrefguidelines.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 [[QuestionPoint]] and the [[American Library Association]] were in talks about offering a National Ask A Librarian service across the whole United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;http://questionpoint.blogs.com/questionpoint_247_referen/2011/01/a-national-virtual-reference-service-for-the-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; At present the Ask services in the US are run at a local level.

==Other countries==
In Europe some countries offer services in both their own national language and in English. European countries include: Finland,&lt;ref&gt;Finnish National Libraries online reference service: http://www.libraries.fi/en-GB/ask/&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands (in Dutch only),&lt;ref&gt;The Netherlands online reference service: http://www2.bibliotheek.nl/home&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Danish Libraries homepage, with links to a virtual reference form: http://bibliotek.dk/?lingo=eng&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;Public library of Lyon, France: http://www.guichetdusavoir.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries which offer virtual reference services include: Australia,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Australia's Ask a Librarian service: http://www.nla.gov.au/askalibrarian/&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of New Zealand's Ask a Librarian service: http://www.natlib.govt.nz/services/get-advice/ask-a-librarian&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Canada's virtual reference services: http://vrl.tpl.toronto.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of Colorado in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Colorado, the service from the state of Colorado in the USA: {{cite web|url=http://www.askcolorado.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725045834/http://www.askcolorado.org/ |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chasing the Sun==

A collaboration between UK and Australian library services, entitled Chasing the Sun,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changechampions.com.au/resource/Sue_Rockliff.pdf PDF presentation by Chasing the Sun Co-chair Sue Rockliff]&lt;/ref&gt; has been initiated using [[QuestionPoint]] software so that an all-hours digital reference chat service can be offered.  Targeted at health libraries where reference queries from health professionals could occur at any time of the day or night due to medical emergencies, the collaboration between the two countries means that someone will be on hand to field the query at any time. Although the UK libraries involved are currently based in England the programme may expand to other countries and health services if successful.

[[File:Red Knot from The Crossley ID Guide Eastern Birds.jpg|thumb|A species plate from ''The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern Birds'', illustrating different plumages of the [[red knot]]]]
A '''field guide''' is a [[book]] designed to help the reader identify [[wildlife]] (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. [[mineral]]s). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/bix/fieldguides/index.html The International Field Guides Database]. Diane Schmidt. Accessed September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include [[identification key]]s to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 ''How to Know the Wildflowers'' by "Mrs. William Starr Dana" ([[Frances Theodora Parsons]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1890, [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]] published ''Birds Through an Opera-Glass'', describing 70 common species.  Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Mark V.|title=A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691044026|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist [[Vernon Orlando Bailey|Vernon Bailey]]), she published ''Handbook of Birds of the Western United States''.  By contrast, the ''Handbook'' is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by [[taxonomic order]] and had clear descriptions of [[species]] size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kofalk|first=Harriet|title=No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist|date=1989|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|location=College Station, TX|isbn=0-89096-378-9|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by [[Chester A. Reed]] and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Thomas R.|title=In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders &amp; Their Guides|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199734597|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Roger Tory Peterson]], using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the "[[Peterson Identification System]]", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from [[animal tracks]] to [[seashell]]s and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization.  Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the [[Audubon Society]],  the [[RSPB]], the [[Field Studies Council]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[HarperCollins]], and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of [[identification key]]s. Plant field guides such as ''Newcomb's Wildflower Guide'' (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Lawrence|title=Newcomb's Wildflower Guide|date=1977|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-60442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:

{{quote|A drawing can do much more than a photograph to emphasize the field marks. A photograph is a record of a fleeting instant; a drawing is a composite of the artist's experience. The artist can edit out, show field marks to best advantage, and delete unnecessary clutter. He can choose position and stress basic color and pattern unmodified by transitory light and shade. ... The artist has more options and far more control .... Whereas a photograph can have a living immediacy a good drawing is really more instructive.  (This passage was written not by Roger Tory Peterson, but by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of Peterson's field guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|title=A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern and Central North America|date=1989|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This passage was also quoted by Law and Lynch (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lists, Field Guides, and the Descriptive Organization of Seeing: Birdwatching as an Exemplary Observational Activity|author1=Law, John  |author2=Michael Lynch|journal= Human Studies|volume= 11|issue= 2/3|date=1988|pages=271–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pearson, D. L.  |author2=Shetterly, J. A. |date=2006|title=How do published field guides influence interactions between amateurs and professionals in entomology? |journal=American Entomologist |volume=52|issue=4|pages=246–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

'''''Handbook of Middle American Indians''''' ('''HMAI''') is a sixteen-volume compendium on [[Mesoamerica]] , from the [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] to the late twentieth century. Volumes on particular topics were published from the 1960s and 1970s under the general editorship of [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wauchope, general editor. ‘’Handbook of Middle American Indians’’, 16 volumes.  Austin: University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt; Separate volumes with particular volume editors  deal with  a number of general topics, including archeology, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, linguistics, with the last four substantive volumes treating various topics in Mesoamerican ethnohistory, under the editorship of [[Howard F. Cline]]. Select volumes have become available in e-book format.

A retrospective review of the HMAI by two anthropologists discusses its history and evaluates it.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Marcus and Ronald Spores, "The Handbook of Middle American Indians: A Retrospective Look." American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 80, No. 1 (Mar., 1978), pp. 85-100, Published by: Wiley on behalf of the American Anthropological Association, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/673513 accessed 24 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; One review calls it a fundamental work.&lt;ref&gt;Berthe, J.-P. “Un Ouvrage Fondamental: Le ‘Handbook of Middle American Indians.’” ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'', vol. 21, no. 1, 1966, pp. 229–230. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27576567 accessed 24 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer says "since the first volume of the HMAI appeared in 1964 is far and away the most comprehensive and erudite coverage of native cultures of any region in the Americas."&lt;ref&gt;Colston, Stephen A. “The Americas.” ''The Americas'', vol. 33, no. 4, 1977, pp. 679–680. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/980885. accessed 24 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; A review in the journal ''Science'' says that "There can be little doubt that, like the ''Handbook of South American Indians'', this monumental synthesis will provide a sound basis for new generalizations and will stimulate additional research to fill the gaps in knowledge and understanding that will become apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Woodbury. “Handbook of Middle American Indians.” ''Science'', vol. 148, no. 3671, 1965, pp. 798–800. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1716362. accessed 24 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1981, six volumes in the '''''Supplement to the Handbook of Middle American Indians''''' were published under the general editorship of [[Victoria Bricker]].&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Bricker, ‘’Supplement to the Handbook of Middle American Indians’’. 6 vols. Austin: University of Texas Press 1981-2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Volumes 6 &amp; 7 were reviewed when the appeared. One reviewer highlights several articles, including those by Eric R. Wolf, Angel Palerm, and Willilam Sanders, but he goes on to say "These volumes are ... more valuable for reference than for reading. Sections dealing with distribution, history, and bibliography are very useful, but sections dealing with social structure or the character of the peoples generally fail to provide integrated analyses indicating the essential features."&lt;ref&gt;Dessaint, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">A '''metabibliography''' (or '''biblio-bibliography''') is a [[bibliography]] of bibliographies.

Bibliographies serve the finding of relevant documents. Metabibliographies serve the finding of the relevant bibliographies in which the relevant documents may be found. One might quote Patrick Wilson:

"For if knowledge is power, power over knowledge is power to increase one's power; and if the stock of writings is thought of mainly as it represents a stock of knowledge, it is natural to propose treating it as a "resource" to be subjected to rational control, managemenet and utilization." (Wilson, 1968, p. 145).

Metabibliographies are valuable for building reference collections, but usually of less interest to the average user, who rely on bibliographies selected by others.

'''Microsoft Bookshelf''' was a [[Reference work|reference]] collection introduced in 1987 as part of [[Microsoft]]'s extensive work in promoting [[CD-ROM]] technology as a distribution medium for [[electronic publishing]].  The original [[MS-DOS]] version showcased the massive storage capacity of CD-ROM technology, and was accessed while the user was using one of 13 different word processor programs that Bookshelf supported.  Subsequent versions were produced for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and became a commercial success as part of the [[Microsoft Home]] brand.  It was often bundled with [[personal computer]]s as a cheaper alternative to the [[Microsoft Encarta|Encarta Suite]]. The Encarta Deluxe Suite / Reference Library versions also bundled Bookshelf.

==Content==
Microsoft Bookshelf was discontinued in 2000. In later editions of the Encarta suite (Encarta 2000 and onwards), Bookshelf was replaced with a dedicated ''Encarta Dictionary'', a superset of the printed edition. There has been some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in Bookshelf which many found to be a useful reference, such as the dictionary of quotations (replaced with a quotations section in ''Encarta'' that links to relevant articles and people) and the Internet Directory, although the directory is now a [[wikt:moot point|moot point]] since many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist.

The original 1987 edition contained ''[[Roget's Thesaurus|The Original Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases]]'', ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', [[World Almanac]] and Book of Facts, [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]], [[The Chicago Manual of Style]] (13th Edition), the U.S. ZIP Code Directory, Houghton Mifflin Usage Alert, [[Houghton Mifflin]] Spelling Verifier and Corrector, Business Information Sources, and Forms and Letters.&lt;ref name="Bookshelf 87"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computers for Lawyers|work=Chapter 25|first=Paul|last=Bernstein|publisher=ATLA Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-941916-64-2}}|year=1992|isbn=0-941916-64-2|accessdate=2006-04-18|url=http://www.cyberbarassociation.net/cfl/book/chpt25.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504152218/http://www.cyberbarassociation.net/cfl/book/chpt25.htm|archivedate=2006-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titles in non-US versions of Bookshelf were different. For example, the 1997 UK edition included the Chambers Dictionary, Bloomsbury Treasury of Quotations, and Hutchinson Concise Encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/software/722/bookshelf-british-reference-collection Bookshelf British Reference Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019005540/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/software/722/bookshelf-british-reference-collection |date=2009-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Windows release of Bookshelf added a number of new reference titles, including ''The Concise [[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' and an [[Web directory|Internet Directory]]. Other titles were added and some were dropped in subsequent years.  By 1994, the [[English language|English-language]] version also contained the ''[[Columbia Dictionary of Quotations]]''; ''The Concise [[Columbia Encyclopedia]]''; the ''[[Hammond Intermediate World Atlas]]''; and ''[[The People's Chronology]]''.&lt;ref name="Bookshelf 94"&gt;{{cite web

==Technology==

===Bookshelf 1.0 engine===
Bookshelf 1.0 used a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[hypertext]] engine that Microsoft acquired when it bought the company Cytation in 1986.&lt;ref name="Microsoft 1980s"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=A History of the Personal Computer: The People and the Technology 
 |work=Chapter 12 Microsoft in the 1980s
 |first=Roy|last=Allan|publisher=Allan Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|0-9689108-0-7}} |year=2001
 |isbn=0-9689108-0-7|accessdate=2006-04-18
 |url=http://www.retrocomputing.net/info/allan/eBook12.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also used for Microsoft Stat Pack and Microsoft Small Business Consultant, it was a [[Terminate and Stay Resident]] (TSR) program that ran alongside a dominant program, unbeknownst to the dominant program. Like Apple's similar [[Hypercard]] reader, Bookshelf engine's files used a single [[compound document]], containing large numbers of subdocuments ("cards" or "articles").  They both differ from current browsers which normally treat each "page" or "article" as a separate file.

Though similar to Apple's [[Hypercard]] reader in many ways, the Bookshelf engine had several key differences. Unlike Hypercard files, Bookshelf files required compilation and complex markup codes. This made the files more difficult to pirate, addressing a key concern of early electronic publishers. Furthermore, Bookshelf's engine was designed to run as fast as possible on slow first-generation [[CD-ROM]] drives, some of which required as much as a half-second to move the drive head. Such hardware constraints made Hypercard impractical for high-capacity CD-ROMs.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Bookshelf also had full text searching capability, which made it easy to find needed information.

===Bookshelf 2.0 engine===
Collaborating with [[DuPont]], the Microsoft CD-ROM division developed a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of its engine for applications as diverse as [[Document management system|document management]], [[online help]], and a CD-ROM [[encyclopedia]]. In a [[skunkworks project]], these developers worked secretly with Multimedia Division developers so that the engine would be usable for more ambitious multimedia applications. Thus they integrated a multimedia [[markup language]], [[full text search]], and extensibility using [[software componentry|software objects]],&lt;ref name="Viewer 2.0"&gt;{{cite book|
  title=Microsoft Multimedia Viewer How-To Cd: Create Exciting Multimedia With Video, Animation, Music, and Speech for Windows/Book and Cd|
  last=Pruitt|first=Stephen|publisher=Waite Group Pr|isbn=1-878739-60-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are commonplace in modern internet browsing.

In 1992, Microsoft started selling the Bookshelf engine to third-party developers, marketing the product as Microsoft Multimedia Viewer. The idea was that such a tool would help a burgeoning growth of CD-ROM titles that would spur demand for Windows. Although the engine had multimedia capabilities that would not be matched by Web browsers until the late 1990s, Microsoft Viewer did not enjoy commercial success as a standalone product. However, Microsoft continued to use the engine for its [[Encarta]] and [[WinHelp]] applications, though the multimedia functions are rarely used in Windows help files.

===Viewer 3.0===
In 1993, the developers who were working on the next generation viewer were moved to the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo systems group]] which was charged with delivering [[Bill Gates]]' 'vision' of 'Information at your fingertips'.  This advanced browser was a fully componentized application using what are now known as [[Component Object Model]] objects, designed for hypermedia browsing across large networks and whose main competitor was thought to be [[Lotus Notes]].  Long before Netscape appeared, this team, known as the WEB (web enhanced browser) team had already shipped a network capable hypertext browser capable of doing everything that HTML browsers would not be able to do until the turn of the century.  Nearly all technologies of Cairo shipped.  The WEB browser was not one of them, though it influenced the design of many other common Microsoft technologies.

==Reception==
''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' in 1989 listed Microsoft Bookshelf as among the "Excellence" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it "is the first substantial application of CD-ROM technology" and "a harbinger of personal library systems to come".&lt;ref name="byte198901"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=January 1989 |title=The BYTE Awards |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1989-01/1989_01_BYTE_14-01_PC_Communications_and_Annual_Awards_and_Digitizing_Tablets#page/n371/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Observer's Books''''' were a series of small, pocket-sized books, published by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] in the United Kingdom from 1937 to 2003. They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items.&lt;ref name=OPSCS&gt;{{cite web|title=About the books|url=http://www.observersbooksociety.co.uk/about_books.html|publisher=OPSCS|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogswell|first=Barry|title=To Have Borne Witness: Memories and Observations Regarding Human Population and Species Loss|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|year=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4969-0310-5|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds.  

The books were produced with paper [[dust jacket|dust covers]] up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as "Glossies". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.

The first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.

In 1942 a special edition book was brought out on "airplanes" {{sic}}. This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. 

The first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like ''Aircraft'', ''Automobiles'' and ''Railway Locomotives'' proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. 

When Warne was acquired by [[Penguin Books|Penguin books]] in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).

After a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled ''Observer's Book of Observer's Books'' in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of ''Wayside and Woodland'' in 2003.

{{Other uses|PSC (disambiguation)}}
'''psc''' is a post-nominal for ''passed Staff College'' in the Commonwealth militaries of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India|Indian]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Pakistan]]. It indicates that an officer has undertaken the [[staff officer]] course at a [[Staff College]].

==United Kingdom==
The practice originated in the [[British Army]] where the initials ''psc'' appeared in the service lists denoting that the officer had attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]]. [[Royal Navy]] offers who attended the staff course at [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]] also used the qualification. Since the 1997 amalgamation of staff training officers now receive the letters '''psc(j)''' from the [[Joint Services Command and Staff College]].

==Bangladesh==
'''PSC''' is used for Bangladeshi Army officers who have attended the Defence Services Command &amp; Staff College (DSCSC), Bangladesh.

==India==
Initials '''psc''' is used by officers who attended the [[Defence Services Staff College]], Wellington, India.

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan initials '''psc''' is used by officers who attended the [[Command and Staff College]], [[Quetta]].

==Malaysia==
Officers graduated from the Malaysian Armed Forces Staff College, Kuala Lumpur use the initials '''psc'''.

==Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, the initials '''psc''' are used by Army, Navy and Air Force officers who have gained the Pass Staff College status from a recognized a staff college such as the [[Defence Services Command and Staff College]] and the [[Sri Lanka Air Force Junior Command &amp; Staff College]]. Such officers are eligible to wear the psc badge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dscsc.lk/index.php/news/476-pinning-badges-dscsc9 Staff Qualified Officers Get 'psc' Badges]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recursion''' occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from [[linguistics]] to [[logic]]. The most common application of recursion is in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], where a [[function (mathematics)|function]] being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

==Formal definitions==
[[File:Serpiente alquimica.jpg|thumb|[[Ouroboros]], an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:
# {{anchor|base case}}A simple '''base case''' (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
# A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case

For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:
*One's [[parent]]s are one's [[ancestor]]s (''base case'').
*The ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (''recursion step'').

The [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a classic example of recursion:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(0)=0\text{ as base case 1,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(1)=1\text{ as base case 2,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{For all integers }n&gt;1,~\text{ Fib}(n):=\text{Fib}(n-1) + \text{Fib}(n-2).&lt;/math&gt;

Many mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the [[natural number]]s by the [[Peano axioms]] can be described as: ''0 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.'' By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.

Recursively defined mathematical objects include [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and especially [[fractal]]s.

There are various more tongue-in-cheek "definitions" of recursion; see [[#Recursive humor|recursive humor]].

==Informal definition==
[[File:Sourdough.jpg|thumb|Recently refreshed [[sourdough]], bubbling through [[fermentation]]: the [[recipe]] calls for some sourdough left over from the last time the same recipe was made.]]

Recursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves  invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.

To understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules. The running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps.  An analogy: a procedure is like a written recipe; running a procedure is like actually preparing the meal.

Recursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure. For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a [[sourdough]] recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you've never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations. An example could be the following procedure to find a way through a [[maze]]. Proceed forward until reaching either an exit or a branching point (a dead end is considered a branching point with 0 branches). If the point reached is an exit, terminate. Otherwise try each branch in turn, using the procedure recursively; if every trial fails by reaching only dead ends, return on the path that led to this branching point and report failure. Whether this actually defines a terminating procedure depends on the nature of the maze: it must not allow loops. In any case, executing the procedure requires carefully recording all currently explored branching points, and which of their branches have already been exhaustively tried.

==In language==
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] among many others has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Language Instinct|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2004.08.004 | title = The faculty of language: What's so special about it? | year = 2005 | last1 = Pinker | first1=Steven | last2 = Jackendoff | first2=Ray | journal = Cognition | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–236 | pmid=15694646| citeseerx = 10.1.1.116.7784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: ''Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous'', in which the sentence ''witches are dangerous'' occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.

This provides a way of understanding the creativity of language—the unbounded number of grammatical sentences—because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: ''Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that...''. There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.

Recently, however, the generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by [[Daniel Everett]] on the basis of his claims about the [[Pirahã language]]. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/lan.0.0140 |title=Evidence and argumentation: A reply to Everett (2009) |url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |year=2009 |last1=Nevins |first1=Andrew |last2=Pesetsky |first2=David |last3=Rodrigues |first3=Cilene |journal=Language |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=671–681 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106154616/http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary [[self-reference]] can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker|first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in [[natural language semantics]]. The word ''and'', for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, ''and'' is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Partee and Mats Rooth. 1983. In Rainer Bäuerle et al., ''Meaning, Use, and Interpretation of Language''. Reprinted in Paul Portner and Barbara Partee, eds. 2002. ''Formal Semantics: The Essential Readings''. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[recursive grammar]] is a formal grammar that contains recursive [[production (computer science)|production rules]].&lt;ref name="ns02"&gt;{{citation

===Recursive humor===
Recursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a [[circular definition]] or [[self-reference]], in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an [[infinite regress]]. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their [[glossary]] along the lines of:
:Recursion, ''see Recursion''.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=David|title=Essentials of Discrete Mathematics|year=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|pages=494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuwhTxCVovQC&amp;dq=recursion+joke&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation is found on page 269 in the [[Back-of-the-book index|index]]  of some editions of [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]]'s book ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]''; the index entry recursively references itself ("recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269"). The earliest version of this joke was in "Software Tools" by Kernighan and Plauger, and also appears in "The UNIX Programming Environment" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of ''The C Programming Language''.

Another joke is that "To understand recursion, you must understand recursion."&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; In the English-language version of the [[Google]] web search engine, when a search for "recursion" is made, the site suggests "Did you mean: ''recursion''." An alternative form is the following, from [[Andrew Plotkin]]: ''"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to [[Douglas Hofstadter]] than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is."''

[[Recursive acronym]]s can also be examples of recursive humor. [[PHP]], for example, stands for "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor", [[Wine (software)|WINE]] stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator." and [[GNU]] stands for "GNU's not Unix".

==In mathematics==
[[File:Sierpinski triangle.svg|thumb|250px|The [[Sierpinski triangle]]—a confined recursion of triangles that form a [[fractal]]]]

===Recursively defined sets===
{{Main|Recursive definition}}

====Example: the natural numbers====
{{see also|Closure (mathematics)}}
The canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the [[natural numbers]]:

:0 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:if ''n'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''n'' + 1 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:The set of natural numbers is the smallest set satisfying the previous two properties.

====Example: The set of true reachable propositions====
Another interesting example is the set of all "true reachable" propositions in an [[axiomatic system]].

*If a proposition is an axiom, it is a true reachable proposition.
*If a proposition can be obtained from true reachable propositions by means of inference rules, it is a true reachable proposition.
*The set of true reachable propositions is the smallest set of propositions satisfying these conditions.

This set is called 'true reachable propositions' because in non-constructive approaches to the foundations of mathematics, the set of true propositions may be larger than the set recursively constructed from the axioms and rules of inference. See also [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

===Finite subdivision rules===
{{Main|Finite subdivision rule}}
Finite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create [[fractal]]-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the [[Cantor set]] is a subdivision rule, as is [[barycentric subdivision]].

===Functional recursion===
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] may be partly defined in terms of itself.  A familiar example is the [[Fibonacci number]] sequence: ''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n'' − 1) + ''F''(''n'' − 2).  For such a definition to be useful, it must lead to non-recursively defined values, in this case ''F''(0) = 0 and ''F''(1) = 1.

A famous recursive function is the [[Ackermann function]], which—unlike the Fibonacci sequence—cannot easily be expressed without recursion.

===Proofs involving recursive definitions===
Applying the standard technique of [[proof by cases]] to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields [[structural induction]], a powerful generalization of [[mathematical induction]] widely used to derive proofs in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]].

===Recursive optimization===
[[Dynamic programming]] is an approach to [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the [[Bellman equation]], which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).

===The recursion theorem===
In [[set theory]], this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist.  Given a set ''X'', an element ''a'' of ''X'' and a function &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem states that there is a unique function &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that
:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
for any natural number ''n''.

====Proof of uniqueness====
Take two functions &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;G: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  such that:

:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(n + 1) = f(G(n))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is an element of ''X''.

It can be proved by [[mathematical induction]] that &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all natural numbers ''n'':

:'''Base Case''': &lt;math&gt;F(0) = a = G(0)&lt;/math&gt; so the equality holds for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Inductive Step''': Suppose &lt;math&gt;F(k) = G(k)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(k+1) = f(F(k)) = f(G(k)) = G(k+1).&lt;/math&gt;
::Hence F(k) = G(k) implies F(k+1) = G(k+1).

By induction, &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

==In computer science==
{{Main|Recursion (computer science)}}
A common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a [[computer programming]] technique, this is called [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is [[dynamic programming]]. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.

A classic example of recursion is the definition of the [[factorial]] function, given here in [[C (programming language)|C]] code:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

If not having reached the [[base case (recursion)|base case]] and returning with value {{math|1,}} every [[Instance (computer science)|instantiation]] of the above function creates a new instance of the function, passing to it an input reduced by {{math|1}} ({{code|(n - 1)}}), and returns the result of this (recursive) call, multiplied by its own value of {{code|n}}, analogously to the mathematical definition of the factorial.

Recursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in [[parser]]s for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.

[[Recurrence relation]]s are equations to define one or more sequences  recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be "solved" to obtain a non-recursive definition.

Use of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages.  The main advantage is usually simplicity.  The main disadvantage is often that the algorithm may require large amounts of memory if the depth of the recursion is very large.

A '''reference scenario''' is an imagined situation where a [[library]] patron brings a question to a [[librarian]] and there is then a conversation, called in the field a [[reference interview]], where the librarian works to help the patron find what he or she wants.  These scenarios are used in training future librarians how to help patrons.  Basically, a scenario is as short as a couple of sentences, including a question and a situation that underlies that question.

A great deal of reference teaching puts students to researching the answers to made-up questions.  This focuses the student on learning about the reference sources at hand by using them to answer those questions.  Scenarios are something different.  They focus the student on the interaction with patrons.  In class practice sessions, one student can be the patron and the other the librarian, as long as the one practicing as the librarian doesn't know the whole scenario in advance.

Scenarios are valued because often the question asked is not the end of the patron's information hunt, but the start.  Patrons often start by voicing a question that they think the library can answer, rather than the question they are really seeking to answer.  Or they pose a question that the librarian doesn't understand.  Reference librarian skills are very much about mediating a gap between what the patron wants and what the library can provide.  This can involve the librarian making him or herself a partner in the patron's search, teaching them what the library really has to offer, or even just clarifying a confusing word: Does the patron want information about soaps to clean with or soaps as in soap operas?

[[File:HasekuraBookItalian.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Scipione Amati]]'s ''[[History of the Kingdom of Voxu]]'' (1615)  an example of a secondary source.]]
In [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], a '''secondary source'''&lt;ref name=UMD&gt;"[http://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=327327&amp;p=2195975 Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/secondary Secondary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[document]] or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a [[primary source]], which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. 

A secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format.  Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis,  interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. 
 
The most accurate [[#Classification|classification]] for any given source is not always obvious.  ''Primary'' and ''secondary'' are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121|quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

==Classification==
Information can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called '''symbolic sources'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OX7d7u_2rF4C&amp;pg=PA121|title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science|last=Kragh|first=Helge|date=1989-11-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521389211|location=|pages=121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a [[midden]], regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kragh|1989|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalton|Charnigo|2004|p=419 n.18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Delgadillo|Lynch|1999|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an [[obituary]]&lt;ref name="Duffin"&gt;{{Citation|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name="Duffin" /&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Henige|first=David|authorlink=David Henige|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Duke University Press|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further "levels". One such model is the [[UNISIST model]] of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.

Some other [[modern language]]s use more than one word for the English word "source". [[German language|German]] usually uses ''Sekundärliteratur'' ("secondary literature") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving ''Sekundärquelle'' ("secondary source") to [[historiography]]. A ''Sekundärquelle'' is a source which can tell about a lost ''Primärquelle'' ("primary source"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.

==Science, technology, and medicine==
In general, secondary sources are self-described as [[Review journal|review article]]s or [[meta-analysis]].

Primary source materials are typically defined as "original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study." An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in [[IMRAD]] style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrard, Judith |title=Health Sciences Literature Review Made Easy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSbfIcjQUcsC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2012|date= 2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-1868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010/&gt; A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.

A [[book review]] that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.

===Library and information science===

In [[library and information science]]s, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to [[primary sources]] in the context of the particular information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=UMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2/&gt;

=== Maths ===

An important use of secondary sources in the field of [[mathematics]] has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Edwards|first=H.M.|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician)|title=Riemann's Zeta Function|year=2001|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|publication-place=Mineola, New York|isbn=0-486-41740-9|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5uLAoued_dIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22|quote=The purpose of a secondary source is to make the primary sources accessible to you. If you can read and understand the primary sources without reading this book, more power to you. If you read this book without reading the primary sources you are like a man who carries a sack lunch to a banquet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other sciences [[tertiary source]]s are expected to fulfill the introductory role.

===Humanities and history===
Secondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or [[academic journal|scholarly journals]], from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a [[peer review]]ed article is always a secondary source.
The delineation of sources as [[primary sources|primary]] and secondary first arose in the field of [[historiography]], as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing.  In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Helge (1989), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In  original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cipolla|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|title=Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History|year=1992|isbn=978-0-393-30816-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cipolla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Leopold von Ranke|Rankean model]] established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use [[archive]]s of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick C. Beiser|title=The German Historicist Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ1k6w0dFIMC&amp;pg=PA254|year=2011|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Camic|author2=Neil Gross|author3=Michele Lamont|title=Social Knowledge in the Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l7iDZY-MSoC&amp;pg=PA107|year=2011|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law====
In the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the [[headnote]]s of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bouchoux|first=Deborah E.|year=2000|title=Cite Checker: A Hands-On Guide to Learning Citation Form|page=45|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1893-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22+%22science+citation%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and [[precedent]]ial, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bouchoux|2000|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family history====
"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor."&lt;ref&gt;Harland, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event "when the fallibility of memory is an important factor" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.

====Autobiographies====
An autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in [[World War I]] written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, particularly the introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Note to anyone who is thinking of making this article self referential: Please do not do this, see the note at top of the recursion article for why --&gt;{{Selfref|For the self-reference template on Wikipedia, see [[Template:Selfref]].}}

[[Image:ouroboros.png|thumb|The [[Ouroboros]], a dragon that continually consumes itself, is used as a symbol for self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soto-Andrade |first1=Jorge |last2=Jaramillo |first2=Sebastian |last3=Gutierrez |first3=Claudio |last4=Letelier |first4=Juan-Carlos |title=Ouroboros avatars: A mathematical exploration of Self-reference and Metabolic Closure |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/alife/0262297140chap115.pdf |publisher=MIT Press |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Self-reference''' occurs in [[natural language|natural]] or [[formal language|formal languages]] when a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], idea or [[formula]] refers to itself. The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some [[Semantics encoding|encoding]]. In [[philosophy]], it also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself: to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun, [[I (pronoun)|the word "I"]] in English.

Self-reference is studied and has applications in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[computer programming]], and [[linguistics]]. Self-referential statements are sometimes [[paradox]]ical, and can also be considered [[Recursion|recursive]].

==In logic, mathematics and computing ==
In classical [[philosophy]], [[paradoxes]] were created by self-referential concepts such as the [[omnipotence paradox]] of asking if it was possible for a being to exist so powerful that it could create a stone that it could not lift. The [[Epimenides paradox]], 'All Cretans are liars' when uttered by an ancient Greek Cretan was one of the first recorded versions. Contemporary philosophy sometimes employs the same technique to demonstrate that a supposed concept is meaningless or ill-defined.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[computability theory]], self-reference (also known as [[Impredicativity]]) is the key concept in proving limitations of many systems. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] uses it to show that no formal consistent system of mathematics can ever contain all possible mathematical truths, because it cannot prove some truths about its own structure. [[The halting problem]] equivalent, in computation theory, shows that there is always some task that a computer cannot perform, namely reasoning about itself. These proofs relate to a long tradition of mathematical paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Berry's paradox]], and ultimately to classical philosophical paradoxes.

In [[game theory]] undefined behaviors can occur where two players must model each other's mental states and behaviors, leading to infinite regress.

In [[computer programming]], self-reference occurs in [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]], where a program can read or modify its own instructions like any other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malenfant|first1=J.|last2=Demers|first2=F-N|title=A Tutorial on Behavioral Reflection and its Implementation|url=http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/projects/reflection96/docs/malenfant/malenfant.pdf|publisher=PARC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous programming languages support reflection to some extent with varying degrees of expressiveness. Additionally, self-reference is seen in [[recursion]] (related to the mathematical [[recurrence relation]]) in [[functional programming]], where a code structure refers back to itself during computation.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker |first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Taming' self-reference from potentially paradoxical concepts into well-behaved recursions has been one of the great successes of [[computer science]], and is now used routinely in, for example, writing [[compilers]] using the 'meta-language' [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Using a compiler to compile itself is known as [[bootstrapping]]. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible to write (programs which operate on themselves), both with [[Assembly language|assembler]] and with functional languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], but is generally discouraged in real-world programming. Computing hardware makes fundamental use of self-reference in [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], the basic units of digital memory, which convert potentially paradoxical logical self-relations into memory by expanding their terms over time. Thinking in terms of self-reference is a pervasive part of programmer culture, with many programs and acronyms named self-referentially as a form of humor, such as [[GNU]] ('Gnu's not Unix') and [[PINE]] ('Pine is not Elm'). The [[GNU Hurd]] is named for a pair of mutually self-referential acronyms.

[[Tupper's self-referential formula]] is a mathematical curiosity which plots an image of its own formula.

== In life ==
The biology of [[self-replication]] is self-referential, as embodied by [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] replication mechanisms. Models of self-replication are found in the computational [[Game of life]], and have inspired engineering systems such as the [[RepRap]] self-replicating 3d printer.

== In art ==
Self-reference occurs in [[literature]] and [[film]] when an author refers to his or her own work in the context of the work itself. Examples include [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'', [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[If on a winter's night a traveler]]'', many stories by [[Nikolai Gogol]], ''[[Lost in the Funhouse]]'' by [[John Barth]], [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' and [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]''. Perhaps the earliest example is in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]], where [[Helen of Troy]] laments: "for generations still unborn/we will live in song" (appearing in the song itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |others=Translated by Robert Fagles |title=Iliad |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=1-101-15281-8 |page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reference in art is closely related to the concepts of [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and [[meta-reference]], which often involve self-reference. The short stories of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] play with self-reference and related paradoxes in many ways. [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Krapp's Last Tape]] consists entirely of the protagonist listening to and making recordings of himself, mostly about other recordings. During the 1990s and 2000s filmic self-reference was a popular part of the [[rubber reality]] movement, notably in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s films [[Being John Malkovich]] and [[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]], the latter pushing the concept arguably to its breaking point as it attempts to portray its own creation.

Various [[creation myths]] invoke self-reference to solve the problem of what created the creator. For example the [[Egyptian creation myth]] has a god swallowing his own semen to create himself. [[Ouroboros]] is a mythical dragon which eats itself.

The [[surrealist]] painter [[René Magritte]] is famous for his self-referential works. His painting ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'', includes the words "this is not a pipe", the truth of which depends entirely on whether the word ''ceci'' (in English, "this") refers to the pipe depicted&amp;mdash;or to the painting or the word or sentence itself.&lt;ref name="NöthBishara2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nöth |first1=Winfried |last2=Bishara |first2=Nina |title=Self-reference in the Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBOFIdchEQYC&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2007 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019464-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M.C. Escher]]'s art also contains many self-referential concepts such as hands drawing themselves.

== In language ==
A word that describes itself is called an ''[[autological word]]'' (or ''[[autological word|autonym]]''). This generally applies to adjectives, for example [[wikt:sesquipedalian|sesquipedalian]] (i.e. "sesquipedalian" is a sesquipedalian word), but can also apply to other parts of speech, such as [[wikt:TLA|TLA]], as a three-letter [[abbreviation]] for "[[three-letter abbreviation]]".

A sentence which inventories its own letters and punctuation marks is called an [[autogram]].

There is a special case of meta-sentence in which the content of the sentence in the metalanguage and the content of the sentence in the object language are the same. Such a sentence is referring to itself. However some meta-sentences of this type can lead to paradoxes. "This is a sentence." can be considered to be a self-referential meta-sentence which is obviously true. However "This sentence is false" is a meta-sentence which leads to a self-referential [[Liar paradox|paradox]]. Such sentences can lead to problems, for example, in law, where statements bringing laws into existence can contradict one another or themselves. [[Kurt Gödel]] claimed to have found such a paradox in the [[US constitution]] at his citizenship ceremony.

Self-reference occasionally occurs in the [[Broadcast media|media]] when it is required to write about itself, for example the [[BBC]] reporting on job cuts at the BBC. Notable encyclopedias may be required to feature articles about themselves, such as [[Wikipedia]]'s article on Wikipedia.

[[Fumblerules]] are a list of rules of good grammar and writing, demonstrated through sentences that violate those very rules, such as "Avoid cliches like the plague" and "Don't use no double negatives". The term was coined in a published list of such rules by [[William Safire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-usage-english.org/humorousrules.html alt.usage.english.org's ''Humorous Rules for Writing'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = William |last= Safire |authorlink=William Safire |publication-date=1979-11-04 |title=On Language; The Fumblerules of Grammar |periodical=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/on-language-the-fumblerules-of-grammar.html?sq=Fumblerules&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p |page=SM4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In meta-disciplines ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Several academic disciplines are sometime required to study themselves in forms of self-reference, for example [[historiography]] (or "[[meta-history]]") is history's study of its own past; [[meta-sociology]] occurs when sociologists study the power structures in their own academic institutions; and [[meta-mathematics]] is the study of mathematics itself as a formal system, using its own methods. In [[law]], self-reference may become an issue when laws are required to regulate the making of new laws, especially around [[constitutional]] issues. (The game of [[nomic]] begins as a model of this process.) The prefix "[[meta]]" is often used to denote this type of self-reference.

==In popular culture==
* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s books, especially ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' and ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', play with many self-referential concepts and were highly influential in bringing them into mainstream intellectual culture during the 1980s. [[Hofstadter's law]], which specifies that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law"&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]]. ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''. 20th anniversary ed., 1999, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a self-referencing adage. Hofstadter also suggested the concept of a 'Reviews of this book', a book containing only reviews of itself, which has since been implemented using [[wiki|wikis]] and other technologies. Hofstadter's '[[strange loop]]' [[metaphysics]] attempts to map [[consciousness]] onto self-reference, but is a minority position in [[philosophy of mind]].
* The subgenre of "[[recursion|recursive]] [[science fiction]]" or [[metafiction]] is now so extensive that it has fostered a fan-maintained bibliography at the [[New England Science Fiction Association]]'s website; some of it is about [[science-fiction fandom]], some about science fiction and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesfa.org/Recursion/index.htm "Recursive Science Fiction"] New England Science Fiction Association website, last updated 3 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2823">'''Species affinis''' (commonly abbreviated to: '''sp. aff.''',  '''aff.''', or '''affin.''') is [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] terminology in [[zoology]] and [[botany]]. In [[open nomenclature]] it indicates that available material or evidence suggests that the proposed [[species]] is ''related to'', has an ''[[Affinity (taxonomy)|affinity]]'' to, but is ''not identical to'', the species with the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | publisher  = cactus-art.biz
 | accessdate = 2010-12-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''affinis'' can be translated as ''closely related to'', or ''akin to''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Oxford Latin Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=79 |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author who inserts ''[[n.sp.]],'' or ''[[sp. nov.]], aff'' before a species name thereby states the opinion that the specimen is a new, previously [[Species description|undescribed]] species,&lt;ref name="Bengtson 1988"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bengtson|first=P.|title=Open Nomenclature|url=http://www.palass-pubs.org/palaeontology/pdf/Vol31/Pages%20223-227.pdf|work=Palentology|accessdate=2 April 2014|year=1988|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071437/http://www.palass-pubs.org/palaeontology/pdf/Vol31/Pages%20223-227.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that there may not (yet) be enough information to complete a formal description. To use aff. alone, implies that the specimen differs suggestively from the [[holotype]] but that further progress is necessary to confirm that it is a novel species.

An example would be: a [[gastropod shell]] listed as [[Lucapina aff. aegis|''Lucapina'' aff. ''aegis'']] would mean that this shell somewhat resembles the shell of ''[[Lucapina aegis]]'', but is thought more likely to be another species, either closely related to, or closely resembling ''Lucapina aegis''. In a suitable context it also may suggest the possibility that the shell belongs to a species that has not yet been [[Species description|described]].

The use of aff. is similar to other indicators of open nomenclature such as [[cf.]], [[Species|sp.]], or ?,&lt;ref name="Bengtson 1988"/&gt; but the latter indicate that the species is ''uncertain'' rather than undescribed.

:''The Map Library should not be confused with the [[Map Library]] of [[The British Museum]].''

'''''The Map Library''''' is a project of '''The Map Maker Trust''' [[Charitable organization|charity]], and supported by '''Map Maker Ltd.''', for the supplying of free [[GIS]] data. The project website also hosts free conversion software for [[raster graphics|raster]] and [[vector graphics|vector]] files. As of November 2008, the only data sets available were for the continents of [[Africa]] and [[Central America]].

== Statement of purpose ==
From the website...

:''The idea behind the Map Library is that the lack of good, simple maps is a serious obstacle to development in all kinds of fields, from health care to urban management, from de-mining to environmental protection. The library's purpose is two fold: to make public domain mapping data more readily available for developing countries, and to provide free, easy to use software to facilitate map making by non-experts. The Map Library delivers data and software both on the internet and by post on CD for those with poor or no internet access.''

== Data format and conversion ==
The project data is managed in part by two pieces of software, each supporting different file formats and conversions.

* '''''Raster Converter''''' handles [[ECW (file format)|ECW]] files: these can be converted to [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[TIFF]], and with external libraries, [[JPEG]], and [[JPEG 2000]].
* '''''Vector Converter''''' handles MLB ("map-library") files: these files can be converted to data files for [[ArcView]], [[AutoCAD]], and several other formats.

== Data sources ==
The project uses data from [[NASA]] mapping projects, [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]], and the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]].

[[File:Historical Thesaurus.jpg|thumb|''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary'', two-volume set]]
In general usage, a '''thesaurus''' is a [[reference work]] that lists words grouped together according to similarity of meaning (containing [[synonyms]] and sometimes [[antonyms]]), in contrast to a [[dictionary]], which provides [[definitions]] for words, and generally lists them in alphabetical order. The main purpose of such reference works for users "to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed"&amp;nbsp;– to quote [[Peter Mark Roget]], architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.&lt;ref name="Roget"&gt;Roget, Peter. 1852. ''Thesaurus of English Language Words and Phrases''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a [[dictionary]], a thesaurus entry does not give the definition of words.

In [[library science]] and [[information science]], thesauri have been widely used to specify domain models.  Recently, thesauri have been implemented with [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] (SKOS).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Etymology ==
The word "thesaurus" is derived from 16th-century [[New Latin]], in turn from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:thesaurus#Latin|thēsaurus]]'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisation]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:en:θησαυρός#Ancient Greek|θησαυρός]]}} (''thēsauros''), "treasure, treasury, storehouse".&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=thesaurus "thesaurus"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''thēsauros'' is of uncertain etymology. [[Douglas Harper]] derives it from the root of the Greek verb τιθέναι ''tithenai'', "to put, to place."&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|Robert Beekes]] rejected an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] derivation and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] suffix {{nowrap|''*-ar&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;o-''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, the term "thesaurus" was applied to any [[dictionary]] or [[encyclopedia]], as in the ''[[Thesaurus linguae latinae]]'' (1532), and the ''[[Thesaurus linguae graecae]]'' (1572). The meaning "collection of words arranged according to sense" is first attested in 1852 in Roget's title and ''thesaurer'' is attested in [[Middle English]] for "[[treasurer]]".&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Roget P M.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Peter Mark Roget]], author of the first thesaurus.]]
In antiquity, [[Philo of Byblos]] authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In [[Sanskrit]], the [[Amarakosha]] is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. Eventhough Amarakosha mentions 18 prior works, they have all been lost.

The first modern thesaurus was ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', first compiled in 1805 by [[Peter Mark Roget]], and published in 1852. Since its publication it has never been out of print and is still a widely used work across the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729-chapter-1|title=Introduction - Oxford Scholarship|author=|date=|website=oxfordscholarship.com|accessdate=26 March 2018|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729-chapter-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entries in ''Roget's Thesaurus'' are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically.
Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1982, p. xix{{Full citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thesauri have been used to perform automatic [[word-sense disambiguation]]&lt;ref&gt;Yarowsky, David.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11159">A '''three-letter acronym''' ('''TLA'''), or '''three-letter abbreviation''', is an [[abbreviation]], specifically an [[Acronym|acronym, alphabetism, or initialism]], consisting of three letters. These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as ''etc.'' and ''Mrs.'' are not three-letter acronyms, but "TLA" {{em|itself}} is a TLA (an example of an [[Autological word|autological]] abbreviation).

Most three-letter abbreviations are ''initialisms'': all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in ''[[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|p|iː|ˈ|eɪ}} {{respell|AY|pee|AY|'}}. Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; [[computed axial tomography]], CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in "CAT scan".

==History and origins==

The exact phrase ''three-letter acronym'' appeared in the sociology literature in 1975.&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.

"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA  ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html On the cruelty of really teaching computer science]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992 it was in a [[Microsoft]] handbook.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Gookin (1992) ''The Microsoft Guide to Optimizing Windows'' page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinatorics==

The number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or [[permutations]]) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336.

In [[English language|English]], [[WWW (disambiguation)|WWW]] is the longest possible TLA to [[Pronunciation of "www"|pronounce]], typically requiring nine [[syllable]]s. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the [[acronym]] instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, "www" is sometimes abbreviated as "dubdubdub" in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.brynmawr.edu/features/digispeak-a-glossary-of-the-new-lingo/|title=DigiSpeak: A Glossary of the New Lingo|date=May 2011|website=bryn mawr alumnae bulletin|publisher=Bryn Mawr College Alumnae Association|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5949">'''Tupper's self-referential formula''' is a [[formula]] that visually represents itself when graphed at a specific location in the (''x'', ''y'') plane.

== History ==

The formula was defined by Jeff Tupper and appears as an example in Tupper's 2001 [[SIGGRAPH]] paper on reliable two-dimensional computer graphing algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/mooncake/papers/SIGGRAPH2001_Tupper.pdf Tupper, Jeff. "Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables"]&lt;/ref&gt; This paper discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-graphing program developed by Tupper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peda.com/grafeq/|title=Pedagoguery Software: GrafEq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the formula is called "[[self-reference|self-referential]]", Tupper did not name it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan |first1=Arvind |title=Tupper’s Self-Referential Formula Debunked |url=http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |accessdate=20 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424181239/http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |archivedate=24 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula ==

The formula is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;{1\over 2} &lt; \left\lfloor \mathrm{mod}\left(\left\lfloor {y \over 17} \right\rfloor 2^{-17 \lfloor x \rfloor - \mathrm{mod}(\lfloor y\rfloor, 17)},2\right)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
or, as plaintext,
{{quotation|1/2 &lt; floor(mod(floor(y/17)*2^(-17*floor(x)-mod(floor(y), 17)),2))}}

where ⌊&amp;nbsp;⌋ denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]], and mod is the [[modulo operation]].

Let ''k'' equal the following 543-digit integer:

{{quotation|960 939 379 918 958 884 971 672 962 127 852 754 715 004 339 660 129 306 651 505 519 271 702 802 395 266 424 689 642 842 174 350 718 121 267 153 782 770 623 355 993 237 280 874 144 307 891 325 963 941 337 723 487 857 735 749 823 926 629 715 517 173 716 995 165 232 890 538 221 612 403 238 855 866 184 013 235 585 136 048 828 693 337 902 491 454 229 288 667 081 096 184 496 091 705 183 454 067 827 731 551 705 405 381 627 380 967 602 565 625 016 981 482 083 418 783 163 849 115 590 225 610 003 652 351 370 343 874 461 848 378 737 238 198 224 849 863 465 033 159 410 054 974 700 593 138 339 226 497 249 461 751 545 728 366 702 369 745 461 014 655 997 933 798 537 483 143 786 841 806 593 422 227 898 388 722 980 000 748 404 719}}

If one [[Graph of a function|graphs]] the set of points (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') in 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;106 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;17 satisfying the inequality given above, the resulting graph looks like this (the axes in this plot have been reversed, otherwise the picture would be upside-down and mirrored):

[[File:Tupper's self referential formula plot.svg]]
[[File:Tupper_formula_constant_derivation.svg|thumb|91px&lt;!-- 91px gives acceptable text rendering with least overshoot or ugly gaps --&gt;|Derivation of ''k'']]

The formula is a general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant&amp;nbsp;''k'', and it could actually be used to draw any other image.  When applied to the unbounded positive range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'', the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane with a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps.  One horizontal slice of that infinite bitmap depicts the drawing formula itself, but this is not remarkable, since other slices depict all other possible formulae that might fit in a 17-pixel-tall bitmap. Tupper has created extended versions of his original formula that rule out all but one slice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot3big.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot2.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot.png&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant ''k'' is a simple [[1-bit color|monochrome]] [[bitmap|bitmap image]] of the formula treated as a binary number and multiplied by 17.  If ''k'' is divided by 17, the [[least significant bit]] encodes the upper-right corner (''k'',&amp;nbsp;0); the 17 least significant bits encode the rightmost column of pixels; the next 17 least significant bits encode the 2nd-rightmost column, and so on.

In [[set theory]], a '''universal set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] which contains all objects, including itself.&lt;ref&gt;Forster 1995 p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[set theory]] as usually formulated, the conception of a universal set leads to a [[paradox]] ([[Russell's paradox]]) and is consequently not allowed. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.

== Notation ==
There is no standard notation for the universal set of a given set theory. Common symbols include '''V''', '''U''' and '''[[xi (letter)|ξ]]'''.

==Reasons for nonexistence==
[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the [[cumulative hierarchy]], do not allow for the existence of a universal set. It is directly contradicted by the [[axiom of regularity]], and its existence would cause paradoxes which would make the theory inconsistent.

===Russell's paradox===
{{Main|Russell's paradox}}
Russell's paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and other set theories that include [[Zermelo]]'s [[axiom of comprehension]].
This axiom states that, for any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and any set {{mvar|A}}, there exists another set 
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in A \mid \varphi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
that contains exactly those elements {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|A}} that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.  If a universal set&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} existed and the axiom of comprehension could be applied to it, then
there would also exist another set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in V\mid x\not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. However, as [[Bertrand Russell]] observed, this set is paradoxical. If it contains itself, then it should not contain itself, and vice versa. For this reason, it cannot exist.

===Cantor's theorem===
{{Main|Cantor's theorem}}
A second difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the [[power set]] of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist.  However, this conflicts with Cantor's theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself.

==Theories of universality==
The difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.

===Restricted comprehension===
There are set theories known to be [[consistent]] (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set {{mvar|V}} does exist (and &lt;math&gt;V \in V&lt;/math&gt; is true). In these theories, Zermelo's [[axiom of comprehension]] does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of [[naive set theory]] is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a [[non-well-founded set theory]].
The most widely studied set theory with a universal set is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s [[New Foundations]]. [[Alonzo Church]] and [[:de:Arnold Oberschelp|Arnold Oberschelp]] also published work on such set theories.  Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine's,&lt;ref&gt;Church 1974 p. 308. See also Forster 1995 p. 136 or 2001 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flash Sheridan |date=2016 |title=A Variant of Church’s Set Theory with a Universal Set in which the Singleton Function is a Set |url=http://www.logic-center.be/Publications/Bibliotheque/SheridanVariantChurch.pdf |journal=Logique et Analyse |volume=59 |issue=233 |at=§0.2 |doi=10.2143/LEA.233.0.3149532|lay-url=http://www-logic.stanford.edu/seminar/1314/Sheridan_Fixing_Freges_Set_Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not possible for Oberschelp's, since in it the singleton function is provably a set,&lt;ref&gt;Oberschelp 1973 p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; which leads immediately to paradox in New Foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1998 p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent advances in this area have been made by [[Randall Holmes]] who published an online draft version of the book ''[[Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/ |title=Overview of Randall Holmes's Home Page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is [[positive set theory]], where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the [[positive formula]]s (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.

===Universal objects that are not sets===
{{main|Universe (mathematics)}}
The idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see [[universal quantifier]]).  One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe {{mvar|V}} and similar large collections as [[Class (set theory)|proper classes]] rather than as sets. One difference between a universal set and a [[universal class (set theory)|universal class]] is that the universal class does not contain itself, because [[proper class]]es cannot be elements of other classes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Russell's paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.

The [[category of sets]] can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. 
Again, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''viz.''}}
{{Wiktionary|viz.|videlicet}}
The abbreviation '''''viz.''''' (or '''''viz''''' without a full stop), short for the Latin {{lang|la|'''videlicet'''|italic=yes|links=no}}, which itself is a contraction from Latin of '''''videre licet''''' meaning "it is permitted to see", is used as a synonym for "namely", "that is to say", "to wit", or "as follows". It is typically used to introduce examples or further details to illustrate a point. For example: "all types of data viz. text, audio, video, pictures, graphics etc. can be transmitted through networking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='videlicet', Random House Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/videlicet?s=t|website=dictionary.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Viz.'' is [[shorthand]] for the adverb ''{{lang|la|videlicet}}''. It uses [[Tironian notes]], a system of Latin shorthand developed {{circa|63 BCE}}. It comprises the first two letters, "vi", followed by the last two, "et", using the z-shaped [[⁊#Current|Tironian "et"]], historically written ⁊,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |last=Brewer  |first=Ebenezer |year=1970 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn= |page=1132 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to E.&amp;nbsp;Cobham Brewer (1810–1897), ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', the same abbreviation mark was used for "habet" and "omnibus".&lt;/ref&gt; a common contraction for "et" in Latin shorthand in [[Ancient Rome]] and [[medieval Europe]].

==Usage==
''Viz.'' is an [[abbreviation]] of ''videlicet'', which itself is a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] from [[Latin]] of ''videre licet'' meaning "it is permitted to see".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|The New Fowler's Modern English Usage]]'' (revised third edition, 1998), pp. 825, 828.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1917&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''viz.'' is the continuation of an abbreviation using [[Tironian notes|Tironian ''et'']] (''vi⁊''), the ''z'' replacing the ''⁊'' once the latter had fallen out of common use.

In contradistinction to [[i.e.]] and [[exempli gratia|e.g.]], viz. is used to indicate a detailed description of something stated before, and when it precedes a list of group members, it implies (near) completeness.

* ''Viz.'' is usually read aloud as "that is", "namely", or "to wit",&lt;ref name="AMHER1917"&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes pronounced as it is spelt, viz.: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|z}}.
* ''Videlicet'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ᵻ|s|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|w|ɪ|ˈ|d|eɪ|l|ᵻ|k|ɛ|t}}.&lt;ref name="AMHER1917" /&gt;

===Examples===
* The main point of his speech, ''viz.'' that our attitude was in fact harmful, was not understood.
* "My grandfather had four sons who grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/148 ''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin''] at Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The noble gases, viz., helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton, and radon, show an unexpected behavior when exposed to this new element.

==Compared with scilicet (sc., ss., §)==
{{Main|Section sign}}
A similar expression is '''''scilicet''''' (from earlier ''scire licet''), abbreviated as ''sc.'', which is Latin for "it is permitted to know". ''Sc.'' provides a parenthetic clarification, removes an  ambiguity, or supplies a word omitted in preceding text,&amp;nbsp; while ''viz.'' is usually used to elaborate or detail text which precedes it.

In legal usage, ''scilicet'' appears abbreviated as ''ss.'' or, in a caption, as [[Section sign|§]], where it  provides a statement of venue{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} and is read as "to wit".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (sixth edition, 1990), p. 1403.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scilicet'' can be read as "namely", "to wit", or "that is to say", or pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|iː|l|ᵻ|k|ɛ|t}} or anglicized as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ᵻ|s|ɛ|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1560.&lt;/ref&gt;
